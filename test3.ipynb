      "Little Billee lodged at the Hôtel Corneille, in the Place de l'Odéon.\n",

      "\n",
      "Whatever they did, whatever they said, was simply perfect in his eyes;\n",

      "His absolute belief in all they said and did touched them none the less\n",

      "perception, in matters of form and color, a mysterious facility and\n",
      "felicity of execution, a sense of all that was sweet and beautiful in\n",
      "nature, and a ready power of expressing it, that had not been vouchsafed\n",
      "to them in any such generous profusion, and which, as they ungrudgingly\n",

      "to care for the Laird's guitar-playing toreador, nor for his serenaded\n",
      "lady--at all events, he never said anything about them, either in praise\n",
      "or blame. He looked at Taffy's realisms (for Taffy was a realist) in\n",
      "silence, and nothing tries true friendship so much as silence of this\n",
      "kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, then, to make up for it, when they all three went to the Louvre, he\n",
      "didn't seem to trouble much about Titian either, or Rembrandt, or\n",
      "Velasquez, Rubens, Veronese, or Leonardo. He looked at the people who\n",
      "looked at the pictures, instead of at the pictures themselves;\n",
      "especially at the people who copied them, the sometimes charming young\n",

      "attention, and reverentially agreed with all they said, and afterwards\n",
      "made the most delightfully funny little pen-and-ink sketches of them,\n",
      "saying all these beautiful things (which he sent to his mother and\n",
      "sister at home); so life-like, so real, that you could almost hear the\n",

      "masters couldn't have drawn them better themselves; and so irresistibly\n",
      "droll that you felt that the old masters could not have drawn them at\n",

      "\n",
      "First, a tall, bony individual of any age between thirty and forty-five,\n",

      "metal clasp at the collar. His thick, heavy, languid, lustreless black\n",
      "hair fell down behind his ears on to his shoulders, in that\n",
      "musicianlike way that is so offensive to the normal Englishman. He had\n",
      "bold, brilliant black eyes, with long, heavy lids, a thin, sallow face,\n",
      "and a beard of burnt-up black which grew almost from his under eyelids;\n",
      "and over it his mustache, a shade lighter, fell in two long spiral\n",
      "twists. He went by the name of Svengali, and spoke fluent French with a\n",
      "German accent, and humorous German twists and idioms, and his voice was\n",
      "very thin and mean and harsh, and often broke into a disagreeable\n",

      "\n",
      "His companion was a little swarthy young man--a gypsy, possibly--much\n",
      "pitted with the small-pox, and also very shabby. He had large, soft,\n",

      "when it rose and down when it fell, but with such immense intervals\n",

      "auld lang syne! But when they got there the well-remembered fumes of\n",
      "that humble refectory, which had once seemed not unappetizing, turned\n",

      "sons of the Gallic people (and its neatly shod, white-capped daughters)\n",
      "delightful to watch as they take their pleasure. And the Laird (thinking\n",

      "surprise as well as an enchantment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, no such band as Svengali's had ever been heard; and in\n",
      "listening to this overture the immense crowd almost forgot that it was a\n",
      "mere preparation for a great musical event, and tried to encore it. But\n",
      "Svengali merely turned round and bowed--there were to be no encores that\n",

      "quite a simple fashion, and made a slight inclination of her head and\n",

      "cheeks were rouged; her dark level eyebrows nearly met at the bridge of\n",

      "It was a warm and balmy night, almost like mid-summer; and they stopped\n",
      "at the first café they met on the Boulevard de la Madeleine (comme\n",
      "autrefois), and ordered bocks of beer, and sat at a little table on\n",
      "the pavement, the only one unoccupied; for the café was already crowded,\n",
      "the hum of lively talk was great, and \"la Svengali\" was in every mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Laird was the first to speak. He emptied his bock at a draught, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Then the Laird proceeded to explain that, putting aside the\n",

      "well-remembered loathing for Svengali, he had narrowly scanned her face\n",
      "through his opera-glass, and found that in spite of a likeness quite\n",
      "marvellous there were well-marked differences. Her face was narrower and\n",
      "longer, her eyes larger, and their expression not the same; then she\n",
      "seemed taller and stouter, and her shoulders broader and more drooping,\n",
      "and so forth.\n",

      "But the others wouldn't hear of it, and voted him cracked, and declared\n",
      "they even recognized the peculiar twang of her old speaking voice in the\n",
      "voice she now sang with, especially when she sang low down. And they all\n",
      "three fell to discussing the wonders of her performance like everybody\n",
      "else all round; Little Billee leading, with an eloquence and a seeming\n",
      "of technical musical knowledge that quite impressed them, and made them\n",
      "feel happy and at ease; for they were anxious for his sake about the\n",

      "after all that had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed transcendently happy and elate--incomprehensibly so, in\n",
      "fact--and looked at them both with quite a new light in his eyes, as if\n",
      "all the music he had heard had trebled not only his joy in being alive,\n",
      "but his pleasure at being with them. Evidently he had quite outgrown his\n",
      "old passion for her, and that was a comfort indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "But Little Billee knew better.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew that his old passion for her had all come back, and was so\n",
      "overwhelming and immense that he could not feel it just yet, nor yet the\n",
      "hideous pangs of a jealousy so consuming that it would burn up his life.\n",
      "He gave himself another twenty-four hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had not to wait so long. He woke up after a short, uneasy sleep\n",
      "that very night, to find that the flood was over him; and he realized\n",
      "how hopelessly, desperately, wickedly, insanely he loved this woman, who\n",
      "might have been his, but was now the wife of another man; a greater than\n",
      "he, and one to whom she owed it that she was more glorious than any\n",
      "other woman on earth--a queen among queens--a goddess! for what was any\n",
      "earthly throne compared to that she established in the hearts and souls\n",
      "of all who came within the sight and hearing of her! beautiful as she\n",
      "was besides--beautiful, beautiful! And what must be her love for the man\n",
      "who had taught her and trained her, and revealed her towering genius to\n",
      "herself and to the world!--a man resplendent also, handsome and tall and\n",
      "commanding--a great artist from the crown of his head to the sole of his\n",
      "foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "And the remembrance of them--hand in hand, master and pupil, husband and\n",
      "wife--smiling and bowing in the face of all that splendid tumult they\n",
      "had called forth and could not quell, stung and tortured and maddened\n",
      "him so that he could not lie still, but got up and raged and rampaged up\n",
      "and down his hot, narrow, stuffy bedroom, and longed for his old\n",
      "familiar brain-disease to come back and narcotize his trouble, and be\n",
      "his friend, and stay with him till he died!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Where was he to fly for relief from such new memories as these, which\n",
      "would never cease; and the old memories, and all the glamour and grace\n",
      "of them that had been so suddenly called out of the grave? And how could\n",
      "he escape, now that he felt the sight of her face and the sound of her\n",
      "voice would be a craving--a daily want--like that of some poor starving\n",
      "outcast for warmth and meat and drink?\n",
      "\n",
      "And little innocent, pathetic, ineffable, well-remembered sweetnesses of\n",
      "her changing face kept painting themselves on his retina; and\n",

      "all artistic sons of Adam, that plague and torment of the dramatic,\n",
      "plastic imagination, which can idealize so well, and yet realize, alas!\n",
      "so keenly. After three or four hours spent like this, he could stand it\n",
      "no longer; madness was lying his way. So he hurried on a garment, and\n",
      "went and knocked at Taffy's door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good God! what's the matter with you?\" exclaimed the good Taffy, as\n",
      "Little Billee tumbled into his room, calling out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Taffy, Taffy, I've g-g-gone mad, I think!\" And then, shivering all\n",
      "over, and stammering incoherently, he tried to tell his friend what was\n",
      "the matter with him, with great simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taffy, in much alarm, slipped on his trousers and made Little Billee get\n",
      "into his bed, and sat by his side holding his hand. He was greatly\n",
      "perplexed, fearing the recurrence of another attack like that of five\n",
      "years back. He didn't dare leave him for an instant to wake the Laird\n",
      "and send for a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Little Billee buried his face in the pillow and began to sob,\n",
      "and some instinct told Taffy this was the best thing that could happen.\n",
      "The boy had always been a highly strung, emotional, over-excitable,\n",
      "over-sensitive, and quite uncontrolled mammy's-darling, a cry-baby sort\n",
      "of chap, who had never been to school. It was all a part of his genius,\n",
      "and also a part of his charm. It would do him good once more to have a\n",
      "good blub after five years! After a while Little Billee grew quieter,\n",
      "and then suddenly he said: \"What a miserable ass you must think me, what\n",

      "\"Why, my friend?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "to make the best of it. She's another man's wife, and probably she's\n",

The walls were of the\\nusual dull red, relieved by plaster casts of arms and legs and hands and\\nfeet; and Dante's mask, and Michael Angelo's altorilievo of Leda and the\\nswan, and a centaur and Lapith from the Elgin marbles--on none of these\\nhad the dust as yet had time to settle.\", 'There were also studies in oil from the nude; copies of Titian,\\nRembrandt, Velasquez, Rubens, Tintoret, Leonardo da Vinci--none of the\\nschool of Botticelli, Mantegna, and Co.--a firm whose merits had not as\\nyet been revealed to the many.', \"Along the walls, at a great height, ran a broad shelf, on which were\\nother casts in plaster, terra-cotta, imitation bronze; a little Theseus,\\na little Venus of Milo, a little discobolus; a little flayed man\\nthreatening high heaven (an act that seemed almost pardonable under the\\ncircumstances!); a lion and a boar by Barye; an anatomical figure of a\\nhorse with only one leg left and no ears; a horse's head from the\\npediment of the Parthenon, earless also; and the bust of Clytie, with\\nher beautiful low brow, her sweet wan gaze, and the ineffable forward\\nshrug of her dear shoulders that makes her bosom a nest, a rest, a\\npillow, a refuge--to be loved and desired forever by generation after\\ngeneration of the sons of men.\", \"Near the stove hung a gridiron, a frying-pan, a toasting-fork, and a\\npair of bellows. In an adjoining glazed corner cupboard were plates and\\nglasses, black-handled knives, pewter spoons, and three-pronged steel\\nforks; a salad-bowl, vinegar cruets, an oil-flask, two mustard-pots\\n(English and French), and such like things--all scrupulously clean. On\\nthe floor, which had been stained and waxed at considerable cost, lay\\ntwo chetah-skins and a large Persian praying-rug. One-half of it,\\nhowever (under the trapeze and at the farthest end from the window,\\nbeyond the model throne), was covered with coarse matting, that one\\nmight fence or box without slipping down and splitting one's self in\\ntwo, or fall without breaking any bones.\", 'Two other windows of the usual French size and pattern, with shutters to\\nthem and heavy curtains of baize, opened east and west, to let in dawn\\nor sunset, as the case might be, or haply keep them out. And there were\\nalcoves, recesses, irregularities, odd little nooks and corners, to be\\nfilled up as time wore on with endless personal knick-knacks, bibelots,\\nprivate properties and acquisitions--things that make a place genial,\\nhomelike, and good to remember, and sweet to muse upon (with fond\\nregret) in after-years.', \"And an immense divan spread itself in width and length and delightful\\nthickness just beneath the big north window, the business window--a\\ndivan so immense that three well-fed, well-contented Englishmen could\\nall lie lazily smoking their pipes on it at once without being in each\\nother's way, and very often did!\", 'At present one of these Englishmen--a Yorkshireman, by-the-way, called\\nTaffy (and also the Man of Blood, because he was supposed to be\\ndistantly related to a baronet)--was more energetically engaged.\\nBare-armed, and in his shirt and trousers, he was twirling a pair of\\nIndian clubs round his head. His face was flushed, and he was perspiring\\nfreely and looked fierce. He was a very big young man, fair, with kind\\nbut choleric blue eyes, and the muscles of his brawny arm were strong as\\niron bands.', \"For three years he had borne her Majesty's commission, and had been\\nthrough the Crimean campaign without a scratch. He would have been one\\nof the famous six hundred in the famous charge at Balaklava but for a\\nsprained ankle (caught playing leapfrog in the trenches), which kept him\\nin hospital on that momentous day. So that he lost his chance of glory\\nor the grave, and this humiliating misadventure had sickened him of\\nsoldiering for life, and he never quite got over it. Then, feeling\\nwithin himself an irresistible vocation for art, he had sold out; and\\nhere he was in Paris, hard at work, as we see.\", '', \"He was good-looking, with straight features; but I regret to say that,\\nbesides his heavy plunger's mustache, he wore an immense pair of\\ndrooping auburn whiskers, of the kind that used to be called Piccadilly\\nweepers, and were afterwards affected by Mr. Sothern in Lord Dundreary.\\nIt was a fashion to do so then for such of our gilded youth as could\\nafford the time (and the hair); the bigger and fairer the whiskers, the\\nmore beautiful was thought the youth!

And here he was in Paris\\nfamous, painting toreadors, and spouting the \"Ballad of the\\nBouillabaisse,\" as he would often do out of sheer lightness of\\nheart--much oftener, indeed, than he would say his prayers.', 'Kneeling on the divan, with his elbow on the window-sill, was a third\\nand much younger youth. The third he was \"Little Billee.\" He had pulled\\ndown the green baize blind, and was looking over the roofs and\\nchimney-pots of Paris and all about with all his eyes, munching the\\nwhile a roll and a savory saveloy, in which there was evidence of much\\ngarlic. He ate with great relish, for he was very hungry; he had been\\nall the morning at Carrel\\'s studio, drawing from the life.', 'Little Billee was small and slender, about twenty or twenty-one, and had\\na straight white forehead veined with blue, large dark-blue eyes,\\ndelicate, regular features, and coal-black hair. He was also very\\ngraceful and well built, with very small hands and feet, and much better\\ndressed than his friends, who went out of their way to outdo the\\ndenizens of the quartier latin in careless eccentricity of garb, and\\nsucceeded. And in his winning and handsome face there was just a faint\\nsuggestion of some possible very remote Jewish ancestor--just a tinge of\\nthat strong, sturdy, irrepressible, indomitable, indelible blood which\\nis of such priceless value in diluted homœopathic doses, like the dry\\nwhite Spanish wine called montijo, which is not meant to be taken pure;\\nbut without a judicious admixture of which no sherry can go round the\\nworld and keep its flavor intact; or like the famous bull-dog strain,\\nwhich is not beautiful in itself; and yet just for lacking a little of\\nthe same no greyhound can ever hope to be a champion. So, at least, I\\nhave been told by wine-merchants and dog-fanciers--the most veracious\\npersons that can be. Fortunately for the world, and especially for\\nourselves, most of us have in our veins at least a minim of that\\nprecious fluid, whether we know it or show it or not. Tant pis pour les\\nautres!', 'As Little Billee munched he also gazed at the busy place below--the\\nPlace St. Anatole des Arts--at the old houses opposite, some of which\\nwere being pulled down, no doubt lest they should fall of their own\\nsweet will. In the gaps between he would see discolored, old, cracked,\\ndingy walls, with mysterious windows and rusty iron balconies of great\\nantiquity--sights that set him dreaming dreams of mediæval French love\\nand wickedness and crime, bygone mysteries of Paris!', '', 'One gap went right through the block, and gave him a glimpse of the\\nriver, the \"Cité,\" and the ominous old Morgue; a little to the right\\nrose the gray towers of Notre Dame de Paris into the checkered April\\nsky. Indeed, the top of nearly all Paris lay before him, with a little\\nstretch of the imagination on his part; and he gazed with a sense of\\nnovelty, an interest and a pleasure for which he could not have found\\nany expression in mere language.', 'Paris! Paris!! Paris!!!', 'The very name had always been one to conjure with, whether he thought of\\nit as a mere sound on the lips and in the ear, or as a magical written\\nor printed word for the eye.

And yet his life had been a happy one. He was young and\\ntender, was Little Billee; he had never been to any school, and was\\ninnocent of the world and its wicked ways; innocent of French\\nespecially, and the ways of Paris and its Latin quarter. He had been\\nbrought up and educated at home, had spent his boyhood in London with\\nhis mother and sister, who now lived in Devonshire on somewhat\\nstraitened means. His father, who was dead, had been a clerk in the\\nTreasury.', \"He and his two friends, Taffy and the Laird, had taken this studio\\ntogether.

On the other\\nhand, Taffy and the Laird were as fond of the boy as they could be.', 'His absolute belief in all they said and did touched them none the less\\nthat they were conscious of its being somewhat in excess of their\\ndeserts. His almost girlish purity of mind amused and charmed them, and\\nthey did all they could to preserve it, even in the quartier latin,\\nwhere purity is apt to go bad if it be kept too long.', '', 'They loved him for his affectionate disposition, his lively and\\ncaressing ways; and they admired him far more than he ever knew, for\\nthey recognized in him a quickness, a keenness, a delicacy of\\nperception, in matters of form and color, a mysterious facility and\\nfelicity of execution, a sense of all that was sweet and beautiful in\\nnature, and a ready power of expressing it, that had not been vouchsafed\\nto them in any such generous profusion, and which, as they ungrudgingly\\nadmitted to themselves and each other, amounted to true genius.', 'And when one within the immediate circle of our intimates is gifted in\\nthis abnormal fashion, we either hate or love him for it, in proportion\\nto the greatness of his gift; according to the way we are built.', \"So Taffy and the Laird loved Little Billee--loved him very much indeed.\\nNot but what Little Billee had his faults. For instance, he didn't\\ninterest himself very warmly in other people's pictures. He didn't seem\\nto care for the Laird's guitar-playing toreador, nor for his serenaded\\nlady--at all events, he never said anything about them, either in praise\\nor blame. He looked at Taffy's realisms (for Taffy was a realist) in\\nsilence, and nothing tries true friendship so much as silence of this\\nkind.\", \"But, then, to make up for it, when they all three went to the Louvre, he\\ndidn't seem to trouble much about Titian either, or Rembrandt, or\\nVelasquez, Rubens, Veronese, or Leonardo. He looked at the people who\\nlooked at the pictures, instead of at the pictures themselves;\\nespecially at the people who copied them, the sometimes charming young\\nlady painters--and these seemed to him even more charming than they\\nreally were--and he looked a great deal out of the Louvre windows,\\nwhere there was much to be seen: more Paris, for instance--Paris, of\\nwhich he could never have enough.\", \"But when, surfeited with classical beauty, they all three went and dined\\ntogether, and Taffy and the Laird said beautiful things about the old\\nmasters, and quarrelled about them, he listened with deference and rapt\\nattention, and reverentially agreed with all they said, and afterwards\\nmade the most delightfully funny little pen-and-ink sketches of them,\\nsaying all these beautiful things (which he sent to his mother and\\nsister at home); so life-like, so real, that you could almost hear the\\nbeautiful things they said; so beautifully drawn that you felt the old\\nmasters couldn't have drawn them better themselves; and so irresistibly\\ndroll that you felt that the old masters could not have drawn them at\\nall--any more than Milton could have described the quarrel between\\nSairey Gamp and Betsy Prig; no one, in short, but Little Billee.\", 'Little Billee took up the \"Ballad of the Bouillabaisse\" where the Laird\\nhad left it off, and speculated on the future of himself and his\\nfriends, when he should have got to forty years--an almost impossibly\\nremote future.', 'These speculations were interrupted by a loud knock at the door, and two\\nmen came in.', 'First, a tall, bony individual of any age between thirty and forty-five,\\nof Jewish aspect, well-featured but sinister. He was very shabby and\\ndirty, and wore a red béret and a large velveteen cloak, with a big\\nmetal clasp at the collar. His thick, heavy, languid, lustreless black\\nhair fell down behind his ears on to his shoulders, in that\\nmusicianlike way that is so offensive to the normal Englishman. He had\\nbold, brilliant black eyes, with long, heavy lids, a thin, sallow face,\\nand a beard of burnt-up black which grew almost from his under eyelids;\\nand over it his mustache, a shade lighter, fell in two long spiral\\ntwists. He went by the name of Svengali, and spoke fluent French with a\\nGerman accent, and humorous German twists and idioms, and his voice was\\nvery thin and mean and harsh, and often broke into a disagreeable\\nfalsetto.', 'His companion was a little swarthy young man--a gypsy, possibly--much\\npitted with the small-pox, and also very shabby. He had large, soft,\\naffectionate brown eyes, like a King Charles spaniel. He had small,\\nnervous, veiny hands, with nails bitten down to the quick, and carried a\\nfiddle and a fiddlestick under his arm, without a case, as though he had\\nbeen playing in the street.', '\"Ponchour, mes enfants,\" said Svengali. \"Che vous amène mon ami Checko,\\nqui choue du fiolon gomme un anche!\"', 'Little Billee, who adored all \"sweet musicianers,\" jumped up and made\\nGecko as warmly welcome as he could in his early French.', '\"Ha! le biâno!\" exclaimed Svengali, flinging his red béret on it, and\\nhis cloak on the ground. \"Ch\\'espère qu\\'il est pon, et pien t\\'accord!\"', 'And sitting down on the music-stool, he ran up and down the scales with\\nthat easy power, that smooth, even crispness of touch, which reveal the\\nmaster.', '', 'Then he fell to playing Chopin\\'s impromptu in A flat, so beautifully\\nthat Little Billee\\'s heart went nigh to bursting with suppressed\\nemotion and delight. He had never heard any music of Chopin\\'s before,\\nnothing but British provincial home-made music--melodies with\\nvariations, \"Annie Laurie,\" \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" \"The Blue Bells\\nof Scotland;\" innocent little motherly and sisterly tinklings, invented\\nto set the company at their ease on festive evenings, and make all-round\\nconversation possible for shy people; who fear the unaccompanied sound\\nof their own voices, and whose genial chatter always leaves off directly\\nthe music ceases.', 'He never forgot that impromptu, which he was destined to hear again one\\nday in strange circumstances.', 'Then Svengali and Gecko made music together, divinely. Little\\nfragmentary things, sometimes consisting but of a few bars, but these\\nbars of such beauty and meaning! Scraps, snatches, short melodies,\\nmeant to fetch, to charm immediately, or to melt or sadden or madden\\njust for a moment, and that knew just when to leave off--czardas, gypsy\\ndances, Hungarian love-plaints, things little known out of eastern\\nEurope in the fifties of this century, till the Laird and Taffy were\\nalmost as wild in their enthusiasm as Little Billee--a silent enthusiasm\\ntoo deep for speech. And when these two great artists left off to smoke,\\nthe three Britishers were too much moved even for that, and there was a\\nstillness...', 'Suddenly there came a loud knuckle-rapping at the outer door, and a\\nportentous voice of great volume, and that might almost have belonged to\\nany sex (even an angel\\'s), uttered the British milkman\\'s yodel,\"Milk\\nbelow!\" and before any one could say \"Entrez,\" a strange figure\\nappeared, framed by the gloom of the little antechamber.', 'It was the figure of a very tall and fully developed young female, clad\\nin the gray overcoat of a French infantry soldier, continued netherwards\\nby a short striped petticoat, beneath which were visible her bare white\\nankles and insteps, and slim, straight, rosy heels, clean cut and smooth\\nas the back of a razor; her toes lost themselves in a huge pair of male\\nlist slippers, which made her drag her feet as she walked.', 'She bore herself with easy, unembarrassed grace, like a person whose\\nnerves and muscles are well in tune, whose spirits are high, who has\\nlived much in the atmosphere of French studios, and feels at home in it.', 'This strange medley of garments was surmounted by a small bare head with\\nshort, thick, wavy brown hair, and a very healthy young face, which\\ncould scarcely be called quite beautiful at first sight, since the eyes\\nwere too wide apart, the mouth too large, the chin too massive, the\\ncomplexion a mass of freckles. Besides, you can never tell how beautiful\\n(or how ugly) a face may be till you have tried to draw it.', 'But a small portion of her neck, down by the collar-bone, which just\\nshowed itself between the unbuttoned lapels of her military coat collar,\\nwas of a delicate privetlike whiteness that is never to be found on any\\nFrench neck, and very few English ones. Also, she had a very fine brow,\\nbroad and low, with thick level eyebrows much darker than her hair, a\\nbroad, bony, high bridge to her short nose, and her full, broad cheeks\\nwere beautifully modelled. She would have made a singularly handsome\\nboy.', 'As the creature looked round at the assembled company and flashed her\\nbig white teeth at them in an all-embracing smile of uncommon width and\\nquite irresistible sweetness, simplicity, and friendly trust, one saw at\\na glance that she was out of the common clever, simple, humorous,\\nhonest, brave, and kind, and accustomed to be genially welcomed wherever\\nshe went. Then suddenly closing the door behind her, dropping her smile,\\nand looking wistful and sweet, with her head on one side and her arms\\nakimbo, \"Ye\\'re all English, now, aren\\'t ye?\" she exclaimed. \"I heard the\\nmusic, and thought I\\'d just come in for a bit, and pass the time of day:\\nyou don\\'t mind?

I\\'m sure she\\'s quite a lady.\"', \"And in five minutes or so, with the point of an old compass, he\\nscratched in white on the dark red wall a three-quarter profile outline\\nof Trilby's left foot, which was perhaps the more perfect poem of the\\ntwo.\", \"Slight as it was, this little piece of impromptu etching, in its sense\\nof beauty, in its quick seizing of a peculiar individuality, its subtle\\nrendering of a strongly received impression, was already the work of a\\nmaster.

He sang it very nicely with his pleasant little throaty English\\nbarytone.', '', \"It was solely in order that Little Billee should have opportunities of\\npractising this graceful accomplishment of his, for his own and his\\nfriends' delectation, that the piano had been sent over from London,\\nat great cost to Taffy and the Laird. It had belonged to Taffy's mother,\\nwho was dead.\", 'Before he had finished the second verse, Svengali exclaimed: \"Mais c\\'est\\ntout-à-fait chentil! Allons, Gecko, chouez-nous ça!\"', 'And he put his big hands on the piano, over Little Billee\\'s, pushed him\\noff the music-stool with his great gaunt body, and, sitting on it\\nhimself, he played a masterly prelude. It was impressive to hear the\\ncomplicated richness and volume of the sounds he evoked after Little\\nBillee\\'s gentle \"tink-a-tink.\"', \"And Gecko, cuddling lovingly his violin and closing his upturned eyes,\\nplayed that simple melody as it had probably never been played\\nbefore--such passion, such pathos, such a tone!--and they turned it and\\ntwisted it, and went from one key to another, playing into each other's\\nhands, Svengali taking the lead; and fugued and canoned and\\ncounterpointed and battle-doored and shuttlecocked it, high and low,\\nsoft and loud, in minor, in pizzicato, and in sordino--adagio, andante,\\nallegretto, scherzo--and exhausted all its possibilities of beauty; till\\ntheir susceptible audience of three was all but crazed with delight and\\nwonder; and the masterful Ben Bolt, and his over-tender Alice, and his\\ntoo submissive friend, and his old schoolmaster so kind and so true, and\\nhis long-dead schoolmates, and the rustic porch and the mill, and the\\nslab of granite so gray,\", '    \"And the dear little nook\\n     By the clear running brook,\"', \"were all magnified into a strange, almost holy poetic dignity and\\nsplendor quite undreamed of by whoever wrote the words and music of that\\nunsophisticated little song, which has touched so many simple British\\nhearts that don't know any better--and among them, once, that of the\\npresent scribe--long, long ago!\", '\"Sacrepleu! il choue pien, le Checko, hein?\" said Svengali, when they\\nhad brought this wonderful double improvisation to a climax and a close.\\n\"C\\'est mon élèfe! che le fais chanter sur son fiolon, c\\'est comme si\\nc\\'était moi qui chantais! ach! si ch\\'afais pour teux sous de voix, che\\nserais le bremier chanteur du monte!

(I\\nwill translate him into English, without attempting to translate his\\naccent, which is a mere matter of judiciously transposing p\\'s and b\\'s,\\nand t\\'s and d\\'s, and f\\'s and v\\'s, and g\\'s and k\\'s, and turning the soft\\nFrench j into sch, and a pretty language into an ugly one.)', '\"I cannot sing myself, I cannot play the violin, but I can teach--hein,\\nGecko? And I have a pupil--hein, Gecko?--la betite Honorine;\" and here\\nhe leered all round with a leer that was not engaging. \"The world shall\\nhear of la betite Honorine some day--hein, Gecko? Listen all--this is\\nhow I teach la betite Honorine! Gecko, play me a little accompaniment in\\npizzicato.\"', 'And he pulled out of his pocket a kind of little flexible flageolet (of\\nhis own invention, it seems), which he screwed together and put to his\\nlips, and on this humble instrument he played \"Ben Bolt,\" while Gecko\\naccompanied him, using his fiddle as a guitar, his adoring eyes fixed in\\nreverence on his master.', 'And it would be impossible to render in any words the deftness, the\\ndistinction, the grace, power, pathos, and passion with which this truly\\nphenomenal artist executed the poor old twopenny tune on his elastic\\npenny whistle--for it was little more--such thrilling, vibrating,\\npiercing tenderness, now loud and full, a shrill scream of anguish, now\\nsoft as a whisper, a mere melodic breath, more human almost than the\\nhuman voice itself, a perfection unattainable even by Gecko, a master,\\non an instrument which is the acknowledged king of all!', \"So that the tear which had been so close to the brink of Little Billee's\\neye while Gecko was playing now rose and trembled under his eyelid and\\nspilled itself down his nose; and he had to dissemble and\\nsurreptitiously mop it up with his little finger as he leaned his chin\\non his hand, and cough a little husky, unnatural cough--pour se donner\\nune contenance!\", 'He had never heard such music as this, never dreamed such music was\\npossible. He was conscious, while it lasted, that he saw deeper into the\\nbeauty, the sadness of things, the very heart of them, and their\\npathetic evanescence, as with a new, inner eye--even into eternity\\nitself, beyond the veil--a vague cosmic vision that faded when the music\\nwas over, but left an unfading reminiscence of its having been, and a\\npassionate desire to express the like some day through the plastic\\nmedium of his own beautiful art.', '', 'When Svengali ended, he leered again on his dumb-struck audience, and\\nsaid: \"That is how I teach la betite Honorine to sing; that is how I\\nteach Gecko to play; that is how I teach \\'il bel canto\\'! It was\\nlost, the bel canto--but I found it, in a dream--I, and nobody\\nelse--I--Svengali--I--I--I! But that is enough of music; let us play\\nat something else--let us play at this!\" he cried, jumping up and\\nseizing a foil and bending it against the wall... \"Come along, Little\\nPillee, and I will show you something more you don\\'t know...\"', 'So Little Billee took off coat and waistcoat, donned mask and glove and\\nfencing-shoes, and they had an \"assault of arms,\" as it is nobly called\\nin French, and in which poor Little Billee came off very badly. The\\nGerman Pole fenced wildly, but well.', 'Then it was the Laird\\'s turn, and he came off badly too; so then Taffy\\ntook up the foil, and redeemed the honor of Great Britain, as became a\\nBritish hussar and a Man of Blood. For Taffy, by long and assiduous\\npractice in the best school in Paris (and also by virtue of his native\\naptitudes), was a match for any maître d\\'armes in the whole French army,\\nand Svengali got \"what for.\"', 'And when it was time to give up play and settle down to work, others\\ndropped in--French, English, Swiss, German, American, Greek; curtains\\nwere drawn and shutters opened; the studio was flooded with light--and\\nthe afternoon was healthily spent in athletic and gymnastic exercises\\ntill dinner-time.', \"But Little Billee, who had had enough of fencing and gymnastics for the\\nday, amused himself by filling up with black and white and red\\nchalk-strokes the outline of Trilby's foot on the wall, lest he should\\nforget his fresh vision of it, which was still to him as the thing\\nitself--an absolute reality, born of a mere glance, a mere chance.\", 'Durien came in and looked over his shoulder, and exclaimed: \"Tiens! le\\npied de Trilby! vous avez fait ça d\\'après nature?\"', '\"Nong!\"', '\"De mémoire, alors?\"', '\"Wee!\"', '\"Je vous en fais mon compliment!

De\\ngrâce, n\\'y touchez plus!\"', 'And Little Billee was pleased, and touched it no more; for Durien was a\\ngreat sculptor, and sincerity itself.', '', 'And then--well, I happen to forget what sort of day this particular day\\nturned into at about six of the clock.', \"If it was decently fine, the most of them went off to dine at the\\nRestaurant de la Couronne, kept by the Père Trin, in the Rue de\\nMonsieur, who gave you of his best to eat and drink for twenty sols\\nParisis, or one franc in the coin of the empire. Good distending soups,\\nomelets that were only too savory, lentils, red and white beans, meat so\\ndressed and sauced and seasoned that you didn't know whether it were\\nbeef or mutton--flesh, fowl, or good red herring--or even bad, for that\\nmatter--nor very greatly care.\", 'And just the same lettuce, radishes, and cheese of Gruyère or Brie as\\nyou got at the Trois Frères Provençaux (but not the same butter!).

And the evening was\\ninnocently wound up with billiards, cards, or dominos at the Café du\\nLuxembourg opposite; or at the Théâtre du Luxembourg, in the Rue de\\nMadame, to see funny farces with screamingly droll Englishmen in them;\\nor, still better, at the Jardin Bullier (la Closerie des Lilas), to see\\nthe students dance the cancan, or try and dance it yourself, which is\\nnot so easy as it seems; or, best of all, at the Théâtre de l'Odéon, to\\nsee some piece of classical repertoire.\", \"Or, if it were not only fine, but a Saturday afternoon into the bargain,\\nthe Laird would put on a necktie and a few other necessary things, and\\nthe three friends would walk arm in arm to Taffy's hotel in the Rue de\\nSeine, and wait outside till he had made himself as presentable as the\\nLaird, which did not take very long. And then (Little Billee was always\\npresentable) they would, arm in arm, the huge Taffy in the middle,\\ndescend the Rue de Seine and cross a bridge to the Cité, and have a look\\nin at the Morgue. Then back again to the quays on the rive gauche by the\\nPont Neuf, to wend their way westward; now on one side to look at the\\nprint and picture shops and the magasins of bric-à-brac, and haply\\nsometimes buy thereof, now on the other to finger and cheapen the\\nsecond-hand books for sale on the parapet, and even pick up one or two\\nutterly unwanted bargains, never to be read or opened again.\", \"When they reached the Pont des Arts they would cross it, stopping in the\\nmiddle to look up the river towards the old Cité and Notre Dame,\\neastward, and dream unutterable things, and try to utter them. Then,\\nturning westward, they would gaze at the glowing sky and all it glowed\\nupon--the corner of the Tuileries and the Louvre, the many bridges, the\\nChamber of Deputies, the golden river narrowing its perspective and\\nbroadening its bed as it went flowing and winding on its way between\\nPassy and Grenelle to St. Cloud, to Rouen, to the Havre, to England\\nperhaps--where they didn't want to be just then; and they would try\\nand express themselves to the effect that life was uncommonly well worth\\nliving in that particular city at that particular time of the day and\\nyear and century, at that particular epoch of their own mortal and\\nuncertain lives.\", 'Then, still arm in arm and chatting gayly, across the court-yard of the\\nLouvre, through gilded gates well guarded by reckless imperial Zouaves,\\nup the arcaded Rue de Rivoli as far as the Rue Castiglione, where they\\nwould stare with greedy eyes at the window of the great corner\\npastry-cook, and marvel at the beautiful assortment of bonbons,\\npralines, dragées, marrons glacés--saccharine, crystalline substances of\\nall kinds and colors, as charming to look at as an illumination;\\nprecious stones, delicately frosted sweets, pearls and diamonds so\\narranged as to melt in the mouth; especially, at this particular time of\\nthe year, the monstrous Easter-eggs of enchanting hue, enshrined like\\ncostly jewels in caskets of satin and gold; and the Laird, who was well\\nread in his English classics and liked to show it, would opine that\\n\"they managed these things better in France.\"', 'Then across the street by a great gate into the Allée des Feuillants,\\nand up to the Place de la Concorde--to gaze, but quite without base\\nenvy, at the smart people coming back from the Bois de Boulogne.

But now and\\nagain, during sleep, and in a blissful dream, the lost power of\\nloving--of loving mother, sister, friend--would be restored to him; just\\nas with a blind man who sometimes dreams he has recovered his sight; and\\nthe joy of it would wake him to the sad reality: till he got to know,\\neven in his dream, that he was only dreaming, after all, whenever that\\npriceless boon seemed to be his own once more--and did his utmost not to\\nwake. And these were nights to be marked with a white stone, and\\nremembered!', 'And nowhere was he happier than at the houses of the great surgeons and\\nphysicians who interested themselves in his strange disease.

They\\nalso had much to say--but they didn't say very much about Paris, for\\nfear of waking up Heaven knows what sleeping dogs!\", \"And every now and again, in the midst of all this pleasant foregathering\\nand communion of long-parted friends, the pangs of Little Billee's\\nmiserable mind-malady would shoot through him like poisoned arrows.\", 'He would catch himself thinking how fat and fussy and serious about\\ntrifles Taffy had become; and what a shiftless, feckless, futile duffer\\nwas the Laird; and how greedy they both were, and how red and coarse\\ntheir ears and gills and cheeks grew as they fed, and how shiny their\\nfaces; and how little he would care, try as he might, if they both fell\\ndown dead under the table! And this would make him behave more\\ncaressingly to them, more genially and demonstratively than ever--for he\\nknew it was all a grewsome physical ailment of his own, which he could\\nno more help than a cataract in his eye!', \"Then, catching sight of his own face and form in a mirror, he would\\ncurse himself for a puny, misbegotten shrimp, an imp--an abortion--no\\nbigger, by the side of the herculean Taffy or the burly Laird of\\nCockpen, than six-pennorth o' half-pence: a wretched little overrated\\nfollower of a poor trivial craft--a mere light amuser!

And right through the ragged lawn, (where lay,\\nupset in the long dewy grass, a broken doll\\'s perambulator by a tattered\\nPunchinello) went a desecrating track made by cart-wheels and horses\\'\\nhoofs; and this, no doubt, was to be a new street--perhaps, as Taffy\\nsuggested, \"La Rue Neuve des Mauvais Ladres!\" (The New Street of the\\nBad Lepers!).', '\"Ah, Taffy!\" sententiously opined the Laird, with his usual wink at\\nLittle Billee, \"I\\'ve no doubt the old lepers were the best, bad as\\nthey were!\"', '\"I\\'m quite sure of it!\" said Taffy, with sad and sober conviction and\\na long-drawn sigh. \"I only wish I had a chance of painting one--just as\\nhe really was!\"', 'How often they had speculated on what lay hidden behind that lofty old\\nbrick wall! and now this melancholy little peep into the once festive\\npast, the touching sight of this odd old poverty-stricken abode of\\nHeaven knows what present grief and desolation, which a few strokes of\\nthe pickaxe had laid bare, seemed to chime in with their own gray mood\\nthat had been so bright and sunny an hour ago; and they went on their\\nway quite dejectedly, for a stroll through the Luxembourg Gallery and\\nGardens.', 'The same people seemed to be still copying the same pictures in the\\nlong, quiet, genial room, so pleasantly smelling of oil-paint--Rosa\\nBonheur\\'s \"Labourage Nivernais\"--Hébert\\'s \"Malaria\"--Couture\\'s \"Decadent\\nRomans.\"', 'And in the formal dusty gardens were the same pioupious and zouzous\\nstill walking with the same nounous, or sitting by their sides on\\nbenches by formal ponds with gold and silver fish in them--and just the\\nsame old couples petting the same toutous and loulous!', '', \"Then they thought they would go and lunch at le père Trin's--the\\nRestaurant de la Couronne, in the Rue du Luxembourg--for the sake of\\nauld lang syne!

It was no longer Pierrot and Columbine--it was Marguerite--it\\nwas Faust! It was the most terrible and pathetic of all possible human\\ntragedies, but expressed with no dramatic or histrionic exaggeration of\\nany sort; by mere tone, slight, subtle changes in the quality of the\\nsound--too quick and elusive to be taken count of, but to be felt with,\\noh, what poignant sympathy!', 'When the song was over the applause did not come immediately, and she\\nwaited with her kind wide smile, as if she were well accustomed to wait\\nlike this; and then the storm began, and grew and spread and rattled and\\nechoed--voice, hands, feet, sticks, umbrellas!--and down came the\\nbouquets, which the little page-boys picked up; and Trilby bowed to\\nfront and right and left in her simple débonnaire fashion. It was her\\nusual triumph. It had never failed, whatever the audience, whatever the\\ncountry, whatever the song.', \"Little Billee didn't applaud.

She had not much ear. But she had such a\\nvoice as had never been heard. Svengali knew that. He had found it out\\nlong ago. Litolff had found it out, too. One day Svengali heard Litolff\\ntell Meyerbeer that the most beautiful female voice in Europe belonged\\nto an English grisette who sat as a model to sculptors in the quartier\\nlatin, but that unfortunately she was quite tone-deaf, and couldn\\'t sing\\none single note in tune. Imagine how Svengali chuckled! I see it from\\nhere!', '\"Well, we both taught her together--for three years--morning, noon, and\\nnight--six--eight hours a day. It used to split me the heart to see her\\nworked like that! We took her voice note by note--there was no end to\\nher notes, each more beautiful than the other--velvet and gold,\\nbeautiful flowers, pearls, diamonds, rubies--drops of dew and honey;\\npeaches, oranges, and lemons! en veux-tu en voilà!--all the perfumes and\\nspices of the Garden of Eden! Svengali with his little flexible\\nflageolet, I with my violin--that is how we taught her to make the\\nsounds--and then how to use them. She was a phénomène, monsieur! She\\ncould keep on one note and make it go through all the colors in the\\nrainbow--according to the way Svengali looked at her. It would make you\\nlaugh--it would make you cry--but, cry or laugh, it was the sweetest,\\nthe most touching, the most beautiful note you ever heard--except all\\nher others! and each had as many overtones as the bells in the Carillon\\nde Notre Dame. She could run up and down the scales, chromatic scales,\\nquicker and better and smoother than Svengali on the piano, and more in\\ntune than any piano! and her shake--ach! twin stars, monsieur! She was\\nthe greatest contralto, the greatest soprano the world has ever known!\\nthe like of her has never been! the like of her will never be again! and\\nyet she only sang in public for two years.', '', '\"Ach! those breaks and runs and sudden leaps from darkness into light\\nand back again--from earth to heaven!... those slurs and swoops and\\nslides à la Paganini from one note to another, like a swallow\\nflying!... or a gull!

That was Svengali ... he was a magician!', '\"And how she looked, singing! do you remember? her hands behind her--her\\ndear, sweet, slender foot on a little stool--her thick hair lying down\\nall along her back! And that good smile like the Madonna\\'s so soft and\\nbright and kind! Ach! Bel ucel di Dio! it was to make you weep for\\nlove, merely to see her (c\\'était à vous faire pleurer d\\'amour, rien que\\nde la voir)! That was Trilby! Nightingale and bird-of-paradise in one!', '\"Enfin she could do anything--utter any sound she liked, when once\\nSvengali had shown her how--and he was the greatest master that ever\\nlived! and when once she knew a thing, she knew it. Et voilà!\"', '\"How strange,\" said Taffy, \"that she should have suddenly gone out of\\nher senses that night at Drury Lane, and so completely forgotten it all!\\nI suppose she saw Svengali die in the box opposite, and that drove her\\nmad!\"', \"And then Taffy told the little fiddler about Trilby's death-song, like a\\nswan's, and Svengali's photograph. But Gecko had heard it all from\\nMarta, who was now dead.\", 'Gecko sat and smoked and pondered for a while, and looked from one to\\nthe other.

There was the Trilby you knew, who could not\\nsing one single note in tune. She was an angel of paradise.

She could never tell one tune from another--one\\nnote from the next. Do you remember how she tried to sing \\'Ben Bolt\\'\\nthat day when she first came to the studio in the Place St. Anatole des\\nArts? It was droll, hein? à se boucher les oreilles! Well, that was\\nTrilby, your Trilby! that was my Trilby too--and I loved her as one\\nloves an only love, an only sister, an only child--a gentle martyr on\\nearth, a blessed saint in heaven! And that Trilby was enough for me!', '\"And that was the Trilby that loved your brother, madame--oh! but with\\nall the love that was in her! He did not know what he had lost, your\\nbrother!

She told me everything! ce pauvre\\nLitrebili, ce qu\\'il a perdu!', '\"But all at once--pr-r-r-out! presto! augenblick!... with one wave of\\nhis hand over her--with one look of his eye--with a word--Svengali could\\nturn her into the other Trilby, his Trilby, and make her do whatever\\nhe liked ... you might have run a red-hot needle into her and she would\\nnot have felt it...', '\"He had but to say \\'Dors!\\' and she suddenly became an unconscious Trilby\\nof marble, who could produce wonderful sounds--just the sounds he\\nwanted, and nothing else--and think his thoughts and wish his\\nwishes--and love him at his bidding with a strange unreal factitious\\nlove ... just his own love for himself turned inside out--à\\nl\\'envers--and reflected back on him, as from a mirror ... un écho, un\\nsimulacre, quoi! pas autre chose!...
