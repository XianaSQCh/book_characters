      "\n",
      "At sunset hour the forest was still, lonely, sweet with tang of fir and\n",
      "spruce, blazing in gold and red and green; and the man who glided on\n",
      "under the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and, disappearing,\n",
      "to have become a part of the wild woodland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Baldy, highest of the White Mountains, stood up round and bare,\n",
      "rimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun. Then, as the\n",
      "fire dropped behind the domed peak, a change, a cold and darkening\n",
      "blight, passed down the black spear-pointed slopes over all that\n",
      "mountain world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a wild, richly timbered, and abundantly watered region of dark\n",
      "forests and grassy parks, ten thousand feet above sea-level, isolated\n",
      "on all sides by the southern Arizona desert--the virgin home of elk and\n",
      "deer, of bear and lion, of wolf and fox, and the birthplace as well as\n",
      "the hiding-place of the fierce Apache.\n",
      "\n",
      "September in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze\n",
      "following shortly after sundown. Twilight appeared to come on its wings,\n",
      "as did faint sounds, not distinguishable before in the stillness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milt Dale, man of the forest, halted at the edge of a timbered ridge, to\n",
      "listen and to watch. Beneath him lay a narrow valley, open and grassy,\n",
      "from which rose a faint murmur of running water. Its music was pierced\n",
      "by the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote. From overhead in the\n",
      "giant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the\n",
      "night; and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild\n",
      "turkeys going to roost.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Dale's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been,\n",
      "betokening an unchanged serenity of forestland. He was glad, for he had\n",
      "expected to hear the clipclop of white men's horses--which to hear up\n",
      "in those fastnesses was hateful to him. He and the Indian were friends.\n",
      "That fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter. But there hid\n",
      "somewhere in the forest a gang of bad men, sheep-thieves, whom Dale did\n",
      "not want to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he started out upon the slope, a sudden flaring of the afterglow of\n",
      "sunset flooded down from Old Baldy, filling the valley with lights and\n",
      "shadows, yellow and blue, like the radiance of the sky. The pools in the\n",
      "curves of the brook shone darkly bright. Dale's gaze swept up and down\n",
      "the valley, and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook\n",
      "where the wall of spruce stood up, its speared and spiked crest against\n",
      "the pale clouds. The wind began to moan in the trees and there was a\n",
      "feeling of rain in the air. Dale, striking a trail, turned his back to\n",
      "the fading afterglow and strode down the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "With night at hand and a rain-storm brewing, he did not head for his\n",
      "own camp, some miles distant, but directed his steps toward an old log\n",
      "cabin. When he reached it darkness had almost set in. He approached with\n",
      "caution. This cabin, like the few others scattered in the valleys, might\n",
      "harbor Indians or a bear or a panther. Nothing, however, appeared to be\n",
      "there. Then Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky, and he felt\n",
      "the cool dampness of a fine, misty rain on his face. It would rain off\n",
      "and on during the night. Whereupon he entered the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the next moment he heard quick hoof-beats of trotting horses.\n",
      "Peering out, he saw dim, moving forms in the darkness, quite close\n",
      "at hand. They had approached against the wind so that sound had been\n",
      "deadened. Five horses with riders, Dale made out--saw them loom close.\n",
      "Then he heard rough voices. Quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a\n",
      "ladder he knew led to a loft; and finding it, he quickly mounted, taking\n",
      "care not to make a noise with his rifle, and lay down upon the floor\n",
      "of brush and poles. Scarcely had he done so when heavy steps, with\n",
      "accompaniment of clinking spurs, passed through the door below into the\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Beasley, are you here?” queried a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no reply. The man below growled under his breath, and again\n",
      "the spurs jingled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fellars, Beasley ain't here yet,” he called. “Put the hosses under the\n",
      "shed. We'll wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait, huh!” came a harsh reply. “Mebbe all night--an' we got nuthin' to\n",
      "eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up, Moze. Reckon you're no good for anythin' but eatin'. Put them\n",
      "hosses away an' some of you rustle fire-wood in here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Low, muttered curses, then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain\n",
      "of leather and heaves of tired horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another shuffling, clinking footstep entered the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, it'd been sense to fetch a pack along,” drawled this newcomer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon so, Jim. But we didn't, an' what's the use hollerin'? Beasley\n",
      "won't keep us waitin' long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, lying still and prone, felt a slow start in all his blood--a\n",
      "thrilling wave. That deep-voiced man below was Snake Anson, the worst\n",
      "and most dangerous character of the region; and the others, undoubtedly,\n",
      "composed his gang, long notorious in that sparsely settled country.\n",
      "And the Beasley mentioned--he was one of the two biggest ranchers and\n",
      "sheep-raisers of the White Mountain ranges. What was the meaning of\n",
      "a rendezvous between Snake Anson and Beasley? Milt Dale answered that\n",
      "question to Beasley's discredit; and many strange matters pertaining to\n",
      "sheep and herders, always a mystery to the little village of Pine, now\n",
      "became as clear as daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other men entered the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't a-goin' to rain much,” said one. Then came a crash of wood\n",
      "thrown to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, hyar's a chunk of pine log, dry as punk,” said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rustlings and slow footsteps, and then heavy thuds attested to the\n",
      "probability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to\n",
      "split off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, lemme your pipe, an' I'll hev a fire in a jiffy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I want my terbacco an' I ain't carin' about no fire,” replied\n",
      "Snake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you're the meanest cuss in these woods,” drawled Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharp click of steel on flint--many times--and then a sound of hard\n",
      "blowing and sputtering told of Jim's efforts to start a fire. Presently\n",
      "the pitchy blackness of the cabin changed; there came a little crackling\n",
      "of wood and the rustle of flame, and then a steady growing roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it chanced, Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft, and right\n",
      "near his eyes there were cracks between the boughs. When the fire blazed\n",
      "up he was fairly well able to see the men below. The only one he had\n",
      "ever seen was Jim Wilson, who had been well known at Pine before Snake\n",
      "Anson had ever been heard of. Jim was the best of a bad lot, and he had\n",
      "friends among the honest people. It was rumored that he and Snake did\n",
      "not pull well together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fire feels good,” said the burly Moze, who appeared as broad as he was\n",
      "black-visaged. “Fall's sure a-comin'... Now if only we had some grub!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Moze, there's a hunk of deer meat in my saddle-bag, an' if you git it\n",
      "you can have half,” spoke up another voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze shuffled out with alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the firelight Snake Anson's face looked lean and serpent-like, his\n",
      "eyes glittered, and his long neck and all of his long length carried out\n",
      "the analogy of his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, what's this here deal with Beasley?” inquired Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you'll l'arn when I do,” replied the leader. He appeared tired\n",
      "and thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herders--for\n",
      "nothin'?” queried the youngest of the gang, a boy in years, whose hard,\n",
      "bitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're dead right, Burt--an' that's my stand,” replied the man who\n",
      "had sent Moze out. “Snake, snow 'll be flyin' round these woods before\n",
      "long,” said Jim Wilson. “Are we goin' to winter down in the Tonto Basin\n",
      "or over on the Gila?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon we'll do some tall ridin' before we strike south,” replied\n",
      "Snake, gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the juncture Moze returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, I heerd a hoss comin' up the trail,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake rose and stood at the door, listening. Outside the wind moaned\n",
      "fitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” exclaimed Snake, in relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence ensued then for a moment, at the end of which interval Dale\n",
      "heard a rapid clip-clop on the rocky trail outside. The men below\n",
      "shuffled uneasily, but none of them spoke. The fire cracked cheerily.\n",
      "Snake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that\n",
      "expressed both doubt and caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trotting horse had halted out there somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ho there, inside!” called a voice from the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ho yourself!” replied Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you, Snake?” quickly followed the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon so,” returned Anson, showing himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newcomer entered. He was a large man, wearing a slicker that shone\n",
      "wet in the firelight. His sombrero, pulled well down, shadowed his face,\n",
      "so that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked.\n",
      "He had a black, drooping mustache, and a chin like a rock. A potential\n",
      "force, matured and powerful, seemed to be wrapped in his movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, Snake! Hullo, Wilson!” he said. “I've backed out on the other\n",
      "deal. Sent for you on--on another little matter... particular private.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he indicated with a significant gesture that Snake's men were to\n",
      "leave the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! ejaculated Anson, dubiously. Then he turned abruptly. Moze,\n",
      "you an' Shady an' Burt go wait outside. Reckon this ain't the deal I\n",
      "expected.... An' you can saddle the hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three members of the gang filed out, all glancing keenly at the\n",
      "stranger, who had moved back into the shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right now, Beasley,” said Anson, low-voiced. “What's your game?\n",
      "Jim, here, is in on my deals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beasley came forward to the fire, stretching his hands to the\n",
      "blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothin' to do with sheep,” replied he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckoned not,” assented the other. “An' say--whatever your game\n",
      "is, I ain't likin' the way you kept me waitin' an' ridin' around. We\n",
      "waited near all day at Big Spring. Then thet greaser rode up an' sent us\n",
      "here. We're a long way from camp with no grub an' no blankets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't keep you long,” said Beasley. “But even if I did you'd not\n",
      "mind--when I tell you this deal concerns Al Auchincloss--the man who\n",
      "made an outlaw of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame. Wilson,\n",
      "likewise, bent forward eagerly. Beasley glanced at the door--then began\n",
      "to whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Auchincloss is on his last legs. He's goin' to croak. He's sent\n",
      "back to Missouri for a niece--a young girl--an' he means to leave his\n",
      "ranches an' sheep--all his stock to her. Seems he has no one else....\n",
      "Them ranches--an' all them sheep an' hosses! You know me an' Al were\n",
      "pardners in sheep-raisin' for years. He swore I cheated him an' he threw\n",
      "me out. An' all these years I've been swearin' he did me dirt--owed me\n",
      "sheep an' money. I've got as many friends in Pine--an' all the way down\n",
      "the trail--as Auchincloss has.... An' Snake, see here--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the\n",
      "blaze. Anson leaned forward, like a serpent ready to strike, and Jim\n",
      "Wilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here,” panted Beasley. “The girl's due to arrive at Magdalena on\n",
      "the sixteenth. That's a week from to-morrow. She'll take the stage to\n",
      "Snowdrop, where some of Auchincloss's men will meet her with a team.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” grunted Anson as Beasley halted again. “An' what of all thet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She mustn't never get as far as Snowdrop!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You want me to hold up the stage--an' get the girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal--an' what then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make off with her.... She disappears. That's your affair. ... I'll\n",
      "press my claims on Auchincloss--hound him--an' be ready when he croaks\n",
      "to take over his property. Then the girl can come back, for all I\n",
      "care.... You an' Wilson fix up the deal between you. If you have to let\n",
      "the gang in on it don't give them any hunch as to who an' what. This 'll\n",
      "make you a rich stake. An' providin', when it's paid, you strike for new\n",
      "territory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet might be wise,” muttered Snake Anson. “Beasley, the weak point in\n",
      "your game is the uncertainty of life. Old Al is tough. He may fool you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Auchincloss is a dyin' man,” declared Beasley, with such positiveness\n",
      "that it could not be doubted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, he sure wasn't plumb hearty when I last seen him.... Beasley, in\n",
      "case I play your game--how'm I to know that girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her name's Helen Rayner,” replied Beasley, eagerly. “She's twenty\n",
      "years old. All of them Auchinclosses was handsome an' they say she's the\n",
      "handsomest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!... Beasley, this 's sure a bigger deal--an' one I ain't\n",
      "fancyin'.... But I never doubted your word.... Come on--an' talk out.\n",
      "What's in it for me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't let any one in on this. You two can hold up the stage. Why, it\n",
      "was never held up.... But you want to mask.... How about ten thousand\n",
      "sheep--or what they bring at Phenix in gold?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson whistled low.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' leave for new territory?” repeated Snake Anson, under his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You've said it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I ain't fancyin' the girl end of this deal, but you can count on\n",
      "me.... September sixteenth at Magdalena--an' her name's Helen--an' she's\n",
      "handsome?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. My herders will begin drivin' south in about two weeks. Later, if\n",
      "the weather holds good, send me word by one of them an' I'll meet you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze, pulled on his gloves\n",
      "and pulled down his sombrero, and with an abrupt word of parting strode\n",
      "out into the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, what do you make of him?” queried Snake Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pard, he's got us beat two ways for Sunday,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!... Wal, let's get back to camp.” And he led the way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low voices drifted into the cabin, then came snorts of horses and\n",
      "striking hoofs, and after that a steady trot, gradually ceasing.\n",
      "Once more the moan of wind and soft patter of rain filled the forest\n",
      "stillness.\n",

      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "\n",
      "Milt Dale quietly sat up to gaze, with thoughtful eyes, into the gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was thirty years old. As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his\n",
      "school and home in Iowa and, joining a wagon-train of pioneers, he was\n",
      "one of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the White\n",
      "Mountains. But he had not taken kindly to farming or sheep-raising or\n",
      "monotonous home toil, and for twelve years he had lived in the forest,\n",
      "with only infrequent visits to Pine and Show Down and Snowdrop. This\n",
      "wandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for\n",
      "the villagers, for he did care, and he was welcome everywhere, but\n",
      "that he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive\n",
      "instinctive force of a savage.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one\n",
      "of all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That man Beasley!” he soliloquized. “Beasley--in cahoots with Snake\n",
      "Anson!... Well, he was right. Al Auchincloss is on his last legs. Poor\n",
      "old man! When I tell him he'll never believe ME, that's sure!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Discovery of the plot meant to Dale that he must hurry down to Pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A girl--Helen Rayner--twenty years old,” he mused. “Beasley wants her\n",
      "made off with.... That means--worse than killed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired\n",
      "by one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore. Bad men worked\n",
      "their evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer. He had shot wolves for\n",
      "that trick. With men, good or bad, he had not clashed. Old women and\n",
      "children appealed to him, but he had never had any interest in girls.\n",
      "The image, then, of this Helen Rayner came strangely to Dale; and he\n",
      "suddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent Beasley, not\n",
      "to befriend old Al Auchincloss, but for the sake of the girl. Probably\n",
      "she was already on her way West, alone, eager, hopeful of a future home.\n",
      "How little people guessed what awaited them at a journey's end! Many\n",
      "trails ended abruptly in the forest--and only trained woodsmen could\n",
      "read the tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strange how I cut across country to-day from Spruce Swamp,” reflected\n",
      "Dale. Circumstances, movements, usually were not strange to him. His\n",
      "methods and habits were seldom changed by chance. The matter, then, of\n",
      "his turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason, and\n",
      "of his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl, was\n",
      "indeed an adventure to provoke thought. It provoked more, for Dale grew\n",
      "conscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins. He who had\n",
      "little to do with the strife of men, and nothing to do with anger, felt\n",
      "his blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Al won't listen to me,” pondered Dale. “An' even if he did, he\n",
      "wouldn't believe me. Maybe nobody will.... All the same, Snake Anson\n",
      "won't get that girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position, and\n",
      "his pondering ceased. Taking his rifle, he descended from the loft and\n",
      "peered out of the door. The night had grown darker, windier, cooler;\n",
      "broken clouds were scudding across the sky; only a few stars showed;\n",
      "fine rain was blowing from the northwest; and the forest seemed full of\n",
      "a low, dull roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I'd better hang up here,” he said, and turned to the fire. The\n",
      "coals were red now. From the depths of his hunting-coat he procured a\n",
      "little bag of salt and some strips of dried meat. These strips he laid\n",
      "for a moment on the hot embers, until they began to sizzle and curl;\n",
      "then with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter\n",
      "grateful for little.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of\n",
      "the fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing, glowing, golden embers.\n",
      "Outside, the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased\n",
      "to a roar. Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him, drowsily\n",
      "lulling; and he heard the storm-wind in the trees, now like a waterfall,\n",
      "and anon like a retreating army, and again low and sad; and he saw\n",
      "pictures in the glowing embers, strange as dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he rose and, climbing to the loft, he stretched himself out,\n",
      "and soon fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gray dawn broke he was on his way, 'cross-country, to the\n",
      "village of Pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased. A\n",
      "suspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places. All was gray--the\n",
      "parks, the glades--and deeper, darker gray marked the aisles of the\n",
      "forest. Shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent\n",
      "with spectral forms. Then the east kindled, the gray lightened, the\n",
      "dreaming woodland awoke to the far-reaching rays of a bursting red sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was always the happiest moment of Dale's lonely days, as sunset\n",
      "was his saddest. He responded, and there was something in his blood that\n",
      "answered the whistle of a stag from a near-by ridge. His strides were\n",
      "long, noiseless, and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the\n",
      "dew-laden grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest\n",
      "climbing, but the “senacas”--those parklike meadows so named by Mexican\n",
      "sheep-herders--were as round and level as if they had been made by man\n",
      "in beautiful contrast to the dark-green, rough, and rugged ridges. Both\n",
      "open senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance\n",
      "of game. The cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the\n",
      "spruces, a round black lumbering object, a twittering in the brush,\n",
      "and stealthy steps, were all easy signs for Dale to read. Once, as he\n",
      "noiselessly emerged into a little glade, he espied a red fox stalking\n",
      "some quarry, which, as he advanced, proved to be a flock of partridges.\n",
      "They whirred up, brushing the branches, and the fox trotted away. In\n",
      "every senaca Dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the\n",
      "high grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had always been his custom, on his visits to Pine, to kill and\n",
      "pack fresh meat down to several old friends, who were glad to give him\n",
      "lodging. And, hurried though he was now, he did not intend to make an\n",
      "exception of this trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length he got down into the pine belt, where the great, gnarled,\n",
      "yellow trees soared aloft, stately, and aloof from one another, and the\n",
      "ground was a brown, odorous, springy mat of pine-needles, level as a\n",
      "floor. Squirrels watched him from all around, scurrying away at his\n",
      "near approach--tiny, brown, light-striped squirrels, and larger ones,\n",
      "russet-colored, and the splendid dark-grays with their white bushy tails\n",
      "and plumed ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "This belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide, gray, rolling, open land,\n",
      "almost like a prairie, with foot-hills lifting near and far, and the\n",
      "red-gold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun. Here Dale\n",
      "flushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their\n",
      "subdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build,\n",
      "showed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock. They began\n",
      "to run pell-mell out into the grass, until only their heads appeared\n",
      "bobbing along, and finally disappeared. Dale caught a glimpse of\n",
      "skulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys, and as\n",
      "they saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the\n",
      "hindmost. His bullet struck low, as he had meant it to, but too low, and\n",
      "the coyote got only a dusting of earth and pine-needles thrown up into\n",
      "his face. This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt\n",
      "into a tree, rolled over, gained his feet, and then the cover of the\n",
      "forest. Dale was amused at this. His hand was against all the predatory\n",
      "beasts of the forest, though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf\n",
      "and fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the\n",
      "gentle, beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed. But some he\n",
      "loved better than others, and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He crossed the wide, grassy plain and struck another gradual descent\n",
      "where aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm, sun-lighted\n",
      "glades bordered along a sparkling brook. Here he heard a turkey gobble,\n",
      "and that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching,\n",
      "silent detour around a clump of aspens. In a sunny patch of grass\n",
      "a dozen or more big gobblers stood, all suspiciously facing in his\n",
      "direction, heads erect, with that wild aspect peculiar to their species.\n",
      "Old wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk. Dale\n",
      "shot two of them. The others began to run like ostriches, thudding over\n",
      "the ground, spreading their wings, and with that running start launched\n",
      "their heavy bodies into whirring flight. They flew low, at about the\n",
      "height of a man from the grass, and vanished in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way. Soon\n",
      "he came to a break in the forest level, from which he gazed down a\n",
      "league-long slope of pine and cedar, out upon the bare, glistening\n",
      "desert, stretching away, endlessly rolling out to the dim, dark horizon\n",
      "line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered\n",
      "forest. A road, running parallel with a dark-watered, swift-flowing\n",
      "stream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue\n",
      "smoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow\n",
      "in the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted\n",
      "with horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site\n",
      "appeared to be a natural clearing, for there was no evidence of cut\n",
      "timber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene,\n",
      "tranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and\n",
      "happy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden\n",
      "bordered with sunflowers. His call was answered by an old woman, gray\n",
      "and bent, but remarkably spry, who appeared at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, land's sakes, if it ain't Milt Dale!” she exclaimed, in welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon it's me, Mrs. Cass,” he replied. “An' I've brought you a\n",
      "turkey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, you're that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass.... What\n",
      "a gobbler! First one I've seen this fall. My man Tom used to fetch home\n",
      "gobblers like that.... An' mebbe he'll come home again sometime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband, Tom Cass, had gone into the forest years before and had\n",
      "never returned. But the old woman always looked for him and never gave\n",
      "up hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back,” replied Dale, as\n",
      "he had said to her many a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come right in. You air hungry, I know. Now, son, when last did you eat\n",
      "a fresh egg or a flapjack?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should remember,” he answered, laughing, as he followed her into a\n",
      "small, clean kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laws-a'-me! An' thet's months ago,” she replied, shaking her gray head.\n",
      "“Milt, you should give up that wild life--an' marry--an' have a home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You always tell me that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, an' I'll see you do it yet.... Now you set there, an' pretty soon\n",
      "I'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's the news, Auntie?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nary news in this dead place. Why, nobody's been to Snowdrop in two\n",
      "weeks!... Sary Jones died, poor old soul--she's better off--an' one of\n",
      "my cows run away. Milt, she's wild when she gits loose in the woods.\n",
      "An' you'll have to track her, 'cause nobody else can. An' John Dakker's\n",
      "heifer was killed by a lion, an' Lem Harden's fast hoss--you know his\n",
      "favorite--was stole by hoss-thieves. Lem is jest crazy. An' that reminds\n",
      "me, Milt, where's your big ranger, thet you'd never sell or lend?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My horses are up in the woods, Auntie; safe, I reckon, from\n",
      "horse-thieves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, that's a blessin'. We've had some stock stole this summer, Milt,\n",
      "an' no mistake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, while preparing a meal for Dale, the old woman went on recounting\n",
      "all that had happened in the little village since his last visit. Dale\n",
      "enjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy, and it was exceedingly good\n",
      "to sit at her table. In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been\n",
      "such butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple\n",
      "pie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of\n",
      "Dale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How's old Al Auchincloss?” presently inquired Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poorly--poorly,” sighed Mrs. Cass. “But he tramps an' rides around\n",
      "same as ever. Al's not long for this world.... An', Milt, that reminds\n",
      "me--there's the biggest news you ever heard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don't say so!” exclaimed Dale, to encourage the excited old woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece, Helen Rayner. She's to\n",
      "inherit all his property. We've heard much of her--a purty lass, they\n",
      "say.... Now, Milt Dale, here's your chance. Stay out of the woods an' go\n",
      "to work.... You can marry that girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No chance for me, Auntie,” replied Dale, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman snorted. “Much you know! Any girl would have you, Milt\n",
      "Dale, if you'd only throw a kerchief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me!... An' why, Auntie?” he queried, half amused, half thoughtful. When\n",
      "he got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the\n",
      "ideas of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why? I declare, Milt, you live so in the woods you're like a boy of\n",
      "ten--an' then sometimes as old as the hills.... There's no young man to\n",
      "compare with you, hereabouts. An' this girl--she'll have all the spunk\n",
      "of the Auchinclosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then maybe she'd not be such a catch, after all,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you've no cause to love them, that's sure. But, Milt, the\n",
      "Auchincloss women are always good wives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Auntie, you're dreamin',” said Dale, soberly. “I want no wife. I'm\n",
      "happy in the woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Air you goin' to live like an Injun all your days, Milt Dale?” she\n",
      "queried, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to be ashamed. But some lass will change you, boy, an' mebbe\n",
      "it'll be this Helen Rayner. I hope an' pray so to thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Auntie, supposin' she did change me. She'd never change old Al. He\n",
      "hates me, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I ain't so sure, Milt. I met Al the other day. He inquired for\n",
      "you, an' said you was wild, but he reckoned men like you was good for\n",
      "pioneer settlements. Lord knows the good turns you've done this village!\n",
      "Milt, old Al doesn't approve of your wild life, but he never had no hard\n",
      "feelin's till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Auntie, I don't believe Tom ever killed Al's sheep,” declared Dale,\n",
      "positively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Al thinks so, an' many other people,” replied Mrs. Cass, shaking\n",
      "her gray head doubtfully. “You never swore he didn't. An' there was them\n",
      "two sheep-herders who did swear they seen him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They only saw a cougar. An' they were so scared they ran.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who wouldn't? Thet big beast is enough to scare any one. For land's\n",
      "sakes, don't ever fetch him down here again! I'll never forgit the time\n",
      "you did. All the folks an' children an' hosses in Pine broke an' run\n",
      "thet day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; but Tom wasn't to blame. Auntie, he's the tamest of my pets.\n",
      "Didn't he try to put his head on your lap an' lick your hand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt, I ain't gainsayin' your cougar pet didn't act better 'n a\n",
      "lot of people I know. Fer he did. But the looks of him an' what's been\n",
      "said was enough for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' what's all that, Auntie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say he's wild when out of your sight. An' thet he'd trail an' kill\n",
      "anythin' you put him after.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I trained him to be just that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, leave Tom to home up in the woods--when you visit us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale finished his hearty meal, and listened awhile longer to the old\n",
      "woman's talk; then, taking his rifle and the other turkey, he bade her\n",
      "good-by. She followed him out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Milt, you'll come soon again, won't you--jest to see Al's\n",
      "niece--who'll be here in a week?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I'll drop in some day.... Auntie, have you seen my friends,\n",
      "the Mormon boys?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I 'ain't seen them an' don't want to,” she retorted. “Milt Dale, if\n",
      "any one ever corrals you it'll be Mormons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't worry, Auntie. I like those boys. They often see me up in the\n",
      "woods an' ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh\n",
      "meat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They're workin' for Beasley now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that so?” rejoined Dale, with a sudden start. “An' what doin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley is gettin' so rich he's buildin' a fence, an' didn't have\n",
      "enough help, so I hear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley gettin' rich!” repeated Dale, thoughtfully. “More sheep an'\n",
      "horses an' cattle than ever, I reckon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laws-a'-me! Why, Milt, Beasley 'ain't any idea what he owns. Yes, he's\n",
      "the biggest man in these parts, since poor old Al's took to failin'. I\n",
      "reckon Al's health ain't none improved by Beasley's success. They've bad\n",
      "some bitter quarrels lately--so I hear. Al ain't what he was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale bade good-by again to his old friend and strode away, thoughtful\n",
      "and serious. Beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent, but he\n",
      "would be dangerous to oppose. There did not appear much doubt of his\n",
      "driving his way rough-shod to the dominance of affairs there in Pine.\n",
      "Dale, passing down the road, began to meet acquaintances who had\n",
      "hearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings, so that his\n",
      "pondering was interrupted for the time being. He carried the turkey to\n",
      "another old friend, and when he left her house he went on to the village\n",
      "store. This was a large log cabin, roughly covered with clapboards, with\n",
      "a wide plank platform in front and a hitching-rail in the road. Several\n",
      "horses were standing there, and a group of lazy, shirt-sleeved loungers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be doggoned if it ain't Milt Dale!” exclaimed one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Milt, old buckskin! Right down glad to see you,” greeted\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Dale! You air shore good for sore eyes,” drawled still another.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long period of absence Dale always experienced a singular warmth\n",
      "of feeling when he met these acquaintances. It faded quickly when he got\n",
      "back to the intimacy of his woodland, and that was because the people of\n",
      "Pine, with few exceptions--though they liked him and greatly admired his\n",
      "outdoor wisdom--regarded him as a sort of nonentity. Because he loved\n",
      "the wild and preferred it to village and range life, they had classed\n",
      "him as not one of them. Some believed him lazy; others believed him\n",
      "shiftless; others thought him an Indian in mind and habits; and there\n",
      "were many who called him slow-witted. Then there was another side to\n",
      "their regard for him, which always afforded him good-natured amusement.\n",
      "Two of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison; another\n",
      "wanted to hunt with him. Lem Harden came out of the store and appealed\n",
      "to Dale to recover his stolen horse. Lem's brother wanted a wild-running\n",
      "mare tracked and brought home. Jesse Lyons wanted a colt broken, and\n",
      "broken with patience, not violence, as was the method of the hard-riding\n",
      "boys at Pine. So one and all they besieged Dale with their selfish\n",
      "needs, all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures. And\n",
      "on the moment there happened by two women whose remarks, as they entered\n",
      "the store, bore strong testimony to Dale's personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there ain't Milt Dale!” exclaimed the older of the two. “How lucky!\n",
      "My cow's sick, an' the men are no good doctorin'. I'll jest ask Milt\n",
      "over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one like Milt!” responded the other woman, heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day there--you Milt Dale!” called the first speaker. “When you git\n",
      "away from these lazy men come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale never refused a service, and that was why his infrequent visits to\n",
      "Pine were wont to be prolonged beyond his own pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Beasley strode down the street, and when about to enter the\n",
      "store he espied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo there, Milt!” he called, cordially, as he came forward with\n",
      "extended hand. His greeting was sincere, but the lightning glance he\n",
      "shot over Dale was not born of his pleasure. Seen in daylight, Beasley\n",
      "was a big, bold, bluff man, with strong, dark features. His aggressive\n",
      "presence suggested that he was a good friend and a bad enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook hands with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you, Beasley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain't complainin', Milt, though I got more work than I can rustle.\n",
      "Reckon you wouldn't take a job bossin' my sheep-herders?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I wouldn't,” replied Dale. “Thanks all the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's goin' on up in the woods?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plenty of turkey an' deer. Lots of bear, too. The Indians have worked\n",
      "back on the south side early this fall. But I reckon winter will come\n",
      "late an' be mild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good! An' where 're you headin' from?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Cross-country from my camp,” replied Dale, rather evasively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your camp! Nobody ever found that yet,” declared Beasley, gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's up there,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you've got that cougar chained in your cabin door?” queried\n",
      "Beasley, and there was a barely distinguishable shudder of his muscular\n",
      "frame. Also the pupils dilated in his hard brown eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom ain't chained. An' I haven't no cabin, Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean to tell me that big brute stays in your camp without bein'\n",
      "hog-tied or corralled!” demanded Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure he does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beats me! But, then, I'm queer on cougars. Have had many a cougar trail\n",
      "me at night. Ain't sayin' I was scared. But I don't care for that brand\n",
      "of varmint.... Milt, you goin' to stay down awhile?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'll hang around some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come over to the ranch. Glad to see you any time. Some old huntin'\n",
      "pards of yours are workin' for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks, Beasley. I reckon I'll come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley turned away and took a step, and then, as if with an\n",
      "after-thought, he wheeled again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose you've heard about old Al Auchincloss bein' near petered out?”\n",
      " queried Beasley. A strong, ponderous cast of thought seemed to emanate\n",
      "from his features. Dale divined that Beasley's next step would be to\n",
      "further his advancement by some word or hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Widow Cass was tellin' me all the news. Too bad about old Al,” replied\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure is. He's done for. An' I'm sorry--though Al's never been square--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley,” interrupted Dale, quickly, “you can't say that to me. Al\n",
      "Auchincloss always was the whitest an' squarest man in this sheep\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley gave Dale a fleeting, dark glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, what you think ain't goin' to influence feelin' on this range,”\n",
      " returned Beasley, deliberately. “You live in the woods an'--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon livin' in the woods I might think--an' know a whole lot,”\n",
      " interposed Dale, just as deliberately. The group of men exchanged\n",
      "surprised glances. This was Milt Dale in different aspect. And Beasley\n",
      "did not conceal a puzzled surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About what--now?” he asked, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, about what's goin' on in Pine,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the men laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore lots goin' on--an' no mistake,” put in Lem Harden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the keen Beasley had never before considered Milt Dale as a\n",
      "responsible person; certainly never one in any way to cross his trail.\n",
      "But on the instant, perhaps, some instinct was born, or he divined an\n",
      "antagonism in Dale that was both surprising and perplexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, I've differences with Al Auchincloss--have had them for years,”\n",
      " said Beasley. “Much of what he owns is mine. An' it's goin' to come to\n",
      "me. Now I reckon people will be takin' sides--some for me an' some for\n",
      "Al. Most are for me.... Where do you stand? Al Auchincloss never had no\n",
      "use for you, an' besides he's a dyin' man. Are you goin' on his side?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I reckon I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'm glad you've declared yourself,” rejoined Beasley, shortly,\n",
      "and he strode away with the ponderous gait of a man who would brush any\n",
      "obstacle from his path.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, thet's bad--makin' Beasley sore at you,” said Lem Harden. “He's\n",
      "on the way to boss this outfit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's sure goin' to step into Al's boots,” said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet was white of Milt to stick up fer poor old Al,” declared Lem's\n",
      "brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale broke away from them and wended a thoughtful way down the road. The\n",
      "burden of what he knew about Beasley weighed less heavily upon him, and\n",
      "the close-lipped course he had decided upon appeared wisest. He needed\n",
      "to think before undertaking to call upon old Al Auchincloss; and to that\n",
      "end he sought an hour's seclusion under the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon, Dale, having accomplished some tasks imposed upon him\n",
      "by his old friends at Pine, directed slow steps toward the Auchincloss\n",
      "ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flat, square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon\n",
      "a little hill half a mile out of the village. A home as well as a fort,\n",
      "it had been the first structure erected in that region, and the process\n",
      "of building had more than once been interrupted by Indian attacks.\n",
      "The Apaches had for some time, however, confined their fierce raids to\n",
      "points south of the White Mountain range. Auchincloss's house looked\n",
      "down upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes, and\n",
      "hundreds of acres of well-cultivated soil. Fields of oats waved gray and\n",
      "yellow in the afternoon sun; an immense green pasture was divided by a\n",
      "willow-bordered brook, and here were droves of horses, and out on the\n",
      "rolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of\n",
      "man. The brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the\n",
      "village. Water for the house, however, came down from the high, wooded\n",
      "slope of the mountain, and had been brought there by a simple expedient.\n",
      "Pine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end, with a deep trough\n",
      "cut in them, and they made a shining line down the slope, across the\n",
      "valley, and up the little hill to the Auchincloss home. Near the house\n",
      "the hollowed halves of logs had been bound together, making a crude\n",
      "pipe. Water ran uphill in this case, one of the facts that made the\n",
      "ranch famous, as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small\n",
      "boys of Pine. The two good women who managed Auchincloss's large\n",
      "household were often shocked by the strange things that floated into\n",
      "their kitchen with the ever-flowing stream of clear, cold mountain\n",
      "water.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happened this day Dale encountered Al Auchincloss sitting in the\n",
      "shade of a porch, talking to some of his sheep-herders and stockmen.\n",
      "Auchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width\n",
      "of shoulder. He had no gray hairs, and he did not look old, yet there\n",
      "was in his face a certain weariness, something that resembled sloping\n",
      "lines of distress, dim and pale, that told of age and the ebb-tide of\n",
      "vitality. His features, cast in large mold, were clean-cut and comely,\n",
      "and he had frank blue eyes, somewhat sad, yet still full of spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had no idea how his visit would be taken, and he certainly would\n",
      "not have been surprised to be ordered off the place. He had not set foot\n",
      "there for years. Therefore it was with surprise that he saw Auchincloss\n",
      "wave away the herders and take his entrance without any particular\n",
      "expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Al! How are you?” greeted Dale, easily, as he leaned his rifle\n",
      "against the log wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss did not rise, but he offered his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt Dale, I reckon this is the first time I ever seen you that I\n",
      "couldn't lay you flat on your back,” replied the rancher. His tone was\n",
      "both testy and full of pathos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I take it you mean you ain't very well,” replied Dale. “I'm sorry, Al.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it ain't thet. Never was sick in my life. I'm just played out, like\n",
      "a hoss thet had been strong an' willin', an' did too much.... Wal, you\n",
      "don't look a day older, Milt. Livin' in the woods rolls over a man's\n",
      "head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'm feelin' fine, an' time never bothers me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, mebbe you ain't such a fool, after all. I've wondered\n",
      "lately--since I had time to think.... But, Milt, you don't git no\n",
      "richer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, I have all I want an' need.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, then, you don't support anybody; you don't do any good in the\n",
      "world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don't agree, Al,” replied Dale, with his slow smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon we never did.... An' you jest come over to pay your respects to\n",
      "me, eh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not altogether,” answered Dale, ponderingly. “First off, I'd like to\n",
      "say I'll pay back them sheep you always claimed my tame cougar killed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will! An' how'd you go about that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't very many sheep, was there?\n",
      "\n",
      "“A matter of fifty head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So many! Al, do you still think old Tom killed them sheep?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! Milt, I know damn well he did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, now how could you know somethin' I don't? Be reasonable, now. Let's\n",
      "don't fall out about this again. I'll pay back the sheep. Work it out--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt Dale, you'll come down here an' work out that fifty head of\n",
      "sheep!” ejaculated the old rancher, incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'll be damned!” He sat back and gazed with shrewd eyes at Dale.\n",
      "“What's got into you, Milt? Hev you heard about my niece thet's comin',\n",
      "an' think you'll shine up to her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Al, her comin' has a good deal to do with my deal,” replied Dale,\n",
      "soberly. “But I never thought to shine up to her, as you hint.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! You're just like all the other colts hereabouts. Reckon it's\n",
      "a good sign, too. It'll take a woman to fetch you out of the woods. But,\n",
      "boy, this niece of mine, Helen Rayner, will stand you on your head.\n",
      "I never seen her. They say she's jest like her mother. An' Nell\n",
      "Auchincloss--what a girl she was!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale felt his face grow red. Indeed, this was strange conversation for\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Honest, Al--” he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Son, don't lie to an old man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lie! I wouldn't lie to any one. Al, it's only men who live in towns an'\n",
      "are always makin' deals. I live in the forest, where there's nothin' to\n",
      "make me lie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, no offense meant, I'm sure,” responded Auchincloss. “An' mebbe\n",
      "there's somethin' in what you say... We was talkin' about them sheep\n",
      "your big cat killed. Wal, Milt, I can't prove it, that's sure. An' mebbe\n",
      "you'll think me doddery when I tell you my reason. It wasn't what them\n",
      "greaser herders said about seein' a cougar in the herd.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was it, then?” queried Dale, much interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet day a year ago I seen your pet. He was lyin' in front of the\n",
      "store an' you was inside tradin', fer supplies, I reckon. It was like\n",
      "meetin' an enemy face to face. Because, damn me if I didn't know that\n",
      "cougar was guilty when he looked in my eyes! There!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old rancher expected to be laughed at. But Dale was grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, I know how you felt,” he replied, as if they were discussing an\n",
      "action of a human being. “Sure I'd hate to doubt old Tom. But he's a\n",
      "cougar. An' the ways of animals are strange... Anyway, Al, I'll make\n",
      "good the loss of your sheep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you won't,” rejoined Auchincloss, quickly. “We'll call it off. I'm\n",
      "takin' it square of you to make the offer. Thet's enough. So forget your\n",
      "worry about work, if you had any.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There's somethin' else, Al, I wanted to say,” began Dale, with\n",
      "hesitation. “An' it's about Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss started violently, and a flame of red shot into his face.\n",
      "Then he raised a big hand that shook. Dale saw in a flash how the old\n",
      "man's nerves had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't mention--thet--thet greaser--to me!” burst out the rancher. “It\n",
      "makes me see--red.... Dale, I ain't overlookin' that you spoke up fer\n",
      "me to-day--stood fer my side. Lem Harden told me. I was glad. An' thet's\n",
      "why--to-day--I forgot our old quarrel.... But not a word about thet\n",
      "sheep-thief--or I'll drive you off the place!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Al--be reasonable,” remonstrated Dale. “It's necessary thet I\n",
      "speak of--of Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't. Not to me. I won't listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you'll have to, Al,” returned Dale. “Beasley's after your\n",
      "property. He's made a deal--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By Heaven! I know that!” shouted Auchincloss, tottering up, with his\n",
      "face now black-red. “Do you think thet's new to me? Shut up, Dale! I\n",
      "can't stand it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Al--there's worse,” went on Dale, hurriedly. “Worse! Your life's\n",
      "threatened--an' your niece, Helen--she's to be--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up--an' clear out!” roared Auchincloss, waving his huge fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed on the verge of a collapse as, shaking all over, he backed\n",
      "into the door. A few seconds of rage had transformed him into a pitiful\n",
      "old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Al--I'm your friend--” began Dale, appealingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friend, hey?” returned the rancher, with grim, bitter passion. “Then\n",
      "you're the only one.... Milt Dale, I'm rich an' I'm a dyin' man. I trust\n",
      "nobody... But, you wild hunter--if you're my friend--prove it!... Go\n",
      "kill thet greaser sheep-thief! DO somethin'--an' then come talk to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he lurched, half falling, into the house, and slammed the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood there for a blank moment, and then, taking up his rifle, he\n",
      "strode away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward sunset Dale located the camp of his four Mormon friends, and\n",
      "reached it in time for supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "John, Roy, Joe, and Hal Beeman were sons of a pioneer Mormon who had\n",
      "settled the little community of Snowdrop. They were young men in years,\n",
      "but hard labor and hard life in the open had made them look matured.\n",
      "Only a year's difference in age stood between John and Roy, and between\n",
      "Roy and Joe, and likewise Joe and Hal. When it came to appearance they\n",
      "were difficult to distinguish from one another. Horsemen, sheep-herders,\n",
      "cattle-raisers, hunters--they all possessed long, wiry, powerful frames,\n",
      "lean, bronzed, still faces, and the quiet, keen eyes of men used to the\n",
      "open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their camp was situated beside a spring in a cove surrounded by aspens,\n",
      "some three miles from Pine; and, though working for Beasley, near\n",
      "the village, they had ridden to and fro from camp, after the habit of\n",
      "seclusion peculiar to their kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale and the brothers had much in common, and a warm regard had sprang\n",
      "up. But their exchange of confidences had wholly concerned things\n",
      "pertaining to the forest. Dale ate supper with them, and talked as usual\n",
      "when he met them, without giving any hint of the purpose forming in his\n",
      "mind. After the meal he helped Joe round up the horses, hobble them for\n",
      "the night, and drive them into a grassy glade among the pines. Later,\n",
      "when the shadows stole through the forest on the cool wind, and the\n",
      "camp-fire glowed comfortably, Dale broached the subject that possessed\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' so you're working for Beasley?” he queried, by way of starting\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We was,” drawled John. “But to-day, bein' the end of our month, we got\n",
      "our pay an' quit. Beasley sure was sore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why'd you knock off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "John essayed no reply, and his brothers all had that quiet, suppressed\n",
      "look of knowledge under restraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen to what I come to tell you, then you'll talk,” went on Dale. And\n",
      "hurriedly he told of Beasley's plot to abduct Al Auchincloss's niece and\n",
      "claim the dying man's property.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Dale ended, rather breathlessly, the Mormon boys sat without any\n",
      "show of surprise or feeling. John, the eldest, took up a stick and\n",
      "slowly poked the red embers of the fire, making the white sparks fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Milt, why'd you tell us thet?” he asked, guardedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're the only friends I've got,” replied Dale. “It didn't seem safe\n",
      "for me to talk down in the village. I thought of you boys right off. I\n",
      "ain't goin' to let Snake Anson get that girl. An' I need help, so I come\n",
      "to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley's strong around Pine, an' old Al's weakenin'. Beasley will git\n",
      "the property, girl or no girl,” said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Things don't always turn out as they look. But no matter about that.\n",
      "The girl deal is what riled me.... She's to arrive at Magdalena on\n",
      "the sixteenth, an' take stage for Snowdrop.... Now what to do? If she\n",
      "travels on that stage I'll be on it, you bet. But she oughtn't to be in\n",
      "it at all. ... Boys, somehow I'm goin' to save her. Will you help me? I\n",
      "reckon I've been in some tight corners for you. Sure, this 's different.\n",
      "But are you my friends? You know now what Beasley is. An' you're all\n",
      "lost at the hands of Snake Anson's gang. You've got fast hosses, eyes\n",
      "for trackin', an' you can handle a rifle. You're the kind of fellows I'd\n",
      "want in a tight pinch with a bad gang. Will you stand by me or see me go\n",
      "alone?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then John Beeman, silently, and with pale face, gave Dale's hand a\n",
      "powerful grip, and one by one the other brothers rose to do likewise.\n",
      "Their eyes flashed with hard glint and a strange bitterness hovered\n",
      "around their thin lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, mebbe we know what Beasley is better 'n you,” said John, at\n",
      "length. “He ruined my father. He's cheated other Mormons. We boys have\n",
      "proved to ourselves thet he gets the sheep Anson's gang steals.... An'\n",
      "drives the herds to Phenix! Our people won't let us accuse Beasley. So\n",
      "we've suffered in silence. My father always said, let some one else say\n",
      "the first word against Beasley, an' you've come to us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Beeman put a hand on Dale's shoulder. He, perhaps, was the keenest\n",
      "of the brothers and the one to whom adventure and peril called most.\n",
      "He had been oftenest with Dale, on many a long trail, and he was the\n",
      "hardest rider and the most relentless tracker in all that range country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' we're goin' with you,” he said, in a strong and rolling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "They resumed their seats before the fire. John threw on more wood, and\n",
      "with a crackling and sparkling the blaze curled up, fanned by the wind.\n",
      "As twilight deepened into night the moan in the pines increased to a\n",
      "roar. A pack of coyotes commenced to pierce the air in staccato cries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five young men conversed long and earnestly, considering, planning,\n",
      "rejecting ideas advanced by each. Dale and Roy Beeman suggested most of\n",
      "what became acceptable to all. Hunters of their type resembled explorers\n",
      "in slow and deliberate attention to details. What they had to deal with\n",
      "here was a situation of unlimited possibilities; the horses and outfit\n",
      "needed; a long detour to reach Magdalena unobserved; the rescue of a\n",
      "strange girl who would no doubt be self-willed and determined to ride\n",
      "on the stage--the rescue forcible, if necessary; the fight and the\n",
      "inevitable pursuit; the flight into the forest, and the safe delivery of\n",
      "the girl to Auchincloss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, Milt, will we go after Beasley?” queried Roy Beeman,\n",
      "significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale was silent and thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sufficient unto the day!” said John. “An' fellars, let's go to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rolled out their tarpaulins, Dale sharing Roy's blankets, and soon\n",
      "were asleep, while the red embers slowly faded, and the great roar of\n",
      "wind died down, and the forest stillness set in.\n",

      "CHAPTER IV\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twenty-four\n",
      "hours before she made an alarming discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accompanied by her sister Bo, a precocious girl of sixteen, Helen had\n",
      "left St. Joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at\n",
      "home, yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life\n",
      "in the Far West. All her people had the pioneer spirit; love of change,\n",
      "action, adventure, was in her blood. Then duty to a widowed mother\n",
      "with a large and growing family had called to Helen to accept this rich\n",
      "uncle's offer. She had taught school and also her little brothers and\n",
      "sisters; she had helped along in other ways. And now, though the\n",
      "tearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard, this opportunity was\n",
      "irresistible in its call. The prayer of her dreams had been answered. To\n",
      "bring good fortune to her family; to take care of this beautiful, wild\n",
      "little sister; to leave the yellow, sordid, humdrum towns for the great,\n",
      "rolling, boundless open; to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day\n",
      "to be her own; to have fulfilled a deep, instinctive, and undeveloped\n",
      "love of horses, cattle, sheep, of desert and mountain, of trees and\n",
      "brooks and wild flowers--all this was the sum of her most passionate\n",
      "longings, now in some marvelous, fairylike way to come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "A check to her happy anticipations, a blank, sickening dash of cold\n",
      "water upon her warm and intimate dreams, had been the discovery\n",
      "that Harve Riggs was on the train. His presence could mean only one\n",
      "thing--that he had followed her. Riggs had been the worst of many\n",
      "sore trials back there in St. Joseph. He had possessed some claim or\n",
      "influence upon her mother, who favored his offer of marriage to Helen;\n",
      "he was neither attractive, nor good, nor industrious, nor anything that\n",
      "interested her; he was the boastful, strutting adventurer, not genuinely\n",
      "Western, and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety. Helen had\n",
      "suspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his,\n",
      "and also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be bad--as\n",
      "Western men were bad. But on the train, in the station at La Junta, one\n",
      "glimpse of him, manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of\n",
      "her sight, warned Helen that she now might have a problem on her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recognition sobered her. All was not to be a road of roses to this\n",
      "new home in the West. Riggs would follow her, if he could not accompany\n",
      "her, and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything. Helen felt the\n",
      "startling realization of being cast upon her own resources, and then\n",
      "a numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness. But these\n",
      "feelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her\n",
      "temper. Opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to\n",
      "it. She would not have been Al Auchincloss's niece if she had faltered.\n",
      "And, when temper was succeeded by genuine anger, she could have laughed\n",
      "to scorn this Harve Riggs and his schemes, whatever they were. Once\n",
      "and for all she dismissed fear of him. When she left St. Joseph she had\n",
      "faced the West with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of\n",
      "that West. Homes had to be made out there in that far country, so Uncle\n",
      "Al had written, and women were needed to make homes. She meant to be one\n",
      "of these women and to make of her sister another. And with the thought\n",
      "that she would know definitely what to say to Riggs when he approached\n",
      "her, sooner or later, Helen dismissed him from mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the train was in motion, enabling Helen to watch the ever-changing\n",
      "scenery, and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping Bo well in\n",
      "hand at stations, she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests\n",
      "and the red, rocky gullies and the dim, bold mountains. She saw the sun\n",
      "set over distant ranges of New Mexico--a golden blaze of glory, as new\n",
      "to her as the strange fancies born in her, thrilling and fleeting by.\n",
      "Bo's raptures were not silent, and the instant the sun sank and the\n",
      "color faded she just as rapturously importuned Helen to get out the huge\n",
      "basket of food they had brought from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had two seats, facing each other, at the end of the coach, and\n",
      "piled there, with the basket on top, was luggage that constituted all\n",
      "the girls owned in the world. Indeed, it was very much more than they\n",
      "had ever owned before, because their mother, in her care for them and\n",
      "desire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle, had spent\n",
      "money and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls sat together, with the heavy basket on their knees, and ate\n",
      "while they gazed out at the cool, dark ridges. The train clattered\n",
      "slowly on, apparently over a road that was all curves. And it was\n",
      "supper-time for everybody in that crowded coach. If Helen had not been\n",
      "so absorbed by the great, wild mountain-land she would have had more\n",
      "interest in the passengers. As it was she saw them, and was amused\n",
      "and thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car, all\n",
      "middle-class people, poor and hopeful, traveling out there to the New\n",
      "West to find homes. It was splendid and beautiful, this fact, yet it\n",
      "inspired a brief and inexplicable sadness. From the train window, that\n",
      "world of forest and crag, with its long bare reaches between, seemed so\n",
      "lonely, so wild, so unlivable. How endless the distance! For hours and\n",
      "miles upon miles no house, no hut, no Indian tepee! It was amazing, the\n",
      "length and breadth of this beautiful land. And Helen, who loved brooks\n",
      "and running streams, saw no water at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then darkness settled down over the slow-moving panorama; a cool night\n",
      "wind blew in at the window; white stars began to blink out of the blue.\n",
      "The sisters, with hands clasped and heads nestled together, went to\n",
      "sleep under a heavy cloak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Early the next morning, while the girls were again delving into their\n",
      "apparently bottomless basket, the train stopped at Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! Look!” cried Bo, in thrilling voice. “Cowboys! Oh, Nell, look!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen, laughing, looked first at her sister, and thought how most of all\n",
      "she was good to look at. Bo was little, instinct with pulsating life,\n",
      "and she had chestnut hair and dark-blue eyes. These eyes were flashing,\n",
      "roguish, and they drew like magnets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside on the rude station platform were railroad men, Mexicans, and\n",
      "a group of lounging cowboys. Long, lean, bow-legged fellows they were,\n",
      "with young, frank faces and intent eyes. One of them seemed particularly\n",
      "attractive with his superb build, his red-bronze face and bright-red\n",
      "scarf, his swinging gun, and the huge, long, curved spurs. Evidently\n",
      "he caught Bo's admiring gaze, for, with a word to his companions, he\n",
      "sauntered toward the window where the girls sat. His gait was singular,\n",
      "almost awkward, as if he was not accustomed to walking. The long spurs\n",
      "jingled musically. He removed his sombrero and stood at ease, frank,\n",
      "cool, smiling. Helen liked him on sight, and, looking to see what effect\n",
      "he had upon Bo, she found that young lady staring, frightened stiff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good mawnin',” drawled the cowboy, with slow, good-humored smile. “Now\n",
      "where might you-all be travelin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of his voice, the clean-cut and droll geniality; seemed new\n",
      "and delightful to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We go to Magdalena--then take stage for the White Mountains,” replied\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy's still, intent eyes showed surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Apache country, miss,” he said. “I reckon I'm sorry. Thet's shore no\n",
      "place for you-all... Beggin' your pawdin--you ain't Mormons?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. We're nieces of Al Auchincloss,” rejoined Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you don't say! I've been down Magdalena way an' heerd of Al....\n",
      "Reckon you're goin' a-visitin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's to be home for us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore thet's fine. The West needs girls.... Yes, I've heerd of Al.\n",
      "An old Arizona cattle-man in a sheep country! Thet's bad.... Now I'm\n",
      "wonderin'--if I'd drift down there an' ask him for a job ridin' for\n",
      "him--would I get it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal\n",
      "water. The gaze he bent upon Bo somehow pleased Helen. The last year or\n",
      "two, since Bo had grown prettier all the time, she had been a magnet for\n",
      "admiring glances. This one of the cowboy's inspired respect and liking,\n",
      "as well as amusement. It certainly was not lost upon Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My uncle once said in a letter that he never had enough men to run his\n",
      "ranch,” replied Helen, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'll go. I reckon I'd jest naturally drift that way--now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed so laconic, so easy, so nice, that he could not have been\n",
      "taken seriously, yet Helen's quick perceptions registered a daring, a\n",
      "something that was both sudden and inevitable in him. His last word was\n",
      "as clear as the soft look he fixed upon Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had a mischievous trait, which, subdue it as she would,\n",
      "occasionally cropped out; and Bo, who once in her wilful life had been\n",
      "rendered speechless, offered such a temptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe my little sister will put in a good word for you--to Uncle Al,”\n",
      " said Helen. Just then the train jerked, and started slowly. The cowboy\n",
      "took two long strides beside the car, his heated boyish face almost on a\n",
      "level with the window, his eyes, now shy and a little wistful, yet bold,\n",
      "too, fixed upon Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-by--Sweetheart!” he called.\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted--was lost to view.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” ejaculated Helen, contritely, half sorry, half amused. “What a\n",
      "sudden young gentleman!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had blushed beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, wasn't he glorious!” she burst out, with eyes shining.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd hardly call him that, but he was--nice,” replied Helen, much\n",
      "relieved that Bo had apparently not taken offense at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared plain that Bo resisted a frantic desire to look out of the\n",
      "window and to wave her hand. But she only peeped out, manifestly to her\n",
      "disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think he--he'll come to Uncle Al's?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Child, he was only in fun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll bet you he comes. Oh, it'd be great! I'm going to love\n",
      "cowboys. They don't look like that Harve Riggs who ran after you so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen sighed, partly because of the reminder of her odious suitor, and\n",
      "partly because Bo's future already called mysteriously to the child.\n",
      "Helen had to be at once a mother and a protector to a girl of intense\n",
      "and wilful spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the trainmen directed the girls' attention to a green, sloping\n",
      "mountain rising to a bold, blunt bluff of bare rock; and, calling\n",
      "it Starvation Peak, he told a story of how Indians had once driven\n",
      "Spaniards up there and starved them. Bo was intensely interested, and\n",
      "thereafter she watched more keenly than ever, and always had a question\n",
      "for a passing trainman. The adobe houses of the Mexicans pleased her,\n",
      "and, then the train got out into Indian country, where pueblos appeared\n",
      "near the track and Indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild\n",
      "mustangs--then she was enraptured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But these Indians are peaceful!” she exclaimed once, regretfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracious, child! You don't want to see hostile Indians, do you?”\n",
      " queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do, you bet,” was the frank rejoinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'LL bet that I'll be sorry I didn't leave you with mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--you never will!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached Albuquerque about noon, and this important station, where\n",
      "they had to change trains, had been the first dreaded anticipation of\n",
      "the journey. It certainly was a busy place--full of jabbering Mexicans,\n",
      "stalking, red-faced, wicked-looking cowboys, lolling Indians. In the\n",
      "confusion Helen would have been hard put to it to preserve calmness,\n",
      "with Bo to watch, and all that baggage to carry, and the other train to\n",
      "find; but the kindly brakeman who had been attentive to them now helped\n",
      "them off the train into the other--a service for which Helen was very\n",
      "grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Albuquerque's a hard place,” confided the trainman. “Better stay in the\n",
      "car--and don't hang out the windows.... Good luck to you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a few passengers were in the car and they were Mexicans at the\n",
      "forward end. This branch train consisted of one passenger-coach, with a\n",
      "baggage-car, attached to a string of freight-cars. Helen told herself,\n",
      "somewhat grimly, that soon she would know surely whether or not her\n",
      "suspicions of Harve Riggs had warrant. If he was going on to Magdalena\n",
      "on that day he must go in this coach. Presently Bo, who was not obeying\n",
      "admonitions, drew her head out of the window. Her eyes were wide in\n",
      "amaze, her mouth open.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! I saw that man Riggs!” she whispered. “He's going to get on this\n",
      "train.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I saw him yesterday,” replied Helen, soberly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's followed you--the--the--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Bo, don't get excited,” remonstrated Helen. “We've left home now.\n",
      "We've got to take things as they come. Never mind if Riggs has followed\n",
      "me. I'll settle him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Then you won't speak--have anything to do with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't if I can help it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Other passengers boarded the train, dusty, uncouth, ragged men, and\n",
      "some hard-featured, poorly clad women, marked by toil, and several more\n",
      "Mexicans. With bustle and loud talk they found their several seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen saw Harve Riggs enter, burdened with much luggage. He was a\n",
      "man of about medium height, of dark, flashy appearance, cultivating long\n",
      "black mustache and hair. His apparel was striking, as it consisted of\n",
      "black frock-coat, black trousers stuffed in high, fancy-topped boots,\n",
      "an embroidered vest, and flowing tie, and a black sombrero. His belt and\n",
      "gun were prominent. It was significant that he excited comment among the\n",
      "other passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself,\n",
      "and, turning abruptly, approached the seat occupied by the girls. When\n",
      "he reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite, took off\n",
      "his sombrero, and deliberately looked at Helen. His eyes were light,\n",
      "glinting, with hard, restless quiver, and his mouth was coarse and\n",
      "arrogant. Helen had never seen him detached from her home surroundings,\n",
      "and now the difference struck cold upon her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Nell!” he said. “Surprised to see me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she replied, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll gamble you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, I told you the day before I left home that nothing you\n",
      "could do or say mattered to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon that ain't so, Nell. Any woman I keep track of has reason to\n",
      "think. An' you know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you followed me--out here?” demanded Helen, and her voice, despite\n",
      "her control, quivered with anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sure did,” he replied, and there was as much thought of himself in\n",
      "the act as there was of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why? Why? It's useless--hopeless.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I swore I'd have you, or nobody else would,” he replied, and here, in\n",
      "the passion of his voice there sounded egotism rather than hunger for\n",
      "a woman's love. “But I reckon I'd have struck West anyhow, sooner or\n",
      "later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're not going to--all the way--to Pine?” faltered Helen, momentarily\n",
      "weakening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll camp on your trail from now on,” he declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Bo sat bolt-upright, with pale face and flashing eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, you leave Nell alone,” she burst out, in ringing, brave\n",
      "young voice. “I'll tell you what--I'll bet--if you follow her and\n",
      "nag her any more, my uncle Al or some cowboy will run you out of the\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Pepper!” replied Riggs, coolly. “I see your manners haven't\n",
      "improved an' you're still wild about cowboys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“People don't have good manners with--with--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, hush!” admonished Helen. It was difficult to reprove Bo just then,\n",
      "for that young lady had not the slightest fear of Riggs. Indeed, she\n",
      "looked as if she could slap his face. And Helen realized that however\n",
      "her intelligence had grasped the possibilities of leaving home for a\n",
      "wild country, and whatever her determination to be brave, the actual\n",
      "beginning of self-reliance had left her spirit weak. She would rise\n",
      "out of that. But just now this flashing-eyed little sister seemed a\n",
      "protector. Bo would readily adapt herself to the West, Helen thought,\n",
      "because she was so young, primitive, elemental.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Bo turned her back to Riggs and looked out of the window. The\n",
      "man laughed. Then he stood up and leaned over Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm goin' wherever you go,” he said, steadily. “You can take that\n",
      "friendly or not, just as it pleases you. But if you've got any sense\n",
      "you'll not give these people out here a hunch against me. I might hurt\n",
      "somebody.... An' wouldn't it be better--to act friends? For I'm goin' to\n",
      "look after you, whether you like it or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had considered this man an annoyance, and later a menace, and now\n",
      "she must declare open enmity with him. However disgusting the idea that\n",
      "he considered himself a factor in her new life, it was the truth. He\n",
      "existed, he had control over his movements. She could not change that.\n",
      "She hated the need of thinking so much about him; and suddenly, with a\n",
      "hot, bursting anger, she hated the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll not look after me. I'll take care of myself,” she said, and\n",
      "she turned her back upon him. She heard him mutter under his breath and\n",
      "slowly move away down the car. Then Bo slipped a hand in hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind, Nell,” she whispered. “You know what old Sheriff Haines\n",
      "said about Harve Riggs. 'A four-flush would-be gun-fighter! If he ever\n",
      "strikes a real Western town he'll get run out of it.' I just wish my\n",
      "red-faced cowboy had got on this train!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt a rush of gladness that she had yielded to Bo's wild\n",
      "importunities to take her West. The spirit which had made Bo\n",
      "incorrigible at home probably would make her react happily to life out\n",
      "in this free country. Yet Helen, with all her warmth and gratefulness,\n",
      "had to laugh at her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your red-faced cowboy! Why, Bo, you were scared stiff. And now you\n",
      "claim him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly could love that fellow,” replied Bo, dreamily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Child, you've been saying that about fellows for a long time. And\n",
      "you've never looked twice at any of them yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was different.... Nell, I'll bet he comes to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope he does. I wish he was on this train. I liked his looks, Bo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Nell dear, he looked at ME first and last--so don't get your\n",
      "hopes up.... Oh, the train's starting!... Good-by, Albu-ker--what's that\n",
      "awful name?... Nell, let's eat dinner. I'm starved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen forgot her troubles and the uncertain future, and what with\n",
      "listening to Bo's chatter, and partaking again of the endless good\n",
      "things to eat in the huge basket, and watching the noble mountains, she\n",
      "drew once more into happy mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valley of the Rio Grande opened to view, wide near at hand in a\n",
      "great gray-green gap between the bare black mountains, narrow in the\n",
      "distance, where the yellow river wound away, glistening under a hot\n",
      "sun. Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican children that\n",
      "darted into adobe huts as the train clattered by, and she exclaimed her\n",
      "pleasure in the Indians, and the mustangs, and particularly in a group\n",
      "of cowboys riding into town on spirited horses. Helen saw all Bo pointed\n",
      "out, but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung\n",
      "longest, and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something\n",
      "from her. She had never before experienced any feeling like that; she\n",
      "had never seen a tenth so far. And the sight awoke something strange\n",
      "in her. The sun was burning hot, as she could tell when she put a hand\n",
      "outside the window, and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the\n",
      "train. She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest\n",
      "were the sun and the dust and the wind. And her realization made her\n",
      "love them. It was there; the open, the wild, the beautiful, the lonely\n",
      "land; and she felt the poignant call of blood in her--to seek, to\n",
      "strive, to find, to live. One look down that yellow valley, endless\n",
      "between its dark iron ramparts, had given her understanding of her\n",
      "uncle. She must be like him in spirit, as it was claimed she resembled\n",
      "him otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life, and,\n",
      "with her bright head on the faded cloak, she went to sleep. But Helen\n",
      "kept steady, farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain; and\n",
      "during the long hours, as she watched through clouds of dust and veils\n",
      "of heat, some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to\n",
      "change and then to fix. It was her physical acceptance--her eyes and her\n",
      "senses taking the West as she had already taken it in spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman should love her home wherever fate placed her, Helen believed,\n",
      "and not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living. How\n",
      "could life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous\n",
      "vastness of bare earth and open sky, where the need to achieve made\n",
      "thinking and pondering superficial?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the Rio\n",
      "Grande, and then of its paralleled mountain ranges. But the miles\n",
      "brought compensation in other valleys, other bold, black upheavals of\n",
      "rock, and then again bare, boundless yellow plains, and sparsely cedared\n",
      "ridges, and white dry washes, ghastly in the sunlight, and dazzling\n",
      "beds of alkali, and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers\n",
      "bloomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She noted, too, that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had\n",
      "begun to shade to red--and this she knew meant an approach to\n",
      "Arizona. Arizona, the wild, the lonely, the red desert, the green\n",
      "plateau--Arizona with its thundering rivers, its unknown spaces, its\n",
      "pasture-lands and timber-lands, its wild horses, cowboys, outlaws,\n",
      "wolves and lions and savages! As to a boy, that name stirred and\n",
      "thrilled and sang to her of nameless, sweet, intangible things,\n",
      "mysterious and all of adventure. But she, being a girl of twenty, who\n",
      "had accepted responsibilities, must conceal the depths of her heart and\n",
      "that which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being\n",
      "born a boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed, while Helen watched and learned and dreamed. The train\n",
      "stopped, at long intervals, at wayside stations where there seemed\n",
      "nothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans, and dust and heat. Bo awoke\n",
      "and began to chatter, and to dig into the basket. She learned from the\n",
      "conductor that Magdalena was only two stations on. And she was full of\n",
      "conjectures as to who would meet them, what would happen. So Helen was\n",
      "drawn back to sober realities, in which there was considerable zest.\n",
      "Assuredly she did not know what was going to happen. Twice Riggs passed\n",
      "up and down the aisle, his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile\n",
      "deliberately forced upon her sight. But again Helen fought a growing\n",
      "dread with contemptuous scorn. This fellow was not half a man. It was\n",
      "not conceivable what he could do, except annoy her, until she arrived\n",
      "at Pine. Her uncle was to meet her or send for her at Snowdrop, which\n",
      "place, Helen knew, was distant a good long ride by stage from Magdalena.\n",
      "This stage-ride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey, in\n",
      "Helen's considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell!” cried Bo, with delight. “We're nearly there! Next station,\n",
      "the conductor said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder if the stage travels at night,” said Helen, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure it does!” replied the irrepressible Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The train, though it clattered along as usual, seemed to Helen to fly.\n",
      "There the sun was setting over bleak New Mexican bluffs, Magdalena was\n",
      "at hand, and night, and adventure. Helen's heart beat fast. She\n",
      "watched the yellow plains where the cattle grazed; their presence, and\n",
      "irrigation ditches and cottonwood-trees told her that the railroad part\n",
      "of the journey was nearly ended. Then, at Bo's little scream, she\n",
      "looked across the car and out of the window to see a line of low, flat,\n",
      "red-adobe houses. The train began to slow down. Helen saw children run,\n",
      "white children and Mexican together; then more houses, and high upon a\n",
      "hill an immense adobe church, crude and glaring, yet somehow beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen told Bo to put on her bonnet, and, performing a like office for\n",
      "herself, she was ashamed of the trembling of her fingers. There were\n",
      "bustle and talk in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The train stopped. Helen peered out to see a straggling crowd of\n",
      "Mexicans and Indians, all motionless and stolid, as if trains or nothing\n",
      "else mattered. Next Helen saw a white man, and that was a relief. He\n",
      "stood out in front of the others. Tall and broad, somehow striking, he\n",
      "drew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in gray-fringed\n",
      "buckskin, and carrying a rifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER V\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, there was no kindly brakeman to help the sisters with their\n",
      "luggage. Helen bade Bo take her share; thus burdened, they made an\n",
      "awkward and laborious shift to get off the train.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the platform of the car a strong hand seized Helen's heavy bag,\n",
      "with which she was straining, and a loud voice called out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, we're here--sure out in the wild an' woolly West!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was Riggs, and he had possessed himself of part of her\n",
      "baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious\n",
      "crowd than to be really kind. In the excitement of arriving Helen\n",
      "had forgotten him. The manner of sudden reminder--the insincerity of\n",
      "it--made her temper flash. She almost fell, encumbered as she was, in\n",
      "her hurry to descend the steps. She saw the tall hunter in gray step\n",
      "forward close to her as she reached for the bag Riggs held.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Riggs, I'll carry my bag,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me lug this. You help Bo with hers,” he replied, familiarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I want it,” she rejoined, quietly, with sharp determination. No\n",
      "little force was needed to pull the bag away from Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here, Helen, you ain't goin' any farther with that joke, are you?”\n",
      " he queried, deprecatingly, and he still spoke quite loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's no joke to me,” replied Helen. “I told you I didn't want your\n",
      "attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. But that was temper. I'm your friend--from your home town. An' I\n",
      "ain't goin' to let a quarrel keep me from lookin' after you till you're\n",
      "safe at your uncle's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen turned her back upon him. The tall hunter had just helped Bo off\n",
      "the car. Then Helen looked up into a smooth bronzed face and piercing\n",
      "gray eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you Helen Rayner?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name's Dale. I've come to meet you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! My uncle sent you?” added Helen, in quick relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I can't say Al sent me,” began the man, “but I reckon--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was interrupted by Riggs, who, grasping Helen by the arm, pulled her\n",
      "back a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, mister, did Auchincloss send you to meet my young friends here?”\n",
      " he demanded, arrogantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's glance turned from Helen to Riggs. She could not read this quiet\n",
      "gray gaze, but it thrilled her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I come on my own hook,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll understand, then--they're in my charge,” added Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time the steady light-gray eyes met Helen's, and if there was not a\n",
      "smile in them or behind them she was still further baffled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Helen, I reckon you said you didn't want this fellow's attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly said that,” replied Helen, quickly. Just then Bo slipped\n",
      "close to her and gave her arm a little squeeze. Probably Bo's thought\n",
      "was like hers--here was a real Western man. That was her first\n",
      "impression, and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased\n",
      "nerves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs swaggered closer to Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Buckskin, I hail from Texas--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're wastin' our time an' we've need to hurry,” interrupted Dale. His\n",
      "tone seemed friendly. “An' if you ever lived long in Texas you wouldn't\n",
      "pester a lady an' you sure wouldn't talk like you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” shouted Riggs, hotly. He dropped his right hand significantly to\n",
      "his hip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't throw your gun. It might go off,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever Riggs's intention had been--and it was probably just what Dale\n",
      "evidently had read it--he now flushed an angry red and jerked at his\n",
      "gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's hand flashed too swiftly for Helen's eye to follow it. But she\n",
      "heard the thud as it struck. The gun went flying to the platform and\n",
      "scattered a group of Indians and Mexicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll hurt yourself some day,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had never heard a slow, cool voice like this hunter's. Without\n",
      "excitement or emotion or hurry, it yet seemed full and significant of\n",
      "things the words did not mean. Bo uttered a strange little exultant cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs's arm had dropped limp. No doubt it was numb. He stared, and his\n",
      "predominating expression was surprise. As the shuffling crowd began to\n",
      "snicker and whisper, Riggs gave Dale a malignant glance, shifted it to\n",
      "Helen, and then lurched away in the direction of his gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale did not pay any more attention to him. Gathering up Helen's\n",
      "baggage, he said, “Come on,” and shouldered a lane through the gaping\n",
      "crowd. The girls followed close at his heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! what 'd I tell you?” whispered Bo. “Oh, you're all atremble!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was aware of her unsteadiness; anger and fear and relief in quick\n",
      "succession had left her rather weak. Once through the motley crowd\n",
      "of loungers, she saw an old gray stage-coach and four lean horses. A\n",
      "grizzled, sunburned man sat on the driver's seat, whip and reins in\n",
      "hand. Beside him was a younger man with rifle across his knees. Another\n",
      "man, young, tall, lean, dark, stood holding the coach door open. He\n",
      "touched his sombrero to the girls. His eyes were sharp as he addressed\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, wasn't you held up?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But some long-haired galoot was tryin' to hold up the girls.\n",
      "Wanted to throw his gun on me. I was sure scared,” replied Dale, as he\n",
      "deposited the luggage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo laughed. Her eyes, resting upon Dale, were warm and bright. The\n",
      "young man at the coach door took a second look at her, and then a smile\n",
      "changed the dark hardness of his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale helped the girls up the high step into the stage, and then, placing\n",
      "the lighter luggage, in with them, he threw the heavier pieces on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joe, climb up,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt,” drawled the driver, “let's ooze along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale hesitated, with his hand on the door. He glanced at the crowd, now\n",
      "edging close again, and then at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I ought to tell you,” he said, and indecision appeared to\n",
      "concern him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” exclaimed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad news. But talkin' takes time. An' we mustn't lose any.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There's need of hurry?” queried Helen, sitting up sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this the stage to Snowdrop?\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. That leaves in the mornin'. We rustled this old trap to get a start\n",
      "to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sooner the better. But I--I don't understand,” said Helen,\n",
      "bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It'll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin' stage,” returned Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Safe! Oh, what do you mean?” exclaimed Helen. Apprehensively she gazed\n",
      "at him and then back at Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Explainin' will take time. An' facts may change your mind. But if you\n",
      "can't trust me--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trust you!” interposed Helen, blankly. “You mean to take us to\n",
      "Snowdrop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon we'd better go roundabout an' not hit Snowdrop,” he replied,\n",
      "shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then to Pine--to my uncle--Al Auchincloss?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'm goin' to try hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen caught her breath. She divined that some peril menaced her. She\n",
      "looked steadily, with all a woman's keenness, into this man's face. The\n",
      "moment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the West had in store\n",
      "for her. Her future and that of Bo's were now to be dependent upon her\n",
      "judgments. It was a hard moment and, though she shivered inwardly, she\n",
      "welcomed the initial and inevitable step. This man Dale, by his dress of\n",
      "buckskin, must be either scout or hunter. His size, his action, the tone\n",
      "of his voice had been reassuring. But Helen must decide from what she\n",
      "saw in his face whether or not to trust him. And that face was\n",
      "clear bronze, unlined, unshadowed, like a tranquil mask, clean-cut,\n",
      "strong-jawed, with eyes of wonderful transparent gray.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'll trust you,” she said. “Get in, and let us hurry. Then you can\n",
      "explain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All ready, Bill. Send 'em along,” called Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to stoop to enter the stage, and, once in, he appeared to fill\n",
      "that side upon which he sat. Then the driver cracked his whip; the\n",
      "stage lurched and began to roll; the motley crowd was left behind. Helen\n",
      "awakened to the reality, as she saw Bo staring with big eyes at the\n",
      "hunter, that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began\n",
      "with the rattling roll of that old stage-coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward, holding his rifle between\n",
      "his knees. The light shone better upon his features now that he was\n",
      "bareheaded. Helen had never seen a face like that, which at first glance\n",
      "appeared darkly bronzed and hard, and then became clear, cold, aloof,\n",
      "still, intense. She wished she might see a smile upon it. And now that\n",
      "the die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it. There was\n",
      "singular force in it, but she did not recognize what kind of force. One\n",
      "instant she thought it was stern, and the next that it was sweet, and\n",
      "again that it was neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm glad you've got your sister,” he said, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did you know she's my sister?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon she looks like you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one else ever thought so,” replied Helen, trying to smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had no difficulty in smiling, as she said, “Wish I was half as pretty\n",
      "as Nell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell. Isn't your name Helen?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. But my--some few call me Nell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I like Nell better than Helen. An' what's yours?” went on Dale, looking\n",
      "at Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine's Bo. Just plain B-o. Isn't it silly? But I wasn't asked when they\n",
      "gave it to me,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo. It's nice an' short. Never heard it before. But I haven't met many\n",
      "people for years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! we've left the town!” cried Bo. “Look, Nell! How bare! It's just\n",
      "like desert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is desert. We've forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a\n",
      "tree.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen glanced out. A flat, dull-green expanse waved away from the road\n",
      "on and on to a bright, dark horizon-line, where the sun was setting\n",
      "rayless in a clear sky. Open, desolate, and lonely, the scene gave her a\n",
      "cold thrill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did your uncle Al ever write anythin' about a man named Beasley?” asked\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed he did,” replied Helen, with a start of surprise. “Beasley! That\n",
      "name is familiar to us--and detestable. My uncle complained of this man\n",
      "for years. Then he grew bitter--accused Beasley. But the last year or so\n",
      "not a word!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, now,” began the hunter, earnestly, “let's get the bad news over.\n",
      "I'm sorry you must be worried. But you must learn to take the West as it\n",
      "is. There's good an' bad, maybe more bad. That's because the country's\n",
      "young.... So to come right out with it--this Beasley hired a gang of\n",
      "outlaws to meet the stage you was goin' in to Snowdrop--to-morrow--an'\n",
      "to make off with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make off with me?” ejaculated Helen, bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kidnap you! Which, in that gang, would be worse than killing you!”\n",
      " declared Dale, grimly, and he closed a huge fist on his knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was utterly astounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How hor-rible!” she gasped out. “Make off with me!... What in Heaven's\n",
      "name for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo gave vent to a fierce little utterance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For reasons you ought to guess,” replied Dale, and he leaned forward\n",
      "again. Neither his voice nor face changed in the least, but yet there\n",
      "was a something about him that fascinated Helen. “I'm a hunter. I live\n",
      "in the woods. A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm\n",
      "an' I took to an old log cabin. Soon as I got there I heard horses.\n",
      "I hid up in the loft. Some men rode up an' come in. It was dark. They\n",
      "couldn't see me. An' they talked. It turned out they were Snake Anson\n",
      "an' his gang of sheep-thieves. They expected to meet Beasley there.\n",
      "Pretty soon he came. He told Anson how old Al, your uncle, was on his\n",
      "last legs--how he had sent for you to have his property when he died.\n",
      "Beasley swore he had claims on Al. An' he made a deal with Anson to get\n",
      "you out of the way. He named the day you were to reach Magdalena. With\n",
      "Al dead an' you not there, Beasley could get the property. An' then he\n",
      "wouldn't care if you did come to claim it. It 'd be too late.... Well,\n",
      "they rode away that night. An' next day I rustled down to Pine. They're\n",
      "all my friends at Pine, except old Al. But they think I'm queer. I\n",
      "didn't want to confide in many people. Beasley is strong in Pine, an'\n",
      "for that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides\n",
      "Beasley. So I went to see your uncle. He never had any use for me\n",
      "because he thought I was lazy like an Indian. Old Al hates lazy men.\n",
      "Then we fell out--or he fell out--because he believed a tame lion of\n",
      "mine had killed some of his sheep. An' now I reckon that Tom might have\n",
      "done it. I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasley's about you, but\n",
      "old Al wouldn't listen. He's cross--very cross. An' when I tried to tell\n",
      "him, why, he went right out of his head. Sent me off the ranch. Now I\n",
      "reckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in. Finally I went to four\n",
      "friends I could trust. They're Mormon boys--brothers. That's Joe out\n",
      "on top, with the driver. I told them all about Beasley's deal an' asked\n",
      "them to help me. So we planned to beat Anson an' his gang to Magdalena.\n",
      "It happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine.\n",
      "An' we had to go careful. But the boys had a couple of friends\n",
      "here--Mormons, too, who agreed to help us. They had this old stage....\n",
      "An' here you are.” Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at\n",
      "Helen and then at Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're perfectly splendid!” cried Bo, ringingly. She was white; her\n",
      "fingers were clenched; her eyes blazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale appeared startled out of his gravity, and surprised, then pleased.\n",
      "A smile made his face like a boy's. Helen felt her body all rigid, yet\n",
      "slightly trembling. Her hands were cold. The horror of this revelation\n",
      "held her speechless. But in her heart she echoed Bo's exclamation of\n",
      "admiration and gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far, then,” resumed Dale, with a heavy breath of relief. “No wonder\n",
      "you're upset. I've a blunt way of talkin'.... Now we've thirty miles to\n",
      "ride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off. To-day sometime the\n",
      "rest of the boys--Roy, John, an' Hal--were to leave Show Down, which's\n",
      "a town farther on from Snowdrop. They have my horses an' packs besides\n",
      "their own. Somewhere on the road we'll meet them--to-night, maybe--or\n",
      "tomorrow. I hope not to-night, because that 'd mean Anson's gang was\n",
      "ridin' in to Magdalena.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen wrung her hands helplessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, have I no courage?” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm as scared as you are,” said Bo, consolingly, embracing her\n",
      "sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon that's natural,” said Dale, as if excusing them. “But, scared\n",
      "or not, you both brace up. It's a bad job. But I've done my best. An'\n",
      "you'll be safer with me an' the Beeman boys than you'd be in Magdalena,\n",
      "or anywhere else, except your uncle's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.--Mr. Dale,” faltered Helen, with her tears falling, “don't think me\n",
      "a coward--or--or ungrateful. I'm neither. It's only I'm so--so shocked.\n",
      "After all we hoped and expected--this--this--is such a--a terrible\n",
      "surprise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind, Nell dear. Let's take what comes,” murmured Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's the talk,” said Dale. “You see, I've come right out with the\n",
      "worst. Maybe we'll get through easy. When we meet the boys we'll take to\n",
      "the horses an' the trails. Can you ride?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo has been used to horses all her life and I ride fairly well,”\n",
      " responded Helen. The idea of riding quickened her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good! We may have some hard ridin' before I get you up to Pine. Hello!\n",
      "What's that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Above the creaking, rattling, rolling roar of the stage Helen heard a\n",
      "rapid beat of hoofs. A horse flashed by, galloping hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale opened the door and peered out. The stage rolled to a halt. He\n",
      "stepped down and gazed ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joe, who was that?” he queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nary me. An' Bill didn't know him, either,” replied Joe. “I seen him\n",
      "'way back. He was ridin' some. An' he slowed up goin' past us. Now he's\n",
      "runnin' again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook his head as if he did not like the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, he'll never get by Roy on this road,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe he'll get by before Roy strikes in on the road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't likely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not restrain her fears. “Mr. Dale, you think he was a\n",
      "messenger--going ahead to post that--that Anson gang?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might be,” replied Dale, simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the young man called Joe leaned out from the seat above and called:\n",
      "“Miss Helen, don't you worry. Thet fellar is more liable to stop lead\n",
      "than anythin' else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His words, meant to be kind and reassuring, were almost as sinister to\n",
      "Helen as the menace to her own life. Long had she known how cheap life\n",
      "was held in the West, but she had only known it abstractly, and she had\n",
      "never let the fact remain before her consciousness. This cheerful young\n",
      "man spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf. The thought it roused\n",
      "was tragic--for bloodshed was insupportable to her--and then the thrills\n",
      "which followed were so new, strange, bold, and tingling that they were\n",
      "revolting. Helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths, of instincts at\n",
      "which she was amazed and ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joe, hand down that basket of grub--the small one with the canteen,”\n",
      " said Dale, reaching out a long arm. Presently he placed a cloth-covered\n",
      "basket inside the stage. “Girls, eat all you want an' then some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have a basket half full yet,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll need it all before we get to Pine.... Now, I'll ride up on top\n",
      "with the boys an' eat my supper. It'll be dark, presently, an' we'll\n",
      "stop often to listen. But don't be scared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he took his rifle and, closing the door, clambered up to the\n",
      "driver's seat. Then the stage lurched again and began to roll along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the least thing to wonder at of this eventful evening was the way Bo\n",
      "reached for the basket of food. Helen simply stared at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you CAN'T EAT!” she exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should smile I can,” replied that practical young lady. “And you're\n",
      "going to if I have to stuff things in your mouth. Where's your wits,\n",
      "Nell? He said we must eat. That means our strength is going to have some\n",
      "pretty severe trials.... Gee! it's all great--just like a story! The\n",
      "unexpected--why, he looks like a prince turned hunter!--long, dark,\n",
      "stage journey--held up--fight--escape--wild ride on horses--woods\n",
      "and camps and wild places--pursued--hidden in the forest--more hard\n",
      "rides--then safe at the ranch. And of course he falls madly in love with\n",
      "me--no, you, for I'll be true to my Las Vegas lover--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, silly! Bo, tell me, aren't you SCARED?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scared! I'm scared stiff. But if Western girls stand such things, we\n",
      "can. No Western girl is going to beat ME!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That brought Helen to a realization of the brave place she had given\n",
      "herself in dreams, and she was at once ashamed of herself and wildly\n",
      "proud of this little sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, thank Heaven I brought you with me!” exclaimed Helen, fervently.\n",
      "“I'll eat if it chokes me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon she found herself actually hungry, and while she ate she\n",
      "glanced out of the stage, first from one side and then from the other.\n",
      "These windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in.\n",
      "The sun had long since sunk. Out to the west, where a bold, black\n",
      "horizon-line swept away endlessly, the sky was clear gold, shading\n",
      "to yellow and blue above. Stars were out, pale and wan, but growing\n",
      "brighter. The earth appeared bare and heaving, like a calm sea. The wind\n",
      "bore a fragrance new to Helen, acridly sweet and clean, and it was so\n",
      "cold it made her fingers numb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard some animal yelp,” said Bo, suddenly, and she listened with\n",
      "head poised.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Helen heard nothing save the steady clip-clop of hoofs, the clink of\n",
      "chains, the creak and rattle of the old stage, and occasionally the low\n",
      "voices of the men above.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls had satisfied hunger and thirst, night had settled down\n",
      "black. They pulled the cloaks up over them, and close together leaned\n",
      "back in a corner of the seat and talked in whispers. Helen did not have\n",
      "much to say, but Bo was talkative.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This beats me!” she said once, after an interval. “Where are we, Nell?\n",
      "Those men up there are Mormons. Maybe they are abducting us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dale isn't a Mormon,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could tell by the way he spoke of his friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I wish it wasn't so dark. I'm not afraid of men in daylight....\n",
      "Nell, did you ever see such a wonderful looking fellow? What'd they call\n",
      "him? Milt--Milt Dale. He said he lived in the woods. If I hadn't fallen\n",
      "in love with that cowboy who called me--well, I'd be a goner now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After an interval of silence Bo whispered, startlingly, “Wonder if Harve\n",
      "Riggs is following us now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course he is,” replied Helen, hopelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He'd better look out. Why, Nell, he never saw--he never--what did Uncle\n",
      "Al used to call it?--sav--savvied--that's it. Riggs never savvied that\n",
      "hunter. But I did, you bet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Savvied! What do you mean, Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean that long-haired galoot never saw his real danger. But I felt\n",
      "it. Something went light inside me. Dale never took him seriously at\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs will turn up at Uncle Al's, sure as I'm born,” said Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him turn,” replied Bo, contemptuously. “Nell, don't you ever bother\n",
      "your head again about him. I'll bet they're all men out here. And I\n",
      "wouldn't be in Harve Riggs's boots for a lot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After that Bo talked of her uncle and his fatal illness, and from that\n",
      "she drifted back to the loved ones at home, now seemingly at the other\n",
      "side of the world, and then she broke down and cried, after which she\n",
      "fell asleep on Helen's shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Helen could not have fallen asleep if she had wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had always, since she could remember, longed for a moving, active\n",
      "life; and for want of a better idea she had chosen to dream of gipsies.\n",
      "And now it struck her grimly that, if these first few hours of her\n",
      "advent in the West were forecasts of the future, she was destined to\n",
      "have her longings more than fulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the stage rolled slower and slower, until it came to a halt.\n",
      "Then the horses heaved, the harnesses clinked, the men whispered.\n",
      "Otherwise there was an intense quiet. She looked out, expecting to\n",
      "find it pitch-dark. It was black, yet a transparent blackness. To her\n",
      "surprise she could see a long way. A shooting-star electrified her.\n",
      "The men were listening. She listened, too, but beyond the slight sounds\n",
      "about the stage she heard nothing. Presently the driver clucked to his\n",
      "horses, and travel was resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while the stage rolled on rapidly, evidently downhill, swaying\n",
      "from side to side, and rattling as if about to fall to pieces. Then it\n",
      "slowed on a level, and again it halted for a few moments, and once more\n",
      "in motion it began a laborsome climb. Helen imagined miles had been\n",
      "covered. The desert appeared to heave into billows, growing rougher, and\n",
      "dark, round bushes dimly stood out. The road grew uneven and rocky, and\n",
      "when the stage began another descent its violent rocking jolted Bo out\n",
      "of her sleep and in fact almost out of Helen's arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where am I?” asked Bo, dazedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you're having your heart's desire, but I can't tell you where you\n",
      "are,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo awakened thoroughly, which fact was now no wonder, considering the\n",
      "jostling of the old stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on to me, Nell!... Is it a runaway?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We've come about a thousand miles like this, I think,” replied Helen.\n",
      "“I've not a whole bone in my body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo peered out of the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, how dark and lonesome! But it'd be nice if it wasn't so cold. I'm\n",
      "freezing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you loved cold air,” taunted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Nell, you begin to talk like yourself,” responded Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was difficult to hold on to the stage and each other and the cloak\n",
      "all at once, but they succeeded, except in the roughest places, when\n",
      "from time to time they were bounced around. Bo sustained a sharp rap on\n",
      "the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oooooo!” she moaned. “Nell Rayner, I'll never forgive you for fetching\n",
      "me on this awful trip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just think of your handsome Las Vegas cowboy,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either this remark subdued Bo or the suggestion sufficed to reconcile\n",
      "her to the hardships of the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, as they talked and maintained silence and tried to sleep, the\n",
      "driver of the stage kept at his task after the manner of Western men who\n",
      "knew how to get the best out of horses and bad roads and distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by the stage halted again and remained at a standstill for so\n",
      "long, with the men whispering on top, that Helen and Bo were roused to\n",
      "apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a sharp whistle came from the darkness ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's Roy,” said Joe Beeman, in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon. An' meetin' us so quick looks bad,” replied Dale. “Drive on,\n",
      "Bill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe it seems quick to you,” muttered the driver, “but if we hain't\n",
      "come thirty mile, an' if thet ridge thar hain't your turnin'-off place,\n",
      "why, I don't know nothin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stage rolled on a little farther, while Helen and Bo sat clasping\n",
      "each other tight, wondering with bated breath what was to be the next\n",
      "thing to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then once more they were at a standstill. Helen heard the thud of boots\n",
      "striking the ground, and the snorts of horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I see horses,” whispered Bo, excitedly. “There, to the side of\n",
      "the road... and here comes a man.... Oh, if he shouldn't be the one\n",
      "they're expecting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen peered out to see a tall, dark form, moving silently, and beyond\n",
      "it a vague outline of horses, and then pale gleams of what must have\n",
      "been pack-loads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale loomed up, and met the stranger in the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Milt? You got the girl sure, or you wouldn't be here,” said a\n",
      "low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, I've got two girls--sisters,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man Roy whistled softly under his breath. Then another lean, rangy\n",
      "form strode out of the darkness, and was met by Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, boys--how about Anson's gang?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At Snowdrop, drinkin' an' quarrelin'. Reckon they'll leave there about\n",
      "daybreak,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long have you been here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe a couple of hours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any horse go by?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, a strange rider passed us before dark. He was hittin' the road.\n",
      "An' he's got by here before you came.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't like thet news,” replied Roy, tersely. “Let's rustle. With\n",
      "girls on hossback you'll need all the start you can get. Hey, John?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake Anson shore can foller hoss tracks,” replied the third man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, say the word,” went on Roy, as he looked up at the stars.\n",
      "“Daylight not far away. Here's the forks of the road, an' your hosses,\n",
      "an' our outfit. You can be in the pines by sunup.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the silence that ensued Helen heard the throb of her heart and\n",
      "the panting little breaths of her sister. They both peered out, hands\n",
      "clenched together, watching and listening in strained attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's possible that rider last night wasn't a messenger to Anson,” said\n",
      "Dale. “In that case Anson won't make anythin' of our wheel tracks or\n",
      "horse tracks. He'll go right on to meet the regular stage. Bill, can you\n",
      "go back an' meet the stage comin' before Anson does?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckon so--an' take it easy at thet,” replied Bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” continued Dale, instantly. “John, you an' Joe an' Hal ride\n",
      "back to meet the regular stage. An' when you meet it get on an' be on it\n",
      "when Anson holds it up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's shore agreeable to me,” drawled John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd like to be on it, too,” said Roy, grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'll need you till I'm safe in the woods. Bill, hand down the bags.\n",
      "An' you, Roy, help me pack them. Did you get all the supplies I wanted?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore did. If the young ladies ain't powerful particular you can feed\n",
      "them well for a couple of months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale wheeled and, striding to the stage, he opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, you're not asleep? Come,” he called.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo stepped down first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was asleep till this--this vehicle fell off the road back a ways,”\n",
      " she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Beeman's low laugh was significant. He took off his sombrero and\n",
      "stood silent. The old driver smothered a loud guffaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Veehicle! Wal, I'll be doggoned! Joe, did you hear thet? All the spunky\n",
      "gurls ain't born out West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Helen followed with cloak and bag Roy assisted her, and she\n",
      "encountered keen eyes upon her face. He seemed both gentle and\n",
      "respectful, and she felt his solicitude. His heavy gun, swinging low,\n",
      "struck her as she stepped down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale reached into the stage and hauled out baskets and bags. These he\n",
      "set down on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turn around, Bill, an' go along with you. John an' Hal will follow\n",
      "presently,” ordered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, gurls,” said Bill, looking down upon them, “I was shore powerful\n",
      "glad to meet you-all. An' I'm ashamed of my country--offerin' two sich\n",
      "purty gurls insults an' low-down tricks. But shore you'll go through\n",
      "safe now. You couldn't be in better company fer ridin' or huntin' or\n",
      "marryin' or gittin' religion--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up, you old grizzly!” broke in Dale, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! Good-by, gurls, an' good luck!” ended Bill, as he began to\n",
      "whip the reins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo said good-by quite distinctly, but Helen could only murmur hers. The\n",
      "old driver seemed a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the horses wheeled and stamped, the stage careened and creaked,\n",
      "presently to roll out of sight in the gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're shiverin',” said Dale, suddenly, looking down upon Helen. She\n",
      "felt his big, hard hand clasp hers. “Cold as ice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am c-cold,” replied Helen. “I guess we're not warmly dressed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, we roasted all day, and now we're freezing,” declared Bo. “I\n",
      "didn't know it was winter at night out here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, haven't you some warm gloves an' a coat?” asked Roy, anxiously.\n",
      "“It 'ain't begun to get cold yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, we've heavy gloves, riding-suits and boots--all fine and new--in\n",
      "this black bag,” said Bo, enthusiastically kicking a bag at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, so we have. But a lot of good they'll do us, to-night,” returned\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, you'd do well to change right here,” said Roy, earnestly. “It'll\n",
      "save time in the long run an' a lot of sufferin' before sunup.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen stared at the young man, absolutely amazed with his simplicity.\n",
      "She was advised to change her traveling-dress for a riding-suit--out\n",
      "somewhere in a cold, windy desert--in the middle of the night--among\n",
      "strange young men!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, which bag is it?” asked Dale, as if she were his sister. And when\n",
      "she indicated the one, he picked it up. “Come off the road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo followed him, and Helen found herself mechanically at their heels.\n",
      "Dale led them a few paces off the road behind some low bushes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hurry an' change here,” he said. “We'll make a pack of your outfit an'\n",
      "leave room for this bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he stalked away and in a few strides disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo sat down to begin unlacing her shoes. Helen could just see her pale,\n",
      "pretty face and big, gleaming eyes by the light of the stars. It struck\n",
      "her then that Bo was going to make eminently more of a success of\n",
      "Western life than she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, those fellows are n-nice,” said Bo, reflectively. “Aren't you\n",
      "c-cold? Say, he said hurry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was beyond Helen's comprehension how she ever began to disrobe out\n",
      "there in that open, windy desert, but after she had gotten launched on\n",
      "the task she found that it required more fortitude than courage. The\n",
      "cold wind pierced right through her. Almost she could have laughed at\n",
      "the way Bo made things fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“G-g-g-gee!” chattered Bo. “I n-never w-was so c-c-cold in all my life.\n",
      "Nell Rayner, m-may the g-good Lord forgive y-you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was too intent on her own troubles to take breath to talk. She was\n",
      "a strong, healthy girl, swift and efficient with her hands, yet this,\n",
      "the hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced, almost overcame\n",
      "her. Bo outdistanced her by moments, helped her with buttons, and laced\n",
      "one whole boot for her. Then, with hands that stung, Helen packed the\n",
      "traveling-suits in the bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! But what an awful mess!” exclaimed Helen. “Oh, Bo, our pretty\n",
      "traveling-dresses!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll press them t-to-morrow--on a l-log,” replied Bo, and she giggled.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started for the road. Bo, strange to note, did not carry her share\n",
      "of the burden, and she seemed unsteady on her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men were waiting beside a group of horses, one of which carried a\n",
      "pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothin' slow about you,” said Dale, relieving Helen of the grip. “Roy,\n",
      "put them up while I sling on this bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy led out two of the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get up,” he said, indicating Bo. “The stirrups are short on this\n",
      "saddle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was an adept at mounting, but she made such awkward and slow work of\n",
      "it in this instance that Helen could not believe her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw 're the stirrups?” asked Roy. “Stand in them. Guess they're about\n",
      "right.... Careful now! Thet hoss is skittish. Hold him in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was not living up to the reputation with which Helen had credited\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, miss, you get up,” said Roy to Helen. And in another instant she\n",
      "found herself astride a black, spirited horse. Numb with cold as she\n",
      "was, she yet felt the coursing thrills along her veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy was at the stirrups with swift hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're taller 'n I guessed,” he said. “Stay up, but lift your foot....\n",
      "Shore now, I'm glad you have them thick, soft boots. Mebbe we'll ride\n",
      "all over the White Mountains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, do you hear that?” called Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bo did not answer. She was leaning rather unnaturally in her saddle.\n",
      "Helen became anxious. Just then Dale strode back to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All cinched up, Roy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jest ready,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dale stood beside Helen. How tall he was! His wide shoulders seemed\n",
      "on a level with the pommel of her saddle. He put an affectionate hand on\n",
      "the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His name's Ranger an' he's the fastest an' finest horse in this\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon he shore is--along with my bay,” corroborated Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, if you rode Ranger he'd beat your pet,” said Dale. “We can start\n",
      "now. Roy, you drive the pack-horses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took another look at Helen's saddle and then moved to do likewise\n",
      "with Bo's.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you--all right?” he asked, quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo reeled in her seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm n-near froze,” she replied, in a faint voice. Her face shone white\n",
      "in the starlight. Helen recognized that Bo was more than cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Bo!” she called, in distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, don't you worry, now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me carry you,” suggested Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'll s-s-stick on this horse or d-die,” fiercely retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men looked up at her white face and then at each other. Then Roy\n",
      "walked away toward the dark bunch of horses off the road and Dale swung\n",
      "astride the one horse left.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep close to me,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo fell in line and Helen brought up the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen imagined she was near the end of a dream. Presently she would\n",
      "awaken with a start and see the pale walls of her little room at\n",
      "home, and hear the cherry branches brushing her window, and the old\n",
      "clarion-voiced cock proclaim the hour of dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses trotted. And the exercise soon warmed Helen, until she was\n",
      "fairly comfortable except in her fingers. In mind, however, she grew\n",
      "more miserable as she more fully realized her situation. The night now\n",
      "became so dark that, although the head of her horse was alongside the\n",
      "flank of Bo's, she could scarcely see Bo. From time to time Helen's\n",
      "anxious query brought from her sister the answer that she was all right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had not ridden a horse for more than a year, and for several\n",
      "years she had not ridden with any regularity. Despite her thrills\n",
      "upon mounting, she had entertained misgivings. But she was agreeably\n",
      "surprised, for the horse, Ranger, had an easy gait, and she found she\n",
      "had not forgotten how to ride. Bo, having been used to riding on a farm\n",
      "near home, might be expected to acquit herself admirably. It occurred\n",
      "to Helen what a plight they would have been in but for the thick,\n",
      "comfortable riding outfits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark as the night was, Helen could dimly make out the road underneath.\n",
      "It was rocky, and apparently little used. When Dale turned off the road\n",
      "into the low brush or sage of what seemed a level plain, the traveling\n",
      "was harder, rougher, and yet no slower. The horses kept to the gait of\n",
      "the leaders. Helen, discovering it unnecessary, ceased attempting to\n",
      "guide Ranger. There were dim shapes in the gloom ahead, and always they\n",
      "gave Helen uneasiness, until closer approach proved them to be rocks\n",
      "or low, scrubby trees. These increased in both size and number as the\n",
      "horses progressed. Often Helen looked back into the gloom behind.\n",
      "This act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread. Dale\n",
      "expected to be pursued. And Helen experienced, along with the dread,\n",
      "flashes of unfamiliar resentment. Not only was there an attempt afoot\n",
      "to rob her of her heritage, but even her personal liberty. Then she\n",
      "shuddered at the significance of Dale's words regarding her possible\n",
      "abduction by this hired gang. It seemed monstrous, impossible. Yet,\n",
      "manifestly it was true enough to Dale and his allies. The West, then, in\n",
      "reality was raw, hard, inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly her horse stopped. He had come up alongside Bo's horse. Dale\n",
      "had halted ahead, and apparently was listening. Roy and the pack-train\n",
      "were out of sight in the gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” whispered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I heard a wolf,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was that cry a wolf's?” asked Bo. “I heard. It was wild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We're gettin' up close to the foot-hills,” said Dale. “Feel how much\n",
      "colder the air is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm warm now,” replied Bo. “I guess being near froze was what ailed\n",
      "me.... Nell, how 're you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm warm, too, but--” Helen answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you had your choice of being here or back home, snug in bed--which\n",
      "would you take?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo!” exclaimed Helen, aghast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'd choose to be right here on this horse,” rejoined Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale heard her, for he turned an instant, then slapped his horse and\n",
      "started on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen now rode beside Bo, and for a long time they climbed steadily in\n",
      "silence. Helen knew when that dark hour before dawn had passed, and she\n",
      "welcomed an almost imperceptible lightening in the east. Then the stars\n",
      "paled. Gradually a grayness absorbed all but the larger stars. The\n",
      "great white morning star, wonderful as Helen had never seen it, lost its\n",
      "brilliance and life and seemed to retreat into the dimming blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight came gradually, so that the gray desert became distinguishable\n",
      "by degrees. Rolling bare hills, half obscured by the gray lifting mantle\n",
      "of night, rose in the foreground, and behind was gray space, slowly\n",
      "taking form and substance. In the east there was a kindling of pale\n",
      "rose and silver that lengthened and brightened along a horizon growing\n",
      "visibly rugged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon we'd better catch up with Roy,” said Dale, and he spurred his\n",
      "horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger and Bo's mount needed no other urging, and they swung into a\n",
      "canter. Far ahead the pack-animals showed with Roy driving them. The\n",
      "cold wind was so keen in Helen's face that tears blurred her eyes and\n",
      "froze her cheeks. And riding Ranger at that pace was like riding in\n",
      "a rocking-chair. That ride, invigorating and exciting, seemed all too\n",
      "short.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell, I don't care--what becomes of--me!” exclaimed Bo,\n",
      "breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face was white and red, fresh as a rose, her eyes glanced darkly\n",
      "blue, her hair blew out in bright, unruly strands. Helen knew she felt\n",
      "some of the physical stimulation that had so roused Bo, and seemed so\n",
      "irresistible, but somber thought was not deflected thereby.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was clear daylight when Roy led off round a knoll from which patches\n",
      "of scrubby trees--cedars, Dale called them--straggled up on the side of\n",
      "the foot-hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They grow on the north slopes, where the snow stays longest,” said\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "They descended into a valley that looked shallow, but proved to be deep\n",
      "and wide, and then began to climb another foot-hill. Upon surmounting it\n",
      "Helen saw the rising sun, and so glorious a view confronted her that she\n",
      "was unable to answer Bo's wild exclamations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bare, yellow, cedar-dotted slopes, apparently level, so gradual was the\n",
      "ascent, stretched away to a dense ragged line of forest that rose\n",
      "black over range after range, at last to fail near the bare summit of a\n",
      "magnificent mountain, sunrise-flushed against the blue sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, beautiful!” cried Bo. “But they ought to be called Black\n",
      "Mountains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Baldy, there, is white half the year,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look back an' see what you say,” suggested Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls turned to gaze silently. Helen imagined she looked down upon\n",
      "the whole wide world. How vastly different was the desert! Verily it\n",
      "yawned away from her, red and gold near at hand, growing softly flushed\n",
      "with purple far away, a barren void, borderless and immense, where\n",
      "dark-green patches and black lines and upheaved ridges only served to\n",
      "emphasize distance and space.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See thet little green spot,” said Roy, pointing. “Thet's Snowdrop. An'\n",
      "the other one--'way to the right--thet's Show Down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is Pine?” queried Helen, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Farther still, up over the foot-hills at the edge of the woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then we're riding away from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. If we'd gone straight for Pine thet gang could overtake us. Pine\n",
      "is four days' ride. An' by takin' to the mountains Milt can hide his\n",
      "tracks. An' when he's thrown Anson off the scent, then he'll circle down\n",
      "to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dale, do you think you'll get us there safely--and soon?” asked\n",
      "Helen, wistfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't promise soon, but I promise safe. An' I don't like bein' called\n",
      "Mister,” he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are we ever going to eat?” inquired Bo, demurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this query Roy Beeman turned with a laugh to look at Bo. Helen saw\n",
      "his face fully in the light, and it was thin and hard, darkly bronzed,\n",
      "with eyes like those of a hawk, and with square chin and lean jaws\n",
      "showing scant, light beard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shore are,” he replied. “Soon as we reach the timber. Thet won't be\n",
      "long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon we can rustle some an' then take a good rest,” said Dale, and he\n",
      "urged his horse into a jog-trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a steady trot for a long hour, Helen's roving eyes were\n",
      "everywhere, taking note of the things from near to far--the scant sage\n",
      "that soon gave place to as scanty a grass, and the dark blots that\n",
      "proved to be dwarf cedars, and the ravines opening out as if by magic\n",
      "from what had appeared level ground, to wind away widening between gray\n",
      "stone walls, and farther on, patches of lonely pine-trees, two and three\n",
      "together, and then a straggling clump of yellow aspens, and up beyond\n",
      "the fringed border of forest, growing nearer all the while, the black\n",
      "sweeping benches rising to the noble dome of the dominant mountain of\n",
      "the range.\n",
      "\n",
      "No birds or animals were seen in that long ride up toward the timber,\n",
      "which fact seemed strange to Helen. The air lost something of its cold,\n",
      "cutting edge as the sun rose higher, and it gained sweeter tang of\n",
      "forest-land. The first faint suggestion of that fragrance was utterly\n",
      "new to Helen, yet it brought a vague sensation of familiarity and\n",
      "with it an emotion as strange. It was as if she had smelled that keen,\n",
      "pungent tang long ago, and her physical sense caught it before her\n",
      "memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellow plain had only appeared to be level. Roy led down into a\n",
      "shallow ravine, where a tiny stream meandered, and he followed this\n",
      "around to the left, coming at length to a point where cedars and\n",
      "dwarf pines formed a little grove. Here, as the others rode up, he sat\n",
      "cross-legged in his saddle, and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll hang up awhile,” he said. “Reckon you're tired?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm hungry, but not tired yet,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen dismounted, to find that walking was something she had apparently\n",
      "lost the power to do. Bo laughed at her, but she, too, was awkward when\n",
      "once more upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Roy got down. Helen was surprised to find him lame. He caught her\n",
      "quick glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A hoss threw me once an' rolled on me. Only broke my collar-bone, five\n",
      "ribs, one arm, an' my bow-legs in two places!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding this evidence that he was a cripple, as he stood there\n",
      "tall and lithe in his homespun, ragged garments, he looked singularly\n",
      "powerful and capable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon walkin' around would be good for you girls,” advised Dale. “If\n",
      "you ain't stiff yet, you'll be soon. An' walkin' will help. Don't go\n",
      "far. I'll call when breakfast's ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A little while later the girls were whistled in from their walk and\n",
      "found camp-fire and meal awaiting them. Roy was sitting cross-legged,\n",
      "like an Indian, in front of a tarpaulin, upon which was spread a homely\n",
      "but substantial fare. Helen's quick eye detected a cleanliness and\n",
      "thoroughness she had scarcely expected to find in the camp cooking of\n",
      "men of the wilds. Moreover, the fare was good. She ate heartily, and\n",
      "as for Bo's appetite, she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as\n",
      "amused at it. The young men were all eyes, assiduous in their service\n",
      "to the girls, but speaking seldom. It was not lost upon Helen how\n",
      "Dale's gray gaze went often down across the open country. She divined\n",
      "apprehension from it rather than saw much expression in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--declare,” burst out Bo, when she could not eat any more, “this\n",
      "isn't believable. I'm dreaming.... Nell, the black horse you rode is the\n",
      "prettiest I ever saw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger, with the other animals, was grazing along the little brook.\n",
      "Packs and saddles had been removed. The men ate leisurely. There\n",
      "was little evidence of hurried flight. Yet Helen could not cast off\n",
      "uneasiness. Roy might have been deep, and careless, with a motive to\n",
      "spare the girls' anxiety, but Dale seemed incapable of anything he did\n",
      "not absolutely mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rest or walk,” he advised the girls. “We've got forty miles to ride\n",
      "before dark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen preferred to rest, but Bo walked about, petting the horses and\n",
      "prying into the packs. She was curious and eager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale and Roy talked in low tones while they cleaned up the utensils and\n",
      "packed them away in a heavy canvas bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You really expect Anson 'll strike my trail this mornin'?” Dale was\n",
      "asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shore do,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' how do you figure that so soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How'd you figure it--if you was Snake Anson?” queried Roy, in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Depends on that rider from Magdalena,” Said Dale, soberly. “Although\n",
      "it's likely I'd seen them wheel tracks an' hoss tracks made where we\n",
      "turned off. But supposin' he does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, listen. I told you Snake met us boys face to face day before\n",
      "yesterday in Show Down. An' he was plumb curious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he missed seein' or hearin' about me,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe he did an' mebbe he didn't. Anyway, what's the difference whether\n",
      "he finds out this mornin' or this evenin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you ain't expectin' a fight if Anson holds up the stage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, he'd have to shoot first, which ain't likely. John an' Hal, since\n",
      "thet shootin'-scrape a year ago, have been sort of gun-shy. Joe might\n",
      "get riled. But I reckon the best we can be shore of is a delay. An' it'd\n",
      "be sense not to count on thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you hang up here an' keep watch for Anson's gang--say long enough\n",
      "so's to be sure they'd be in sight if they find our tracks this mornin'.\n",
      "Makin' sure one way or another, you ride 'cross-country to Big Spring,\n",
      "where I'll camp to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy nodded approval of that suggestion. Then without more words both men\n",
      "picked up ropes and went after the horses. Helen was watching Dale, so\n",
      "that when Bo cried out in great excitement Helen turned to see a savage\n",
      "yellow little mustang standing straight up on his hind legs and pawing\n",
      "the air. Roy had roped him and was now dragging him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, look at that for a wild pony!” exclaimed Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen busied herself getting well out of the way of the infuriated\n",
      "mustang. Roy dragged him to a cedar near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come now, Buckskin,” said Roy, soothingly, and he slowly approached the\n",
      "quivering animal. He went closer, hand over hand, on the lasso. Buckskin\n",
      "showed the whites of his eyes and also his white teeth. But he stood\n",
      "while Roy loosened the loop and, slipping it down over his head,\n",
      "fastened it in a complicated knot round his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's a hackamore,” he said, indicating the knot. “He's never had a\n",
      "bridle, an' never will have one, I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don't ride him?” queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes I do,” replied Roy, with a smile. “Would you girls like to\n",
      "try him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me,” answered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee!” ejaculated Bo. “He looks like a devil. But I'd tackle him--if you\n",
      "think I could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wild leaven of the West had found quick root in Bo Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'm sorry, but I reckon I'll not let you--for a spell,” replied\n",
      "Roy, dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He pitches somethin' powerful bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pitches. You mean bucks?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next half-hour Helen saw more and learned more about how horses\n",
      "of the open range were handled than she had ever heard of. Excepting\n",
      "Ranger, and Roy's bay, and the white pony Bo rode, the rest of the\n",
      "horses had actually to be roped and hauled into camp to be saddled and\n",
      "packed. It was a job for fearless, strong men, and one that called for\n",
      "patience as well as arms of iron. So that for Helen Rayner the thing\n",
      "succeeding the confidence she had placed in these men was respect. To an\n",
      "observing woman that half-hour told much.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all was in readiness for a start Dale mounted, and said,\n",
      "significantly: “Roy, I'll look for you about sundown. I hope no sooner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, it'd be bad if I had to rustle along soon with bad news. Let's\n",
      "hope for the best. We've been shore lucky so far. Now you take to the\n",
      "pine-mats in the woods an' hide your trail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale turned away. Then the girls bade Roy good-by, and followed. Soon\n",
      "Roy and his buckskin-colored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of\n",
      "trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unhampered horses led the way; the pack-animals trotted after them;\n",
      "the riders were close behind. All traveled at a jog-trot. And this gait\n",
      "made the packs bob up and down and from side to side. The sun felt\n",
      "warm at Helen's back and the wind lost its frosty coldness, that almost\n",
      "appeared damp, for a dry, sweet fragrance. Dale drove up the shallow\n",
      "valley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of\n",
      "timber some few miles ahead. It did not take long to reach the edge of\n",
      "the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen wondered why the big pines grew so far on that plain and no\n",
      "farther. Probably the growth had to do with snow, but, as the ground\n",
      "was level, she could not see why the edge of the woods should come just\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen it seemed a strange, critical entrance into another world,\n",
      "which she was destined to know and to love. The pines were big,\n",
      "brown-barked, seamed, and knotted, with no typical conformation except\n",
      "a majesty and beauty. They grew far apart. Few small pines and little\n",
      "underbrush flourished beneath them. The floor of this forest appeared\n",
      "remarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and\n",
      "wide brown areas of pine-needles. These manifestly were what Roy\n",
      "had meant by pine-mats. Here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or\n",
      "rotting. Helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and\n",
      "the strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all, and when\n",
      "they did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log. Likewise\n",
      "she became aware of a springy nature of the ground. And then she saw\n",
      "that the pine-mats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the\n",
      "horses, and after they had passed sprang back to place again, leaving no\n",
      "track. Helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind. Indeed,\n",
      "it would take a sharp eye to follow Dale through that forest. This\n",
      "knowledge was infinitely comforting to Helen, and for the first time\n",
      "since the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind\n",
      "and heart. It left her free for some of the appreciation she might have\n",
      "had in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo, however, seemed too young, too wild, too intense to mind what the\n",
      "circumstances were. She responded to reality. Helen began to suspect\n",
      "that the girl would welcome any adventure, and Helen knew surely now\n",
      "that Bo was a true Auchincloss. For three long days Helen had felt a\n",
      "constraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar; for the last\n",
      "hours it had been submerged under dread. But it must be, she concluded,\n",
      "blood like her sister's, pounding at her veins to be set free to race\n",
      "and to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo loved action. She had an eye for beauty, but she was not\n",
      "contemplative. She was now helping Dale drive the horses and hold them\n",
      "in rather close formation. She rode well, and as yet showed no symptoms\n",
      "of fatigue or pain. Helen began to be aware of both, but not enough yet\n",
      "to limit her interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her. Of all living\n",
      "creatures in nature Helen liked birds best, and she knew many and could\n",
      "imitate the songs of a few. But here under the stately pines there were\n",
      "no birds. Squirrels, however, began to be seen here and there, and in\n",
      "the course of an hour's travel became abundant. The only one with which\n",
      "she was familiar was the chipmunk. All the others, from the slim bright\n",
      "blacks to the striped russets and the white-tailed grays, were totally\n",
      "new to her. They appeared tame and curious. The reds barked and scolded\n",
      "at the passing cavalcade; the blacks glided to some safe branch, there\n",
      "to watch; the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their\n",
      "domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Dale, halting his horse, pointed with long arm, and Helen,\n",
      "following the direction, descried several gray deer standing in a glade,\n",
      "motionless, with long ears up. They made a wild and beautiful picture.\n",
      "Suddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forest on the whole held to the level, open character, but there\n",
      "were swales and stream-beds breaking up its regular conformity. Toward\n",
      "noon, however, it gradually changed, a fact that Helen believed she\n",
      "might have observed sooner had she been more keen. The general lay of\n",
      "the land began to ascend, and the trees to grow denser.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made another discovery. Ever since she had entered the forest she\n",
      "had become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting\n",
      "her nostrils. She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But\n",
      "presently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine\n",
      "odor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch.\n",
      "The smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength.\n",
      "Also her throat and lungs seemed to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings\n",
      "it was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied\n",
      "recognition. Thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they\n",
      "grew worse. One, especially, was a pain beyond all her experience.\n",
      "It lay in the muscles of her side, above her hip, and it grew to be a\n",
      "treacherous thing, for it was not persistent. It came and went. After it\n",
      "did come, with a terrible flash, it could be borne by shifting or easing\n",
      "the body. But it gave no warning. When she expected it she was mistaken;\n",
      "when she dared to breathe again, then, with piercing swiftness,\n",
      "it returned like a blade in her side. This, then, was one of the\n",
      "riding-pains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride. It\n",
      "was almost too much to be borne. The beauty of the forest, the living\n",
      "creatures to be seen scurrying away, the time, distance--everything\n",
      "faded before that stablike pain. To her infinite relief she found that\n",
      "it was the trot that caused this torture. When Ranger walked she did not\n",
      "have to suffer it. Therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared\n",
      "or until Dale and Bo were almost out of sight; then she loped him ahead\n",
      "until he had caught up.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the hours passed, the sun got around low, sending golden shafts\n",
      "under the trees, and the forest gradually changed to a brighter, but a\n",
      "thicker, color. This slowly darkened. Sunset was not far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard the horses splashing in water, and soon she rode up to see the\n",
      "tiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss.\n",
      "She crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a\n",
      "more open place in the forest where the pines were huge, towering,\n",
      "and far apart. A low, gray bluff of stone rose to the right, perhaps\n",
      "one-third as high as the trees. From somewhere came the rushing sound of\n",
      "running water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Big Spring,” announced Dale. “We camp here. You girls have done well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another glance proved to Helen that all those little streams poured from\n",
      "under this gray bluff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm dying for a drink,” cried Bo with her customary hyperbole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you'll never forget your first drink here,” remarked Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo essayed to dismount, and finally fell off, and when she did get to\n",
      "the ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function, and she\n",
      "fell flat. Dale helped her up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's wrong with me, anyhow?” she demanded, in great amaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just stiff, I reckon,” replied Dale, as he led her a few awkward steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, have you any hurts?” queried Helen, who still sat her horse, loath\n",
      "to try dismounting, yet wanting to beyond all words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo gave her an eloquent glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, did you have one in your side, like a wicked, long\n",
      "darning-needle, punching deep when you weren't ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That one I'll never get over!” exclaimed Helen, softly. Then, profiting\n",
      "by Bo's experience, she dismounted cautiously, and managed to keep\n",
      "upright. Her legs felt like wooden things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the girls went toward the spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drink slow,” called out Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big Spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray, weathered\n",
      "bluff, from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water.\n",
      "Its fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold\n",
      "stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen and Bo lay flat on a mossy bank, seeing their faces as they bent\n",
      "over, and they sipped a mouthful, by Dale's advice, and because they\n",
      "were so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a\n",
      "precious opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The water was so cold that it sent a shock over Helen, made her teeth\n",
      "ache, and a singular, revivifying current steal all through her,\n",
      "wonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh, irresistible\n",
      "in its appeal to thirst. Helen raised her head to look at this water. It\n",
      "was colorless as she had found it tasteless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--drink!” panted Bo. “Think of our--old spring--in the\n",
      "orchard--full of pollywogs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Helen drank thirstily, with closed eyes, while a memory of home\n",
      "stirred from Bo's gift of poignant speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER VII\n",
      "\n",
      "The first camp duty Dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the\n",
      "horses, and, opening it, he took out tarpaulin and blankets, which he\n",
      "arranged on the ground under a pine-tree.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You'll be welcome to do all you like after you're broke in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Broke in!” ejaculated Bo, with a little laugh. “I'm all broke UP now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, it looks as if Mr. Dale expects us to have quite a stay with him in\n",
      "the woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does,” replied Bo, as slowly she sat down upon the blankets,\n",
      "stretched out with a long sigh, and laid her head on a saddle. “Nell,\n",
      "didn't he say not to call him Mister?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale was throwing the packs off the other horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen lay down beside Bo, and then for once in her life she experienced\n",
      "the sweetness of rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sister, what do you intend to call him?” queried Helen,\n",
      "curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, of course,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose, then, when your Las Vegas cowboy comes along you will call\n",
      "him what he called you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo blushed, which was a rather unusual thing for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will if I like,” she retorted. “Nell, ever since I could remember\n",
      "you've raved about the West. Now you're OUT West, right in it good and\n",
      "deep. So wake up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was Bo's blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination\n",
      "of Helen's superficialities. It sank deep. Helen had no retort. Her\n",
      "ambition, as far as the West was concerned, had most assuredly not been\n",
      "for such a wild, unheard-of jaunt as this. But possibly the West--a\n",
      "living from day to day--was one succession of adventures, trials,\n",
      "tests, troubles, and achievements. To make a place for others to live\n",
      "comfortably some day! That might be Bo's meaning, embodied in her\n",
      "forceful hint. But Helen was too tired to think it out then. She found\n",
      "it interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hobbled the horses and turned them loose. Then with ax in hand he\n",
      "approached a short, dead tree, standing among a few white-barked\n",
      "aspens. Dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax. With his coat off,\n",
      "displaying his wide shoulders, straight back, and long, powerful arms,\n",
      "he looked a young giant. He was lithe and supple, brawny but not bulky.\n",
      "The ax rang on the hard wood, reverberating through the forest. A few\n",
      "strokes sufficed to bring down the stub. Then he split it up. Helen was\n",
      "curious to see how he kindled a fire. First he ripped splinters out of\n",
      "the heart of the log, and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground.\n",
      "Then from a saddlebag which hung on a near-by branch he took flint and\n",
      "steel and a piece of what Helen supposed was rag or buckskin, upon\n",
      "which powder had been rubbed. At any rate, the first strike of the steel\n",
      "brought sparks, a blaze, and burning splinters. Instantly the flame\n",
      "leaped a foot high. He put on larger pieces of wood crosswise, and the\n",
      "fire roared.\n",
      "\n",
      "That done, he stood erect, and, facing the north, he listened. Helen\n",
      "remembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before\n",
      "since the arrival at Big Spring. It was Roy for whom he was listening\n",
      "and watching. The sun had set and across the open space the tips of the\n",
      "pines were losing their brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camp utensils, which the hunter emptied out of a sack, gave forth a\n",
      "jangle of iron and tin. Next he unrolled a large pack, the contents\n",
      "of which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes. These evidently\n",
      "contained food supplies. The bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over\n",
      "it, pack and all. Dale filled it at the spring. Upon returning to the\n",
      "camp-fire he poured water into a washbasin, and, getting down to his\n",
      "knees, proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly. The act seemed a habit,\n",
      "for Helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods\n",
      "and listened. Then he dried his hands over the fire, and, turning to the\n",
      "spread-out pack, he began preparations for the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied.\n",
      "At Magdalena, on the stage-ride, and last night, she had trusted\n",
      "this stranger, a hunter of the White Mountains, who appeared ready to\n",
      "befriend her. And she had felt an exceeding gratitude. Still, she had\n",
      "looked at him impersonally. But it began to dawn upon her that chance\n",
      "had thrown her in the company of a remarkable man. That impression\n",
      "baffled her. It did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind\n",
      "to help a young woman in peril, or that he appeared deft and quick at\n",
      "camp-fire chores. Most Western men were brave, her uncle had told her,\n",
      "and many were roughly kind, and all of them could cook. This hunter was\n",
      "physically a wonderful specimen of manhood, with something leonine about\n",
      "his stature. But that did not give rise to her impression. Helen\n",
      "had been a school-teacher and used to boys, and she sensed a boyish\n",
      "simplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter. She believed, however,\n",
      "that it was a mental and spiritual force in Dale which had drawn her to\n",
      "think of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I've spoken to you three times,” protested Bo, petulantly. “What\n",
      "'re you mooning over?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm pretty tired--and far away, Bo,” replied Helen. “What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said I had an e-normous appetite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really. That's not remarkable for you. I'm too tired to eat. And afraid\n",
      "to shut my eyes. They'd never come open. When did we sleep last, Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Second night before we left home,” declared Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four nights! Oh, we've slept some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet I make mine up in this woods. Do you suppose we'll sleep right\n",
      "here--under this tree--with no covering?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks so,” replied Helen, dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How perfectly lovely!” exclaimed Bo, in delight. “We'll see the stars\n",
      "through the pines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seems to be clouding over. Wouldn't it be awful if we had a storm?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I don't know,” answered Bo, thoughtfully. “It must storm out\n",
      "West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Helen felt a quality of inevitableness in Bo. It was something\n",
      "that had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St. Joseph.\n",
      "All of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thought--a thrilling\n",
      "consciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop in a new and wild\n",
      "environment. How strange, and fearful, perhaps, to watch that growth!\n",
      "Bo, being younger, more impressionable, with elemental rather than\n",
      "intellectual instincts, would grow stronger more swiftly. Helen wondered\n",
      "if she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive. But how could\n",
      "anyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way? It was the\n",
      "savage who did not think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen saw Dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon Roy ain't comin',” he soliloquized. “An' that's good.” Then he\n",
      "turned to the girls. “Supper's ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity. And\n",
      "they ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods. Dale\n",
      "attended them with a pleasant light upon his still face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To-morrow night we'll have meat,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wild turkey or deer. Maybe both, if you like. But it's well to take\n",
      "wild meat slow. An' turkey--that 'll melt in your mouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uummm!” murmured Bo, greedily. “I've heard of wild turkey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had finished Dale ate his meal, listening to the talk of the\n",
      "girls, and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bo's. It was\n",
      "twilight when he began to wash the pots and pans, and almost dark by the\n",
      "time his duties appeared ended. Then he replenished the campfire and\n",
      "sat down on a log to gaze into the fire. The girls leaned comfortably\n",
      "propped against the saddles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll keel over in a minute,” said Bo. “And I oughtn't--right on\n",
      "such a big supper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't see how I can sleep, and I know I can't stay awake,” rejoined\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale lifted his head alertly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls grew tense and still. Helen could not hear a sound, unless it\n",
      "was a low thud of hoof out in the gloom. The forest seemed sleeping. She\n",
      "knew from Bo's eyes, wide and shining in the camp-fire light, that she,\n",
      "too, had failed to catch whatever it was Dale meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bunch of coyotes comin',” he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy, high-strung, strange\n",
      "barks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or\n",
      "inquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at the\n",
      "edge of the circle of light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded\n",
      "the camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a\n",
      "restless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after\n",
      "the chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes\n",
      "went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence again settled down. If it had not been for the anxiety always\n",
      "present in Helen's mind she would have thought this silence sweet and\n",
      "unfamiliarly beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Listen to that fellow,” spoke up Dale. His voice was thrilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the girls strained their ears. That was not necessary, for\n",
      "presently, clear and cold out of the silence, pealed a mournful howl,\n",
      "long drawn, strange and full and wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! What's that?” whispered Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's a big gray wolf--a timber-wolf, or lofer, as he's sometimes\n",
      "called,” replied Dale. “He's high on some rocky ridge back there. He\n",
      "scents us, an' he doesn't like it.... There he goes again. Listen! Ah,\n",
      "he's hungry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Helen listened to this exceedingly wild cry--so wild that it made\n",
      "her flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come\n",
      "over her--she kept her glance upon Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You love him?” she murmured involuntarily, quite without understanding\n",
      "the motive of her query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly Dale had never had that question asked of him before, and\n",
      "it seemed to Helen, as he pondered, that he had never even asked it of\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon so,” he replied, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But wolves kill deer, and little fawns, and everything helpless in the\n",
      "forest,” expostulated Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter nodded his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, then, can you love him?” repeated Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come to think of it, I reckon it's because of lots of reasons,”\n",
      " returned Dale. “He kills clean. He eats no carrion. He's no coward. He\n",
      "fights. He dies game.... An' he likes to be alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kills clean. What do you mean by that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A cougar, now, he mangles a deer. An' a silvertip, when killin' a\n",
      "cow or colt, he makes a mess of it. But a wolf kills clean, with sharp\n",
      "snaps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are a cougar and a silvertip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cougar means mountain-lion or panther, an' a silvertip is a grizzly\n",
      "bear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, they're all cruel!” exclaimed Helen, shrinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon. Often I've shot wolves for relayin' a deer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer, an' while one of them\n",
      "rests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner, who'll, take\n",
      "up the chase. That way they run the deer down. Cruel it is, but nature,\n",
      "an' no worse than snow an' ice that starve deer, or a fox that kills\n",
      "turkey-chicks breakin' out of the egg, or ravens that pick the eyes out\n",
      "of new-born lambs an' wait till they die. An' for that matter, men are\n",
      "crueler than beasts of prey, for men add to nature, an' have more than\n",
      "instincts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was silenced, as well as shocked. She had not only learned a new\n",
      "and striking viewpoint in natural history, but a clear intimation to the\n",
      "reason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in\n",
      "this man. A hunter was one who killed animals for their fur, for their\n",
      "meat or horns, or for some lust for blood--that was Helen's definition\n",
      "of a hunter, and she believed it was held by the majority of people\n",
      "living in settled states. But the majority might be wrong. A hunter\n",
      "might be vastly different, and vastly more than a tracker and slayer\n",
      "of game. The mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men.\n",
      "Perhaps Dale knew its secrets, its life, its terror, its beauty, its\n",
      "sadness, and its joy; and if so, how full, how wonderful must be his\n",
      "mind! He spoke of men as no better than wolves. Could a lonely life\n",
      "in the wilderness teach a man that? Bitterness, envy, jealousy, spite,\n",
      "greed, and hate--these had no place in this hunter's heart. It was not\n",
      "Helen's shrewdness, but a woman's intuition, which divined that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale rose to his feet and, turning his ear to the north, listened once\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you expecting Roy still?” inquired Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it ain't likely he'll turn up to-night,” replied Dale, and then he\n",
      "strode over to put a hand on the pine-tree that soared above where the\n",
      "girls lay. His action, and the way he looked up at the tree-top and then\n",
      "at adjacent trees, held more of that significance which so interested\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon he's stood there some five hundred years an' will stand\n",
      "through to-night,” muttered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pine was the monarch of that wide-spread group.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen again,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was asleep. And Helen, listening, at once caught low, distant roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wind. It's goin' to storm,” explained Dale. “You'll hear somethin'\n",
      "worth while. But don't be scared. Reckon we'll be safe. Pines blow down\n",
      "often. But this fellow will stand any fall wind that ever was.... Better\n",
      "slip under the blankets so I can pull the tarp up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen slid down, just as she was, fully dressed except for boots, which\n",
      "she and Bo had removed; and she laid her head close to Bo's. Dale pulled\n",
      "the tarpaulin up and folded it back just below their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When it rains you'll wake, an' then just pull the tarp up over you,” he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will it rain?” Helen asked. But she was thinking that this moment\n",
      "was the strangest that had ever happened to her. By the light of the\n",
      "camp-fire she saw Dale's face, just as usual, still, darkly serene,\n",
      "expressing no thought. He was kind, but he was not thinking of these\n",
      "sisters as girls, alone with him in a pitch-black forest, helpless and\n",
      "defenseless. He did not seem to be thinking at all. But Helen had never\n",
      "before in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be close by an' keep the fire goin' all night,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard him stride off into the darkness. Presently there came a\n",
      "dragging, bumping sound, then a crash of a log dropped upon the fire.\n",
      "A cloud of sparks shot up, and many pattered down to hiss upon the damp\n",
      "ground. Smoke again curled upward along the great, seamed tree-trunk,\n",
      "and flames sputtered and crackled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen listened again for the roar of wind. It seemed to come on a breath\n",
      "of air that fanned her cheek and softly blew Bo's curls, and it was\n",
      "stronger. But it died out presently, only to come again, and still\n",
      "stronger. Helen realized then that the sound was that of an approaching\n",
      "storm. Her heavy eyelids almost refused to stay open, and she knew if\n",
      "she let them close she would instantly drop to sleep. And she wanted to\n",
      "hear the storm-wind in the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few drops of cold rain fell upon her face, thrilling her with the\n",
      "proof that no roof stood between her and the elements. Then a breeze\n",
      "bore the smell of burnt wood into her face, and somehow her quick mind\n",
      "flew to girlhood days when she burned brush and leaves with her little\n",
      "brothers. The memory faded. The roar that had seemed distant was now\n",
      "back in the forest, coming swiftly, increasing in volume. Like a\n",
      "stream in flood it bore down. Helen grew amazed, startled. How rushing,\n",
      "oncoming, and heavy this storm-wind! She likened its approach to the\n",
      "tread of an army. Then the roar filled the forest, yet it was back there\n",
      "behind her. Not a pine-needle quivered in the light of the camp-fire.\n",
      "But the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge. The roar\n",
      "augmented till it was no longer a roar, but an on-sweeping crash, like\n",
      "an ocean torrent engulfing the earth. Bo awoke to cling to Helen\n",
      "with fright. The deafening storm-blast was upon them. Helen felt the\n",
      "saddle-pillow move under her head. The giant pine had trembled to its\n",
      "very roots. That mighty fury of wind was all aloft, in the tree-tops.\n",
      "And for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power.\n",
      "Then the deafening crash passed to roar, and that swept on and on,\n",
      "lessening in volume, deepening in low detonation, at last to die in the\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and\n",
      "ceased and rose again. Helen lay there, whispering to Bo, and heard\n",
      "again the great wave of wind come and crash and cease. That was the way\n",
      "of this storm-wind of the mountain forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned Helen to remember Dale's\n",
      "directions, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike\n",
      "over the saddle. Then, with Bo close and warm beside her, she closed\n",
      "her eyes, and the sense of the black forest and the wind and rain\n",
      "faded. Last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the\n",
      "tarpaulin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When she opened her eyes she remembered everything, as if only a moment\n",
      "had elapsed. But it was daylight, though gray and cloudy. The pines were\n",
      "dripping mist. A fire crackled cheerily and blue smoke curled upward and\n",
      "a savory odor of hot coffee hung in the air. Horses were standing\n",
      "near by, biting and kicking at one another. Bo was sound asleep. Dale\n",
      "appeared busy around the camp-fire. As Helen watched the hunter she\n",
      "saw him pause in his task, turn his ear to listen, and then look\n",
      "expectantly. And at that juncture a shout pealed from the forest.\n",
      "Helen recognized Roy's voice. Then she heard a splashing of water, and\n",
      "hoof-beats coming closer. With that the buckskin mustang trotted into\n",
      "camp, carrying Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad mornin' for ducks, but good for us,” he called.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Roy!” greeted Dale, and his gladness was unmistakable. “I was\n",
      "lookin' for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy appeared to slide off the mustang without effort, and his swift\n",
      "hands slapped the straps as he unsaddled. Buckskin was wet with sweat\n",
      "and foam mixed with rain. He heaved. And steam rose from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must have rode hard,” observed Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shore did,” replied Roy. Then he espied Helen, who had sat up, with\n",
      "hands to her hair, and eyes staring at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mornin', miss. It's good news.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank Heaven!” murmured Helen, and then she shook Bo. That young lady\n",
      "awoke, but was loath to give up slumber. “Bo! Bo! Wake up! Mr. Roy is\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Bo sat up, disheveled and sleepy-eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh-h, but I ache!” she moaned. But her eyes took in the camp scene to\n",
      "the effect that she added, “Is breakfast ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Almost. An' flapjacks this mornin',” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo manifested active symptoms of health in the manner with which she\n",
      "laced her boots. Helen got their traveling-bag, and with this they\n",
      "repaired to a flat stone beside the spring, not, however, out of earshot\n",
      "of the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long are you goin' to hang around camp before tellin' me?” inquired\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jest as I figgered, Milt,” replied Roy. “Thet rider who passed you was\n",
      "a messenger to Anson. He an' his gang got on our trail quick. About ten\n",
      "o'clock I seen them comin'. Then I lit out for the woods. I stayed off\n",
      "in the woods close enough to see where they come in. An' shore they\n",
      "lost your trail. Then they spread through the woods, workin' off to the\n",
      "south, thinkin', of course, thet you would circle round to Pine on the\n",
      "south side of Old Baldy. There ain't a hoss-tracker in Snake Anson's\n",
      "gang, thet's shore. Wal, I follered them for an hour till they'd rustled\n",
      "some miles off our trail. Then I went back to where you struck into\n",
      "the woods. An' I waited there all afternoon till dark, expectin' mebbe\n",
      "they'd back-trail. But they didn't. I rode on a ways an' camped in the\n",
      "woods till jest before daylight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far so good,” declared Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. There's rough country south of Baldy an' along the two or three\n",
      "trails Anson an' his outfit will camp, you bet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't to be thought of,” muttered Dale, at some idea that had struck\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What ain't?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goin' round the north side of Baldy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It shore ain't,” rejoined Roy, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I've got to hide tracks certain--rustle to my camp an' stay there\n",
      "till you say it's safe to risk takin' the girls to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, you're talkin' the wisdom of the prophets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ain't so sure we can hide tracks altogether. If Anson had any eyes\n",
      "for the woods he'd not have lost me so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But, you see, he's figgerin' to cross your trail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an' hide tracks\n",
      "certain, I'd feel safe from pursuit, anyway,” said the hunter,\n",
      "reflectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore an' easy,” responded Roy, quickly. “I jest met up with some\n",
      "greaser sheep-herders drivin' a big flock. They've come up from the\n",
      "south an' are goin' to fatten up at Turkey Senacas. Then they'll drive\n",
      "back south an' go on to Phenix. Wal, it's muddy weather. Now you break\n",
      "camp quick an' make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail, as if you\n",
      "was travelin' south. But, instead, you ride round ahead of thet flock of\n",
      "sheep. They'll keep to the open parks an' the trails through them necks\n",
      "of woods out here. An', passin' over your tracks, they'll hide 'em.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But supposin' Anson circles an' hits this camp? He'll track me easy out\n",
      "to that sheep trail. What then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jest what you want. Goin' south thet sheep trail is downhill an' muddy.\n",
      "It's goin' to rain hard. Your tracks would get washed out even if you\n",
      "did go south. An' Anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the\n",
      "scent. Leave it to me, Milt. You're a hunter. But I'm a hoss-tracker.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right. We'll rustle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he called the girls to hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII\n",
      "\n",
      "Once astride the horse again, Helen had to congratulate herself upon not\n",
      "being so crippled as she had imagined. Indeed, Bo made all the audible\n",
      "complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both girls had long water-proof coats, brand-new, and of which they were\n",
      "considerably proud. New clothes had not been a common event in their\n",
      "lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I'll have to slit these,” Dale had said, whipping out a huge\n",
      "knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” had been Bo's feeble protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They wasn't made for ridin'. An' you'll get wet enough even if I do cut\n",
      "them. An' if I don't, you'll get soaked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go ahead,” had been Helen's reluctant permission.\n",
      "\n",
      "So their long new coats were slit half-way up the back. The exigency of\n",
      "the case was manifest to Helen, when she saw how they came down over the\n",
      "cantles of the saddles and to their boot-tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was gray and cold. A fine, misty rain fell and the trees\n",
      "dripped steadily. Helen was surprised to see the open country again and\n",
      "that apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while. The\n",
      "country was wide and flat on the right, and to the left it rolled and\n",
      "heaved along a black, scalloped timber-line. Above this bordering of\n",
      "the forest low, drifting clouds obscured the mountains. The wind was at\n",
      "Helen's back and seemed to be growing stronger. Dale and Roy were ahead,\n",
      "traveling at a good trot, with the pack-animals bunched before them.\n",
      "Helen and Bo had enough to do to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first hour's ride brought little change in weather or scenery, but\n",
      "it gave Helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up\n",
      "all day. She began to welcome the places where the horses walked, but\n",
      "she disliked the levels. As for the descents, she hated those. Ranger\n",
      "would not go down slowly and the shake-up she received was unpleasant.\n",
      "Moreover, the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and\n",
      "washes. He sailed over them like a bird. Helen could not acquire the\n",
      "knack of sitting the saddle properly, and so, not only was her person\n",
      "bruised on these occasions, but her feelings were hurt. Helen had\n",
      "never before been conscious of vanity. Still, she had never rejoiced\n",
      "in looking at a disadvantage, and her exhibitions here must have been\n",
      "frightful. Bo always would forge to the front, and she seldom looked\n",
      "back, for which Helen was grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long they struck into a broad, muddy belt, full of innumerable\n",
      "small hoof tracks. This, then, was the sheep trail Roy had advised\n",
      "following. They rode on it for three or four miles, and at length,\n",
      "coming to a gray-green valley, they saw a huge flock of sheep. Soon the\n",
      "air was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep, and a\n",
      "low, soft roar of pattering hoofs. The flock held a compact formation,\n",
      "covering several acres, and grazed along rapidly. There were three\n",
      "herders on horses and several pack-burros. Dale engaged one of the\n",
      "Mexicans in conversation, and passed something to him, then pointed\n",
      "northward and down along the trail. The Mexican grinned from ear to ear,\n",
      "and Helen caught the quick “SI, SENOR! GRACIAS, SENOR!” It was a pretty\n",
      "sight, that flock of sheep, as it rolled along like a rounded woolly\n",
      "stream of grays and browns and here and there a black. They were keeping\n",
      "to a trail over the flats. Dale headed into this trail and, if anything,\n",
      "trotted a little faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the clouds lifted and broke, showing blue sky and one streak\n",
      "of sunshine. But the augury was without warrant. The wind increased. A\n",
      "huge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that\n",
      "could be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a\n",
      "swiftly moving wall. Soon it enveloped the fugitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "With head bowed, Helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold, gray\n",
      "rain that blew almost on a level. Finally the heavy downpour passed,\n",
      "leaving a fine mist. The clouds scurried low and dark, hiding the\n",
      "mountains altogether and making the gray, wet plain a dreary sight.\n",
      "Helen's feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water. And\n",
      "they were cold. Her gloves, too, had not been intended for rain, and\n",
      "they were wet through. The cold bit at her fingers so that she had to\n",
      "beat her hands together. Ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was\n",
      "to trot faster, which event was worse for Helen than freezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw another black, scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its\n",
      "trailing sheets of rain, and this one appeared streaked with white.\n",
      "Snow! The wind was now piercingly cold. Helen's body kept warm, but\n",
      "her extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly. She gazed ahead\n",
      "grimly. There was no help; she had to go on. Dale and Roy were hunched\n",
      "down in their saddles, probably wet through, for they wore no rain-proof\n",
      "coats. Bo kept close behind them, and plain it was that she felt the\n",
      "cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second storm was not so bad as the first, because there was less\n",
      "rain. Still, the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow. It lasted\n",
      "for an hour, during which the horses trotted on, trotted on. Again the\n",
      "gray torrent roared away, the fine mist blew, the clouds lifted and\n",
      "separated, and, closing again, darkened for another onslaught. This one\n",
      "brought sleet. The driving pellets stung Helen's neck and cheeks, and\n",
      "for a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was\n",
      "afraid she could not hold up under them. The bare places on the ground\n",
      "showed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, storm after storm rolled over Helen's head. Her feet grew numb\n",
      "and ceased to hurt. But her fingers, because of her ceaseless efforts\n",
      "to keep up the circulation, retained the stinging pain. And now the wind\n",
      "pierced right through her. She marveled at her endurance, and there were\n",
      "many times that she believed she could not ride farther. Yet she kept\n",
      "on. All the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as\n",
      "this. Hard and cold, wet and windy, at an increasing elevation--that was\n",
      "the explanation. The air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, during all those interminable hours, Helen watched where she was\n",
      "traveling, and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize\n",
      "it. The afternoon appeared far advanced when Dale and Roy led down into\n",
      "an immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats. They rode\n",
      "along its margin, splashing up to the knees of the horses. Cranes and\n",
      "herons flew on with lumbering motion; flocks of ducks winged swift\n",
      "flight from one side to the other. Beyond this depression the land\n",
      "sloped rather abruptly; outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of\n",
      "the highest ground, and again a dark fringe of trees appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many miles! wondered Helen. They seemed as many and as long as\n",
      "the hours. But at last, just as another hard rain came, the pines\n",
      "were reached. They proved to be widely scattered and afforded little\n",
      "protection from the storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen sat her saddle, a dead weight. Whenever Ranger quickened his gait\n",
      "or crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling\n",
      "off. Her mind harbored only sensations of misery, and a persistent\n",
      "thought--why did she ever leave home for the West? Her solicitude for Bo\n",
      "had been forgotten. Nevertheless, any marked change in the topography\n",
      "of the country was registered, perhaps photographed on her memory by the\n",
      "torturing vividness of her experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forest grew more level and denser. Shadows of twilight or gloom lay\n",
      "under the trees. Presently Dale and Roy, disappeared, going downhill,\n",
      "and likewise Bo. Then Helen's ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid\n",
      "water. Ranger trotted faster. Soon Helen came to the edge of a great\n",
      "valley, black and gray, so full of obscurity that she could not see\n",
      "across or down into it. But she knew there was a rushing river at\n",
      "the bottom. The sound was deep, continuous, a heavy, murmuring roar,\n",
      "singularly musical. The trail was steep. Helen had not lost all feeling,\n",
      "as she had believed and hoped. Her poor, mistreated body still responded\n",
      "excruciatingly to concussions, jars, wrenches, and all the other\n",
      "horrible movements making up a horse-trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "For long Helen did not look up. When she did so there lay a green,\n",
      "willow-bordered, treeless space at the bottom of the valley, through\n",
      "which a brown-white stream rushed with steady, ear-filling roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale and Roy drove the pack-animals across the stream, and followed,\n",
      "going deep to the flanks of their horses. Bo rode into the foaming water\n",
      "as if she had been used to it all her days. A slip, a fall, would have\n",
      "meant that Bo must drown in that mountain torrent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger trotted straight to the edge, and there, obedient to Helen's\n",
      "clutch on the bridle, he halted. The stream was fifty feet wide, shallow\n",
      "on the near side, deep on the opposite, with fast current and big waves.\n",
      "Helen was simply too frightened to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him come!” yelled Dale. “Stick on now!... Ranger!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The big black plunged in, making the water fly. That stream was nothing\n",
      "for him, though it seemed impassable to Helen. She had not the strength\n",
      "left to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them. Ranger, in two\n",
      "more plunges, surmounted the bank, and then, trotting across the green\n",
      "to where the other horses stood steaming under some pines, he gave a\n",
      "great heave and halted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy reached up to help her off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty miles, Miss Helen,” he said, and the way he spoke was a\n",
      "compliment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to lift her off and help her to the tree where Bo leaned. Dale\n",
      "had ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddle-blankets on the ground\n",
      "under the pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--you swore--you loved me!” was Bo's mournful greeting. The girl\n",
      "was pale, drawn, blue-lipped, and she could not stand up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I never did--or I'd never have brought you to this--wretch that I\n",
      "am!” cried Helen. “Oh, what a horrible ride!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rain was falling, the trees were dripping, the sky was lowering. All the\n",
      "ground was soaking wet, with pools and puddles everywhere. Helen could\n",
      "imagine nothing but a heartless, dreary, cold prospect. Just then home\n",
      "was vivid and poignant in her thoughts. Indeed, so utterly miserable\n",
      "was she that the exquisite relief of sitting down, of a cessation of\n",
      "movement, of a release from that infernal perpetual-trotting horse,\n",
      "seemed only a mockery. It could not be true that the time had come for\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheep-herders,\n",
      "for there were remains of a fire. Dale lifted the burnt end of a log\n",
      "and brought it down hard upon the ground, splitting off pieces. Several\n",
      "times he did this. It was amazing to see his strength, his facility, as\n",
      "he split off handfuls of splinters. He collected a bundle of them, and,\n",
      "laying them down, he bent over them. Roy wielded the ax on another log,\n",
      "and each stroke split off a long strip. Then a tiny column of smoke\n",
      "drifted up over Dale's shoulder as he leaned, bareheaded, sheltering the\n",
      "splinters with his hat. A blaze leaped up. Roy came with an armful of\n",
      "strips all white and dry, out of the inside of a log. Crosswise these\n",
      "were laid over the blaze, and it began to roar. Then piece by piece the\n",
      "men built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods, branches\n",
      "and stumps and logs, erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke\n",
      "roared upward. It had not taken two minutes. Already Helen felt the\n",
      "warmth on her icy face. She held up her bare, numb hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Dale and Roy were wet through to the skin, yet they did not tarry\n",
      "beside the fire. They relieved the horses. A lasso went up between two\n",
      "pines, and a tarpaulin over it, V-shaped and pegged down at the four\n",
      "ends. The packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and\n",
      "bedding were placed under this shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen thought this might have taken five minutes more. In this short\n",
      "space of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot.\n",
      "Rain was falling steadily all around, but over and near that roaring\n",
      "blaze, ten feet high, no water fell. It evaporated. The ground began to\n",
      "steam and to dry. Helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out\n",
      "the cold. But presently the pain ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I never knew before how good a fire could feel,” declared Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therein lay more food for Helen's reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ten minutes Helen was dry and hot. Darkness came down upon the\n",
      "dreary, sodden forest, but that great camp-fire made it a different\n",
      "world from the one Helen had anticipated. It blazed and roared, cracked\n",
      "like a pistol, hissed and sputtered, shot sparks everywhere, and sent\n",
      "aloft a dense, yellow, whirling column of smoke. It began to have a\n",
      "heart of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the\n",
      "coffee-pot and oven soon began to steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, I promised the girls turkey to-night,” said the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe to-morrow, if the wind shifts. This 's turkey country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, a potato will do me!” exclaimed Bo. “Never again will I ask for\n",
      "cake and pie! I never appreciated good things to eat. And I've been a\n",
      "little pig, always. I never--never knew what it was to be hungry--until\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale glanced up quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lass, it's worth learnin',” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's thought was too deep for words. In such brief space had she been\n",
      "transformed from misery to comfort!\n",
      "\n",
      "The rain kept on falling, though it appeared to grow softer as night\n",
      "settled down black. The wind died away and the forest was still, except\n",
      "for the steady roar of the stream. A folded tarpaulin was laid between\n",
      "the pine and the fire, well in the light and warmth, and upon it the\n",
      "men set steaming pots and plates and cups, the fragrance from which was\n",
      "strong and inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fetch the saddle-blanket an' set with your backs to the fire,” said\n",
      "Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and\n",
      "sheltered from the rain, Helen remained awake after Bo had fallen\n",
      "asleep. The big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day. She\n",
      "could see the smoke, the trunk of the big pine towering aloft, and\n",
      "a blank space of sky. The stream hummed a song, seemingly musical at\n",
      "times, and then discordant and dull, now low, now roaring, and always\n",
      "rushing, gurgling, babbling, flowing, chafing in its hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses,\n",
      "and beside the fire they conversed in low tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet trail we made to-day will be hid, I reckon,” said Roy, with\n",
      "satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What wasn't sheeped over would be washed out. We've had luck. An' now I\n",
      "ain't worryin',” returned Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Worryin'? Then it's the first I ever knowed you to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man, I never had a job like this,” protested the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet's so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Roy, when old Al Auchincloss finds out about this deal, as he's\n",
      "bound to when you or the boys get back to Pine, he's goin' to roar.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Those words, sad and deep, ended the conversation. Again the rumbling,\n",
      "rushing stream dominated the forest. An owl hooted dismally. A horse\n",
      "trod thuddingly near by and from that direction came a cutting tear of\n",
      "teeth on grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A voice pierced Helen's deep dreams and, awaking, she found Bo shaking\n",

      "\n",
      "“Are you dead?” came the gay voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Almost. Oh, my back's broken,” replied Helen. The desire to move seemed\n",
      "clamped in a vise, and even if that came she believed the effort would\n",
      "be impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy called us,” said Bo. “He said hurry. I thought I'd die just sitting\n",
      "up, and I'd give you a million dollars to lace my boots. Wait, sister,\n",
      "till you try to pull on one of those stiff boots!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With heroic and violent spirit Helen sat up to find that in the act\n",
      "her aches and pains appeared beyond number. Reaching for her boots,\n",
      "she found them cold and stiff. Helen unlaced one and, opening it wide,\n",
      "essayed to get her sore foot down into it. But her foot appeared swollen\n",
      "and the boot appeared shrunken. She could not get it half on, though\n",
      "she expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms. She\n",
      "groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo laughed wickedly. Her hair was tousled, her eyes dancing, her cheeks\n",
      "red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be game!” she said. “Stand up like a real Western girl and PULL your\n",
      "boot on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Bo's scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to\n",
      "Helen, but the fact was that she got into her boots. Walking and\n",
      "moving a little appeared to loosen the stiff joints and ease that tired\n",
      "feeling. The water of the stream where the girls washed was colder than\n",
      "any ice Helen had ever felt. It almost paralyzed her hands. Bo mumbled,\n",
      "and blew like a porpoise. They had to run to the fire before being able\n",
      "to comb their hair. The air was wonderfully keen. The dawn was clear,\n",
      "bright, with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All ready, girls,” called Roy. “Reckon you can help yourselves. Milt\n",
      "ain't comin' in very fast with the hosses. I'll rustle off to help him.\n",
      "We've got a hard day before us. Yesterday wasn't nowhere to what to-day\n",
      "'ll be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the sun's going to shine?” implored Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you bet,” rejoined Roy, as he strode off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen and Bo ate breakfast and had the camp to themselves for perhaps\n",
      "half an hour; then the horses came thudding down, with Dale and Roy\n",
      "riding bareback.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time all was in readiness to start the sun was up, melting the\n",
      "frost and ice, so that a dazzling, bright mist, full of rainbows, shone\n",
      "under the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale looked Ranger over, and tried the cinches of Bo's horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's your choice--a long ride behind the packs with me--or a short\n",
      "cut over the hills with Roy?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I choose the lesser of two rides,” replied Helen, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon that 'll be easier, but you'll know you've had a ride,” said\n",
      "Dale, significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that we had yesterday?” asked Bo, archly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only thirty miles, but cold an' wet. To-day will be fine for ridin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I'll take a blanket an' some grub in case you don't meet us\n",
      "to-night,” said Roy. “An' I reckon we'll split up here where I'll have\n",
      "to strike out on thet short cut.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo mounted without a helping hand, but Helen's limbs were so stiff that\n",
      "she could not get astride the high Ranger without assistance. The hunter\n",
      "headed up the slope of the canyon, which on that side was not steep.\n",
      "It was brown pine forest, with here and there a clump of dark,\n",
      "silver-pointed evergreens that Roy called spruce. By the time this slope\n",
      "was surmounted Helen's aches were not so bad. The saddle appeared to\n",
      "fit her better, and the gait of the horse was not so unfamiliar. She\n",
      "reflected, however, that she always had done pretty well uphill. Here it\n",
      "was beautiful forest-land, uneven and wilder. They rode for a time along\n",
      "the rim, with the white rushing stream in plain sight far below, with\n",
      "its melodious roar ever thrumming in the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale reined in and peered down at the pine-mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fresh deer sign all along here,” he said, pointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I seen thet long ago,” rejoined Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's scrutiny was rewarded by descrying several tiny depressions in\n",
      "the pine-needles, dark in color and sharply defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may never get a better chance,” said Dale. “Those deer are workin'\n",
      "up our way. Get your rifle out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel was resumed then, with Roy a little in advance of the pack-train.\n",
      "Presently he dismounted, threw his bridle, and cautiously peered ahead.\n",
      "Then, turning, he waved his sombrero. The pack-animals halted in a\n",
      "bunch. Dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode up to Roy's horse.\n",
      "This point, Helen saw, was at the top of an intersecting canuon. Dale\n",
      "dismounted, without drawing his rifle from its saddle-sheath, and\n",
      "approached Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Buck an' two does,” he said, low-voiced. “An' they've winded us, but\n",
      "don't see us yet.... Girls, ride up closer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the directions indicated by Dale's long arm, Helen looked down\n",
      "the slope. It was open, with tall pines here and there, and clumps of\n",
      "silver spruce, and aspens shining like gold in the morning sunlight.\n",
      "Presently Bo exclaimed: “Oh, look! I see! I see!” Then Helen's roving\n",
      "glance passed something different from green and gold and brown.\n",
      "Shifting back to it she saw a magnificent stag, with noble spreading\n",
      "antlers, standing like a statue, his head up in alert and wild posture.\n",
      "His color was gray. Beside him grazed two deer of slighter and more\n",
      "graceful build, without horns.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's downhill,” whispered Dale. “An' you're goin' to overshoot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen saw that Roy had his rifle leveled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don't!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's remark evidently nettled Roy. He lowered the rifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, it's me lookin' over this gun. How can you stand there an' tell\n",
      "me I'm goin' to shoot high? I had a dead bead on him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, you didn't allow for downhill... Hurry. He sees us now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy leveled the rifle and, taking aim as before, he fired. The buck\n",
      "stood perfectly motionless, as if he had indeed been stone. The does,\n",
      "however, jumped with a start, and gazed in fright in every direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Told you! I seen where your bullet hit thet pine--half a foot over his\n",
      "shoulder. Try again an' aim at his legs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy now took a quicker aim and pulled trigger. A puff of dust right at\n",
      "the feet of the buck showed where Roy's lead had struck this time. With\n",
      "a single bound, wonderful to see, the big deer was out of sight behind\n",
      "trees and brush. The does leaped after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doggone the luck!” ejaculated Roy, red in the face, as he worked the\n",
      "lever of his rifle. “Never could shoot downhill, nohow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "His rueful apology to the girls for missing brought a merry laugh from\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for worlds would I have had you kill that beautiful deer!” she\n",
      "exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We won't have venison steak off him, that's certain,” remarked Dale,\n",
      "dryly. “An' maybe none off any deer, if Roy does the shootin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They resumed travel, sheering off to the right and keeping to the edge\n",
      "of the intersecting canuon. At length they rode down to the bottom,\n",
      "where a tiny brook babbled through willows, and they followed this for\n",
      "a mile or so down to where it flowed into the larger stream. A dim trail\n",
      "overgrown with grass showed at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's where we part,” said Dale. “You'll beat me into my camp, but\n",
      "I'll get there sometime after dark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey, Milt, I forgot about thet darned pet cougar of yours an' the rest\n",
      "of your menagerie. Reckon they won't scare the girls? Especially old\n",
      "Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't see Tom till I get home,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain't he corralled or tied up?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. He has the run of the place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, good-by, then, an' rustle along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale nodded to the girls, and, turning his horse, he drove the\n",
      "pack-train before him up the open space between the stream and the\n",
      "wooded slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy stepped off his horse with that single action which appeared such a\n",
      "feat to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guess I'd better cinch up,” he said, as he threw a stirrup up over the\n",
      "pommel of his saddle. “You girls are goin' to see wild country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's old Tom?” queried Bo, curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, he's Milt's pet cougar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cougar? That's a panther--a mountain-lion, didn't he say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore is. Tom is a beauty. An' if he takes a likin' to you he'll love\n",
      "you, play with you, maul you half to death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was all eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale has other pets, too?” she questioned, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never was up to his camp but what it was overrun with birds an'\n",
      "squirrels an' vermin of all kinds, as tame as tame as cows. Too darn\n",
      "tame, Milt says. But I can't figger thet. You girls will never want to\n",
      "leave thet senaca of his.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's a senaca?” asked Helen, as she shifted her foot to let him\n",
      "tighten the cinches on her saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's Mexican for park, I guess,” he replied. “These mountains are\n",
      "full of parks; an', say, I don't ever want to see no prettier place till\n",
      "I get to heaven.... There, Ranger, old boy, thet's tight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He slapped the horse affectionately, and, turning to his own, he stepped\n",
      "and swung his long length up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't deep crossin' here. Come on,” he called, and spurred his bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stream here was wide and it looked deep, but turned out to be\n",
      "deceptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, girls, here beginneth the second lesson,” he drawled, cheerily.\n",
      "“Ride one behind the other--stick close to me--do what I do--an' holler\n",
      "when you want to rest or if somethin' goes bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he spurred into the thicket. Bo went next and Helen followed.\n",
      "The willows dragged at her so hard that she was unable to watch Roy, and\n",
      "the result was that a low-sweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard\n",
      "on the head. It hurt and startled her, and roused her mettle. Roy was\n",
      "keeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well, and he led up\n",
      "a slope to the open pine forest. Here the ride for several miles was\n",
      "straight, level, and open. Helen liked the forest to-day. It was brown\n",
      "and green, with patches of gold where the sun struck. She saw her first\n",
      "bird--big blue grouse that whirred up from under her horse, and little\n",
      "checkered gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing. Several times\n",
      "Roy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle, and often\n",
      "when he pointed Helen was not quick enough to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of\n",
      "yesterday. So far she had been only barely conscious of sore places\n",
      "and aching bones. These she would bear with. She loved the wild and the\n",
      "beautiful, both of which increased manifestly with every mile. The sun\n",
      "was warm, the air fragrant and cool, the sky blue as azure and so deep\n",
      "that she imagined that she could look far up into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look!” he called, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not thet way! Here! Aw, he's gone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! It was a bear! I saw it! Oh! not like circus bears at all!” cried\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had missed her opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon he was a grizzly, an' I'm jest as well pleased thet he loped\n",
      "off,” said Roy. Altering his course somewhat, he led to an old rotten\n",
      "log that the bear had been digging in. “After grubs. There, see his\n",
      "track. He was a whopper shore enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode on, out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range,\n",
      "gorge and ridge, green and black as far as Helen could see. The ranges\n",
      "were bold and long, climbing to the central uplift, where a number of\n",
      "fringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of Old Baldy.\n",
      "Far as vision could see, to the right lay one rolling forest of pine,\n",
      "beautiful and serene. Somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert,\n",
      "but it was not in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see turkeys 'way down there,” said Roy, backing away. “We'll go down\n",
      "and around an' mebbe I'll get a shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Descent beyond a rocky point was made through thick brush. This slope\n",
      "consisted of wide benches covered with copses and scattered pines and\n",
      "many oaks. Helen was delighted to see the familiar trees, although these\n",
      "were different from Missouri oaks. Rugged and gnarled, but not tall,\n",
      "these trees spread wide branches, the leaves of which were yellowing.\n",
      "Roy led into a grassy glade, and, leaping off his horse, rifle in hand,\n",
      "he prepared to shoot at something. Again Bo cried out, but this time it\n",
      "was in delight. Then Helen saw an immense flock of turkeys, apparently\n",
      "like the turkeys she knew at home, but these had bronze and checks\n",
      "of white, and they looked wild. There must have been a hundred in the\n",
      "flock, most of them hens. A few gobblers on the far side began the\n",
      "flight, running swiftly off. Helen plainly heard the thud of their\n",
      "feet. Roy shot once--twice--three times. Then rose a great commotion and\n",
      "thumping, and a loud roar of many wings. Dust and leaves whirling in the\n",
      "air were left where the turkeys had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I got two,” said Roy, and he strode forward to pick up his game.\n",
      "Returning, he tied two shiny, plump gobblers back of his saddle and\n",
      "remounted his horse. “We'll have turkey to-night, if Milt gets to camp\n",
      "in time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ride was resumed. Helen never would have tired riding through those\n",
      "oak groves, brown and sear and yellow, with leaves and acorns falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bears have been workin' in here already,” said Roy. “I see tracks all\n",
      "over. They eat acorns in the fall. An' mebbe we'll run into one yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees, so that\n",
      "dodging branches was no light task. Ranger did not seem to care how\n",
      "close he passed a tree or under a limb, so that he missed them himself;\n",
      "but Helen thereby got some additional bruises. Particularly hard was it,\n",
      "when passing a tree, to get her knee out of the way in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation\n",
      "and in places covered with a thick scum. But it had a current and an\n",
      "outlet, proving it to be a huge, spring. Roy pointed down at a muddy\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bear-wallow. He heard us comin'. Look at thet little track. Cub track.\n",
      "An' look at these scratches on this tree, higher 'n my head. An old\n",
      "she-bear stood up, an' scratched them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Woods's full of big bears,” he said, grinning. “An' I take it\n",
      "particular kind of this old she rustlin' off with her cub. She-bears\n",
      "with cubs are dangerous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next place to stir Helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom\n",
      "of this canuon. Beech-trees, maples, aspens, overtopped by lofty\n",
      "pines, made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown,\n",
      "swirling current, and leaves drifted down, and stray flecks of golden\n",
      "sunlight lightened the gloom. Here was hard riding to and fro across the\n",
      "brook, between huge mossy boulders, and between aspens so close together\n",
      "that Helen could scarce squeeze her knees through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more Roy climbed out of that canuon, over a ridge into another,\n",
      "down long wooded slopes and through scrub-oak thickets, on and on\n",
      "till the sun stood straight overhead. Then he halted for a short rest,\n",
      "unsaddled the horses to let them roll, and gave the girls some cold\n",
      "lunch that he had packed. He strolled off with his gun, and, upon\n",
      "returning, resaddled and gave the word to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the last of rest and easy traveling for the girls. The forest\n",
      "that he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines\n",
      "so steep of slope as to make precarious travel. Mostly he kept to the\n",
      "bottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail. But it was necessary\n",
      "to cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed, and this\n",
      "crossing was work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close\n",
      "knit. They tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders. Ranger\n",
      "appeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less.\n",
      "Bo's white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place. On\n",
      "the other hand, some of these steep slopes, were comparatively free of\n",
      "underbrush. Great firs and pines loomed up on all sides. The earth was\n",
      "soft and the hoofs sank deep. Toward the bottom of a descent Ranger\n",
      "would brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches. This\n",
      "mode facilitated travel, but it frightened Helen. The climb out then on\n",
      "the other side had to be done on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "After half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way Helen's strength was\n",
      "spent and her breath was gone. She felt light-headed. She could not get\n",
      "enough air. Her feet felt like lead, and her riding-coat was a burden.\n",
      "A hundred times, hot and wet and throbbing, she was compelled to stop.\n",
      "Always she had been a splendid walker and climber. And here, to break up\n",
      "the long ride, she was glad to be on her feet. But she could only drag\n",
      "one foot up after the other. Then, when her nose began to bleed, she\n",
      "realized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble.\n",
      "Her heart, however, did not hurt her, though she was conscious of an\n",
      "oppression on her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest\n",
      "verdure that it appeared impossible to cross. Nevertheless, he started\n",
      "down, dismounting after a little way. Helen found that leading Ranger\n",
      "down was worse than riding him. He came fast and he would step right\n",
      "in her tracks. She was not quick enough to get away from him. Twice\n",
      "he stepped on her foot, and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and\n",
      "threw her flat. When he began to slide, near the bottom, Helen had to\n",
      "run for her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell! Isn't--this--great?” panted Bo, from somewhere ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo--your--mind's--gone,” panted Helen, in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy tried several places to climb out, and failed in each. Leading down\n",
      "the ravine for a hundred yards or more, he essayed another attempt.\n",
      "Here there had been a slide, and in part the earth was bare. When he had\n",
      "worked up this, he halted above, and called:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad place! Keep on the up side of the hosses!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This appeared easier said than done. Helen could not watch Bo, because\n",
      "Ranger would not wait. He pulled at the bridle and snorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Faster you come the better,” called Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not see the sense of that, but she tried. Roy and Bo had dug\n",
      "a deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide. Helen made the mistake\n",
      "of starting to follow in their tracks, and when she realized this Ranger\n",
      "was climbing fast, almost dragging her, and it was too late to get\n",
      "above. Helen began to labor. She slid down right in front of Ranger. The\n",
      "intelligent animal, with a snort, plunged out of the trail to keep from\n",
      "stepping on her. Then he was above her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lookout down there,” yelled Roy, in warning. “Get on the up side!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But that did not appear possible. The earth began to slide under Ranger,\n",
      "and that impeded Helen's progress. He got in advance of her, straining\n",
      "on the bridle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let go!” yelled Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with\n",
      "Ranger. He snorted fiercely, and, rearing high, in a mighty plunge he\n",
      "gained solid ground. Helen was buried to her knees, but, extricating\n",
      "herself, she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad cave-in, thet,” was Roy's comment, when at last she joined him and\n",
      "Bo at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy appeared at a loss as to which way to go. He rode to high ground and\n",
      "looked in all directions. To Helen, one way appeared as wild and rough\n",
      "as another, and all was yellow, green, and black under the westering\n",
      "sun. Roy rode a short distance in one direction, then changed for\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'm shore turned round,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're not lost?” cried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I've been thet for a couple of hours,” he replied, cheerfully.\n",
      "“Never did ride across here I had the direction, but I'm blamed now if I\n",
      "can tell which way thet was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed at him in consternation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lost!” she echoed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence ensued, fraught with poignant fear for Helen, as she gazed\n",
      "into Bo's whitening face. She read her sister's mind. Bo was remembering\n",
      "tales of lost people who never were found.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me an' Milt get lost every day,” said Roy. “You don't suppose any man\n",
      "can know all this big country. It's nothin' for us to be lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!... I was lost when I was little,” said Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckon it'd been better not to tell you so offhand like,”\n",
      " replied Roy, contritely. “Don't feel bad, now. All I need is a peek at\n",
      "Old Baldy. Then I'll have my bearin'. Come on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's confidence returned as Roy led off at a fast trot. He rode\n",
      "toward the westering sun, keeping to the ridge they had ascended, until\n",
      "once more he came out upon a promontory. Old Baldy loomed there, blacker\n",
      "and higher and closer. The dark forest showed round, yellow, bare spots\n",
      "like parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so far off the track,” said Roy, as he wheeled his horse. “We'll\n",
      "make camp in Milt's senaca to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He led down off the ridge into a valley and then up to higher altitude,\n",
      "where the character of the forest changed. The trees were no longer\n",
      "pines, but firs and spruce, growing thin and exceedingly tall, with\n",
      "few branches below the topmost foliage. So dense was this forest that\n",
      "twilight seemed to have come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel was arduous. Everywhere were windfalls that had to be avoided,\n",
      "and not a rod was there without a fallen tree. The horses, laboring\n",
      "slowly, sometimes sank knee-deep into the brown duff. Gray moss\n",
      "festooned the tree-trunks and an amber-green moss grew thick on the\n",
      "rotting logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen loved this forest primeval. It was so still, so dark, so gloomy,\n",
      "so full of shadows and shade, and a dank smell of rotting wood, and\n",
      "sweet fragrance of spruce. The great windfalls, where trees were jammed\n",
      "together in dozens, showed the savagery of the storms. Wherever a single\n",
      "monarch lay uprooted there had sprung up a number of ambitious sons,\n",
      "jealous of one another, fighting for place. Even the trees fought one\n",
      "another! The forest was a place of mystery, but its strife could be read\n",
      "by any eye. The lightnings had split firs clear to the roots, and others\n",
      "it had circled with ripping tear from top to trunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time came, however, when the exceeding wildness of the forest, in\n",
      "density and fallen timber, made it imperative for Helen to put all her\n",
      "attention on the ground and trees in her immediate vicinity. So the\n",
      "pleasure of gazing ahead at the beautiful wilderness was denied her.\n",
      "Thereafter travel became toil and the hours endless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy led on, and Ranger followed, while the shadows darkened under the\n",
      "trees. She was reeling in her saddle, half blind and sick, when Roy\n",
      "called out cheerily that they were almost there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever his idea was, to Helen it seemed many miles that she followed\n",
      "him farther, out of the heavy-timbered forest down upon slopes of low\n",
      "spruce, like evergreen, which descended sharply to another level, where\n",
      "dark, shallow streams flowed gently and the solemn stillness held a low\n",
      "murmur of falling water, and at last the wood ended upon a wonderful\n",
      "park full of a thick, rich, golden light of fast-fading sunset.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Smell the smoke,” said Roy. “By Solomon! if Milt ain't here ahead of\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He rode on. Helen's weary gaze took in the round senaca, the circling\n",
      "black slopes, leading up to craggy rims all gold and red in the\n",
      "last flare of the sun; then all the spirit left in her flashed up in\n",
      "thrilling wonder at this exquisite, wild, and colorful spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horses were grazing out in the long grass and there were deer grazing\n",
      "with them. Roy led round a corner of the fringed, bordering woodland,\n",
      "and there, under lofty trees, shone a camp-fire. Huge gray rocks loomed\n",
      "beyond, and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain\n",
      "wall, over which poured a thin, lacy waterfall. As Helen gazed in\n",
      "rapture the sunset gold faded to white and all the western slope of the\n",
      "amphitheater darkened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's tall form appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you're late,” he said, as with a comprehensive flash of eye he\n",
      "took in the three.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I got lost,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feared as much.... You girls look like you'd done better to ride with\n",
      "me,” went on Dale, as he offered a hand to help Bo off. She took it,\n",
      "tried to get her foot out of the stirrups, and then she slid from the\n",
      "saddle into Dale's arms. He placed her on her feet and, supporting her,\n",
      "said, solicitously: “A hundred-mile ride in three days for a tenderfoot\n",
      "is somethin' your uncle Al won't believe.... Come, walk if it kills\n",
      "you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon he led Bo, very much as if he were teaching a child to walk.\n",
      "The fact that the voluble Bo had nothing to say was significant to\n",
      "Helen, who was following, with the assistance of Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the huge rocks resembled a sea-shell in that it contained a\n",
      "hollow over which the wide-spreading shelf flared out. It reached toward\n",
      "branches of great pines. A spring burst from a crack in the solid rock.\n",
      "The campfire blazed under a pine, and the blue column of smoke rose just\n",
      "in front of the shelving rock. Packs were lying on the grass and some\n",
      "of them were open. There were no signs here of a permanent habitation of\n",
      "the hunter. But farther on were other huge rocks, leaning, cracked, and\n",
      "forming caverns, some of which perhaps he utilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My camp is just back,” said Dale, as if he had read Helen's mind.\n",
      "“To-morrow we'll fix up comfortable-like round here for you girls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen and Bo were made as easy as blankets and saddles could make them,\n",
      "and the men went about their tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--isn't this--a dream?” murmured Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, child. It's real--terribly real,” replied Helen. “Now that we're\n",
      "here--with that awful ride over--we can think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's so pretty--here,” yawned Bo. “I'd just as lief Uncle Al didn't\n",
      "find us very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! He's a sick man. Think what the worry will be to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet if he knows Dale he won't be so worried.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale told us Uncle Al disliked him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pooh! What difference does that make?... Oh, I don't know which I\n",
      "am--hungrier or tireder!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn't eat to-night,” said Helen, wearily.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she stretched out she had a vague, delicious sensation that that\n",
      "was the end of Helen Rayner, and she was glad. Above her, through the\n",
      "lacy, fernlike pine-needles, she saw blue sky and a pale star just\n",
      "showing. Twilight was stealing down swiftly. The silence was beautiful,\n",
      "seemingly undisturbed by the soft, silky, dreamy fall of water. Helen\n",
      "closed her eyes, ready for sleep, with the physical commotion within her\n",
      "body gradually yielding. In some places her bones felt as if they had\n",
      "come out through her flesh; in others throbbed deep-seated aches; her\n",
      "muscles appeared slowly to subside, to relax, with the quivering twinges\n",
      "ceasing one by one; through muscle and bone, through all her body,\n",
      "pulsed a burning current.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's head dropped on Helen's shoulder. Sense became vague to Helen. She\n",
      "lost the low murmur of the waterfall, and then the sound or feeling of\n",
      "some one at the campfire. And her last conscious thought was that she\n",
      "tried to open her eyes and could not.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she awoke all was bright. The sun shone almost directly overhead.\n",
      "Helen was astounded. Bo lay wrapped in deep sleep, her face flushed,\n",
      "with beads of perspiration on her brow and the chestnut curls damp.\n",
      "Helen threw down the blankets, and then, gathering courage--for she felt\n",
      "as if her back was broken--she endeavored to sit up. In vain! Her spirit\n",
      "was willing, but her muscles refused to act. It must take a violent\n",
      "spasmodic effort. She tried it with shut eyes, and, succeeding, sat\n",
      "there trembling. The commotion she had made in the blankets awoke Bo,\n",
      "and she blinked her surprised blue eyes in the sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello--Nell! do I have to--get up?” she asked, sleepily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you?” queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can I what?” Bo was now thoroughly awake and lay there staring at her\n",
      "sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--get up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd like to know why not,” retorted Bo, as she made the effort. She got\n",
      "one arm and shoulder up, only to flop back like a crippled thing. And\n",
      "she uttered the most piteous little moan. “I'm dead! I know--I am!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if you're going to be a Western girl you'd better have spunk\n",
      "enough to move.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” ejaculated Bo. Then she rolled over, not without groans, and,\n",
      "once upon her face, she raised herself on her hands and turned to a\n",
      "sitting posture. “Where's everybody?... Oh, Nell, it's perfectly lovely\n",
      "here. Paradise!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen looked around. A fire was smoldering. No one was in sight.\n",
      "Wonderful distant colors seemed to strike her glance as she tried to fix\n",
      "it upon near-by objects. A beautiful little green tent or shack had been\n",
      "erected out of spruce boughs. It had a slanting roof that sloped all the\n",
      "way from a ridge-pole to the ground; half of the opening in front was\n",
      "closed, as were the sides. The spruce boughs appeared all to be laid in\n",
      "the same direction, giving it a smooth, compact appearance, actually as\n",
      "if it had grown there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That lean-to wasn't there last night?” inquired Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn't see it. Lean-to? Where'd you get that name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's Western, my dear. I'll bet they put it up for us.... Sure, I see\n",
      "our bags inside. Let's get up. It must be late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls had considerable fun as well as pain in getting up and keeping\n",
      "each other erect until their limbs would hold them firmly. They were\n",
      "delighted with the spruce lean-to. It faced the open and stood just\n",
      "under the wide-spreading shelf of rock. The tiny outlet from the spring\n",
      "flowed beside it and spilled its clear water over a stone, to fall into\n",
      "a little pool. The floor of this woodland habitation consisted of tips\n",
      "of spruce boughs to about a foot in depth, all laid one way, smooth and\n",
      "springy, and so sweetly odorous that the air seemed intoxicating. Helen\n",
      "and Bo opened their baggage, and what with use of the cold water, brush\n",
      "and comb, and clean blouses, they made themselves feel as comfortable as\n",
      "possible, considering the excruciating aches. Then they went out to the\n",
      "campfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's eye was attracted by moving objects near at hand. Then\n",
      "simultaneously with Bo's cry of delight Helen saw a beautiful doe\n",
      "approaching under the trees. Dale walked beside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You sure had a long sleep,” was the hunter's greeting. “I reckon you\n",
      "both look better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good morning. Or is it afternoon? We're just able to move about,” said\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could ride,” declared Bo, stoutly. “Oh, Nell, look at the deer! It's\n",
      "coming to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doe had hung back a little as Dale reached the camp-fire. It was a\n",
      "gray, slender creature, smooth as silk, with great dark eyes. It stood a\n",
      "moment, long ears erect, and then with a graceful little trot came up\n",
      "to Bo and reached a slim nose for her outstretched hand. All about it,\n",
      "except the beautiful soft eyes, seemed wild, and yet it was as tame as\n",
      "a kitten. Then, suddenly, as Bo fondled the long ears, it gave a start\n",
      "and, breaking away, ran back out of sight under the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What frightened it?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale pointed up at the wall under the shelving roof of rock. There,\n",
      "twenty feet from the ground, curled up on a ledge, lay a huge tawny\n",
      "animal with a face like that of a cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's afraid of Tom,” replied Dale. “Recognizes him as a hereditary\n",
      "foe, I guess. I can't make friends of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So that's Tom--the pet lion!” exclaimed Bo. “Ugh! No wonder that\n",
      "deer ran off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long has he been up there?” queried Helen, gazing fascinated at\n",
      "Dale's famous pet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn't say. Tom comes an' goes,” replied Dale. “But I sent him up\n",
      "there last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he was there--perfectly free--right over us--while we slept!” burst\n",
      "out Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. An' I reckon you slept the safer for that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of all things! Nell, isn't he a monster? But he doesn't look like a\n",
      "lion--an African lion. He's a panther. I saw his like at the circus\n",
      "once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's a cougar,” said Dale. “The panther is long and slim. Tom is not\n",
      "only long, but thick an' round. I've had him four years. An' he was a\n",
      "kitten no bigger 'n my fist when I got him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he perfectly tame--safe?” asked Helen, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've never told anybody that Tom was safe, but he is,” replied Dale.\n",
      "“You can absolutely believe it. A wild cougar wouldn't attack a man\n",
      "unless cornered or starved. An' Tom is like a big kitten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The beast raised his great catlike face, with its sleepy, half-shut\n",
      "eyes, and looked down upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall I call him down?” inquired Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "For once Bo did not find her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us--get a little more used to him--at a distance,” replied Helen,\n",
      "with a little laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he comes to you, just rub his head an' you'll see how tame he is,”\n",
      " said Dale. “Reckon you're both hungry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so very,” returned Helen, aware of his penetrating gray gaze upon\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I am,” vouchsafed Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soon as the turkey's done we'll eat. My camp is round between the\n",
      "rocks. I'll call you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not until his broad back was turned did Helen notice that the hunter\n",
      "looked different. Then she saw he wore a lighter, cleaner suit of\n",
      "buckskin, with no coat, and instead of the high-heeled horseman's boots\n",
      "he wore moccasins and leggings. The change made him appear more lithe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I don't know what you think, but _I_ call him handsome,” declared\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had no idea what she thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's try to walk some,” she suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they essayed that painful task and got as far as a pine log some few\n",
      "rods from their camp. This point was close to the edge of the park, from\n",
      "which there was an unobstructed view.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My! What a place!” exclaimed Bo, with eyes wide and round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, beautiful!” breathed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unexpected blaze of color drew her gaze first. Out of the black\n",
      "spruce slopes shone patches of aspens, gloriously red and gold, and low\n",
      "down along the edge of timber troops of aspens ran out into the park,\n",
      "not yet so blazing as those above, but purple and yellow and white in\n",
      "the sunshine. Masses of silver spruce, like trees in moonlight, bordered\n",
      "the park, sending out here and there an isolated tree, sharp as a\n",
      "spear, with under-branches close to the ground. Long golden-green grass,\n",
      "resembling half-ripe wheat, covered the entire floor of the park, gently\n",
      "waving to the wind. Above sheered the black, gold-patched slopes, steep\n",
      "and unscalable, rising to buttresses of dark, iron-hued rock. And to\n",
      "the east circled the rows of cliff-bench, gray and old and fringed,\n",
      "splitting at the top in the notch where the lacy, slumberous waterfall,\n",
      "like white smoke, fell and vanished, to reappear in wider sheet of lace,\n",
      "only to fall and vanish again in the green depths.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a verdant valley, deep-set in the mountain walls, wild and sad\n",
      "and lonesome. The waterfall dominated the spirit of the place, dreamy\n",
      "and sleepy and tranquil; it murmured sweetly on one breath of wind, and\n",
      "lulled with another, and sometimes died out altogether, only to come\n",
      "again in soft, strange roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Paradise Park!” whispered Bo to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A call from Dale disturbed their raptures. Turning, they hobbled with\n",
      "eager but painful steps in the direction of a larger camp-fire, situated\n",
      "to the right of the great rock that sheltered their lean-to. No hut or\n",
      "house showed there and none was needed. Hiding-places and homes for a\n",
      "hundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs, split off\n",
      "in bygone ages from the mountain wall above. A few stately pines stood\n",
      "out from the rocks, and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown\n",
      "brook. This camp was only a step from the lean-to, round the corner of\n",
      "a huge rock, yet it had been out of sight. Here indeed was evidence of\n",
      "a hunter's home--pelts and skins and antlers, a neat pile of split\n",
      "fire-wood, a long ledge of rock, well sheltered, and loaded with\n",
      "bags like a huge pantry-shelf, packs and ropes and saddles, tools and\n",
      "weapons, and a platform of dry brush as shelter for a fire around which\n",
      "hung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hyar--you git!” shouted Dale, and he threw a stick at something. A bear\n",
      "cub scampered away in haste. He was small and woolly and brown, and he\n",
      "grunted as he ran. Soon he halted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's Bud,” said Dale, as the girls came up. “Guess he near starved in\n",
      "my absence. An' now he wants everythin', especially the sugar. We don't\n",
      "have sugar often up here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn't he dear? Oh, I love him!” cried Bo. “Come back, Bud. Come,\n",
      "Buddie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cub, however, kept his distance, watching Dale with bright little\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Mr. Roy?” asked Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy's gone. He was sorry not to say good-by. But it's important he gets\n",
      "down in the pines on Anson's trail. He'll hang to Anson, an' in case\n",
      "they get near Pine he'll ride in to see where your uncle is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you expect?” questioned Helen, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Most anythin',” he replied. “Al, I reckon, knows now. Maybe he's\n",
      "rustlin' into the mountains by this time. If he meets up with Anson,\n",
      "well an' good, for Roy won't be far off. An' sure if he runs across Roy,\n",
      "why they'll soon be here. But if I were you I wouldn't count on seein'\n",
      "your uncle very soon. I'm sorry. I've done my best. It sure is a bad\n",
      "deal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't think me ungracious,” replied Helen, hastily. How plainly he\n",
      "had intimated that it must be privation and annoyance for her to be\n",
      "compelled to accept his hospitality! “You are good--kind. I owe you\n",
      "much. I'll be eternally grateful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale straightened as he looked at her. His glance was intent, piercing.\n",
      "He seemed to be receiving a strange or unusual portent. No need for him\n",
      "to say he had never before been spoken to like that!\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may have to stay here with me--for weeks--maybe months--if we've\n",
      "the bad luck to get snowed in,” he said, slowly, as if startled at this\n",
      "deduction. “You're safe here. No sheep-thief could ever find this camp.\n",
      "I'll take risks to get you safe into Al's hands. But I'm goin' to be\n",
      "pretty sure about what I'm doin'.... So--there's plenty to eat an' it's\n",
      "a pretty place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty! Why, it's grand!” exclaimed Bo. “I've called it Paradise Park.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Paradise Park,” he repeated, weighing the words. “You've named it an'\n",
      "also the creek. Paradise Creek! I've been here twelve years with no fit\n",
      "name for my home till you said that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, that pleases me!” returned Bo, with shining eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eat now,” said Dale. “An' I reckon you'll like that turkey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a clean tarpaulin upon which were spread steaming, fragrant\n",
      "pans--roast turkey, hot biscuits and gravy, mashed potatoes as white as\n",
      "if prepared at home, stewed dried apples, and butter and coffee. This\n",
      "bounteous repast surprised and delighted the girls; when they had once\n",
      "tasted the roast wild turkey, then Milt Dale had occasion to blush at\n",
      "their encomiums.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope--Uncle Al--doesn't come for a month,” declared Bo, as she tried\n",
      "to get her breath. There was a brown spot on her nose and one on each\n",
      "cheek, suspiciously close to her mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale laughed. It was pleasant to hear him, for his laugh seemed unused\n",
      "and deep, as if it came from tranquil depths.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Won't you eat with us?” asked Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I will,” he said, “it'll save time, an' hot grub tastes better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite an interval of silence ensued, which presently was broken by Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here comes Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen observed with a thrill that the cougar was magnificent, seen erect\n",
      "on all-fours, approaching with slow, sinuous grace. His color was tawny,\n",
      "with spots of whitish gray. He had bow-legs, big and round and furry,\n",
      "and a huge head with great tawny eyes. No matter how tame he was said\n",
      "to be, he looked wild. Like a dog he walked right up, and it so happened\n",
      "that he was directly behind Bo, within reach of her when she turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Lord!” cried Bo, and up went both of her hands, in one of which\n",
      "was a huge piece of turkey. Tom took it, not viciously, but nevertheless\n",
      "with a snap that made Helen jump. As if by magic the turkey vanished.\n",
      "And Tom took a closer step toward Bo. Her expression of fright changed\n",
      "to consternation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He stole my turkey!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, come here,” ordered Dale, sharply. The cougar glided round rather\n",
      "sheepishly. “Now lie down an' behave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom crouched on all-fours, his head resting on his paws, with his\n",
      "beautiful tawny eyes, light and piercing, fixed upon the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't grab,” said Dale, holding out a piece of turkey. Whereupon Tom\n",
      "took it less voraciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happened, the little bear cub saw this transaction, and he plainly\n",
      "indicated his opinion of the preference shown to Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, the dear!” exclaimed Bo. “He means it's not fair.... Come,\n",
      "Bud--come on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bud would not approach the group until called by Dale. Then he\n",
      "scrambled to them with every manifestation of delight. Bo almost forgot\n",
      "her own needs in feeding him and getting acquainted with him. Tom\n",
      "plainly showed his jealousy of Bud, and Bud likewise showed his fear of\n",
      "the great cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not believe the evidence of her eyes--that she was in the\n",
      "woods calmly and hungrily partaking of sweet, wild-flavored meat--that\n",
      "a full-grown mountain lion lay on one side of her and a baby brown bear\n",
      "sat on the other--that a strange hunter, a man of the forest, there in\n",
      "his lonely and isolated fastness, appealed to the romance in her and\n",
      "interested her as no one else she had ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the wonderful meal was at last finished Bo enticed the bear cub\n",
      "around to the camp of the girls, and there soon became great comrades\n",
      "with him. Helen, watching Bo play, was inclined to envy her. No matter\n",
      "where Bo was placed, she always got something out of it. She adapted\n",
      "herself. She, who could have a good time with almost any one or\n",
      "anything, would find the hours sweet and fleeting in this beautiful park\n",
      "of wild wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "But merely objective actions--merely physical movements, had never yet\n",
      "contented Helen. She could run and climb and ride and play with hearty\n",
      "and healthy abandon, but those things would not suffice long for her,\n",
      "and her mind needed food. Helen was a thinker. One reason she had\n",
      "desired to make her home in the West was that by taking up a life of the\n",
      "open, of action, she might think and dream and brood less. And here she\n",
      "was in the wild West, after the three most strenuously active days of\n",
      "her career, and still the same old giant revolved her mind and turned it\n",
      "upon herself and upon all she saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can I do?” she asked Bo, almost helplessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, rest, you silly!” retorted Bo. “You walk like an old, crippled\n",
      "woman with only one leg.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen hoped the comparison was undeserved, but the advice was sound.\n",
      "The blankets spread out on the grass looked inviting and they felt\n",
      "comfortably warm in the sunshine. The breeze was slow, languorous,\n",
      "fragrant, and it brought the low hum of the murmuring waterfall, like\n",
      "a melody of bees. Helen made a pillow and lay down to rest. The green\n",
      "pine-needles, so thin and fine in their crisscross network, showed\n",
      "clearly against the blue sky. She looked in vain for birds. Then\n",
      "her gaze went wonderingly to the lofty fringed rim of the great\n",
      "amphitheater, and as she studied it she began to grasp its remoteness,\n",
      "how far away it was in the rarefied atmosphere. A black eagle, sweeping\n",
      "along, looked of tiny size, and yet he was far under the heights above.\n",
      "How pleasant she fancied it to be up there! And drowsy fancy lulled her\n",
      "to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen slept all afternoon, and upon awakening, toward sunset, found Bo\n",
      "curled beside her. Dale had thoughtfully covered them with a blanket;\n",
      "also he had built a camp-fire. The air was growing keen and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, when they had put their coats on and made comfortable seats\n",
      "beside the fire, Dale came over, apparently to visit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you can't sleep all the time,” he said. “An' bein' city girls,\n",
      "you'll get lonesome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lonesome!” echoed Helen. The idea of her being lonesome here had not\n",
      "occurred to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've thought that all out,” went on Dale, as he sat down, Indian\n",
      "fashion, before the blaze. “It's natural you'd find time drag up here,\n",
      "bein' used to lots of people an' goin's-on, an' work, an' all girls\n",
      "like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd never be lonesome here,” replied Helen, with her direct force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale did not betray surprise, but he showed that his mistake was\n",
      "something to ponder over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me,” he said, presently, as his gray eyes held hers. “That's\n",
      "how I had it. As I remember girls--an' it doesn't seem long since I left\n",
      "home--most of them would die of lonesomeness up here.” Then he addressed\n",
      "himself to Bo. “How about you? You see, I figured you'd be the one that\n",
      "liked it, an' your sister the one who wouldn't.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't get lonesome very soon,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm glad. It worried me some--not ever havin' girls as company before.\n",
      "An' in a day or so, when you're rested, I'll help you pass the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's eyes were full of flashing interest, and Helen asked him, “How?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sincere expression of her curiosity and not doubtful or\n",
      "ironic challenge of an educated woman to a man of the forest. But as a\n",
      "challenge he took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How!” he repeated, and a strange smile flitted across his face. “Why,\n",
      "by givin' you rides an' climbs to beautiful places. An' then, if you're\n",
      "interested,' to show you how little so-called civilized people know of\n",
      "nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen realized then that whatever his calling, hunter or wanderer or\n",
      "hermit, he was not uneducated, even if he appeared illiterate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be happy to learn from you,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me, too!” chimed in Bo. “You can't tell too much to any one from\n",
      "Missouri.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled, and that warmed Helen to him, for then he seemed less removed\n",
      "from other people. About this hunter there began to be something of the\n",
      "very nature of which he spoke--a stillness, aloofness, an unbreakable\n",
      "tranquillity, a cold, clear spirit like that in the mountain air, a\n",
      "physical something not unlike the tamed wildness of his pets or the\n",
      "strength of the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet I can tell you more 'n you'll ever remember,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What 'll you bet?” retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, more roast turkey against--say somethin' nice when you're safe\n",
      "an' home to your uncle Al's, runnin' his ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Agreed. Nell, you hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen nodded her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right. We'll leave it to Nell,” began Dale, half seriously. “Now\n",
      "I'll tell you, first, for the fun of passin' time we'll ride an' race\n",
      "my horses out in the park. An' we'll fish in the brooks an' hunt in the\n",
      "woods. There's an old silvertip around that you can see me kill. An'\n",
      "we'll climb to the peaks an' see wonderful sights.... So much for\n",
      "that. Now, if you really want to learn--or if you only want me to tell\n",
      "you--well, that's no matter. Only I'll win the bet!... You'll see\n",
      "how this park lies in the crater of a volcano an' was once full of\n",
      "water--an' how the snow blows in on one side in winter, a hundred feet\n",
      "deep, when there's none on the other. An' the trees--how they grow an'\n",
      "live an' fight one another an' depend on one another, an' protect\n",
      "the forest from storm-winds. An' how they hold the water that is the\n",
      "fountains of the great rivers. An' how the creatures an' things that\n",
      "live in them or on them are good for them, an' neither could live\n",
      "without the other. An' then I'll show you my pets tame an' untamed, an'\n",
      "tell you how it's man that makes any creature wild--how easy they are\n",
      "to tame--an' how they learn to love you. An' there's the life of the\n",
      "forest, the strife of it--how the bear lives, an' the cats, an' the\n",
      "wolves, an' the deer. You'll see how cruel nature is how savage an'\n",
      "wild the wolf or cougar tears down the deer--how a wolf loves fresh, hot\n",
      "blood, an' how a cougar unrolls the skin of a deer back from his neck.\n",
      "An' you'll see that this cruelty of nature--this work of the wolf an'\n",
      "cougar--is what makes the deer so beautiful an' healthy an' swift an'\n",
      "sensitive. Without his deadly foes the deer would deteriorate an' die\n",
      "out. An' you'll see how this principle works out among all creatures of\n",
      "the forest. Strife! It's the meanin' of all creation, an' the salvation.\n",
      "If you're quick to see, you'll learn that the nature here in the wilds\n",
      "is the same as that of men--only men are no longer cannibals. Trees\n",
      "fight to live--birds fight--animals fight--men fight. They all live\n",
      "off one another. An' it's this fightin' that brings them all closer an'\n",
      "closer to bein' perfect. But nothin' will ever be perfect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how about religion?” interrupted Helen, earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nature has a religion, an' it's to live--to grow--to reproduce, each of\n",
      "its kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that is not God or the immortality of the soul,” declared Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it's as close to God an' immortality as nature ever gets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you would rob me of my religion!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I just talk as I see life,” replied Dale, reflectively, as he poked\n",
      "a stick into the red embers of the fire. “Maybe I have a religion. I\n",
      "don't know. But it's not the kind you have--not the Bible kind. That\n",
      "kind doesn't keep the men in Pine an' Snowdrop an' all over--sheepmen\n",
      "an' ranchers an' farmers an' travelers, such as I've known--the religion\n",
      "they profess doesn't keep them from lyin', cheatin', stealin', an'\n",
      "killin'. I reckon no man who lives as I do--which perhaps is my\n",
      "religion--will lie or cheat or steal or kill, unless it's to kill in\n",
      "self-defense or like I'd do if Snake Anson would ride up here now.\n",
      "My religion, maybe, is love of life--wild life as it was in the\n",
      "beginnin'--an' the wind that blows secrets from everywhere, an' the\n",
      "water that sings all day an' night, an' the stars that shine constant,\n",
      "an' the trees that speak somehow, an' the rocks that aren't dead. I'm\n",
      "never alone here or on the trails. There's somethin' unseen, but always\n",
      "with me. An' that's It! Call it God if you like. But what stalls me\n",
      "is--where was that Spirit when this earth was a ball of fiery gas? Where\n",
      "will that Spirit be when all life is frozen out or burned out on this\n",
      "globe an' it hangs dead in space like the moon? That time will come.\n",
      "There's no waste in nature. Not the littlest atom is destroyed. It\n",
      "changes, that's all, as you see this pine wood go up in smoke an' feel\n",
      "somethin' that's heat come out of it. Where does that go? It's not lost.\n",
      "Nothin' is lost. So, the beautiful an' savin' thought is, maybe all\n",
      "rock an' wood, water an' blood an' flesh, are resolved back into the\n",
      "elements, to come to life somewhere again sometime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, what you say is wonderful, but it's terrible!” exclaimed Helen. He\n",
      "had struck deep into her soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Terrible? I reckon,” he replied, sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then ensued a little interval of silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt Dale, I lose the bet,” declared Bo, with earnestness behind her\n",
      "frivolity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd forgotten that. Reckon I talked a lot,” he said, apologetically.\n",
      "“You see, I don't get much chance to talk, except to myself or Tom.\n",
      "Years ago, when I found the habit of silence settlin' down on me, I took\n",
      "to thinkin' out loud an' talkin' to anythin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could listen to you all night,” returned Bo, dreamily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you read--do you have books?” inquired Helen, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I read tolerable well; a good deal better than I talk or write,”\n",
      " he replied. “I went to school till I was fifteen. Always hated study,\n",
      "but liked to read. Years ago an old friend of mine down here at\n",
      "Pine--Widow Cass--she gave me a lot of old books. An' I packed them up\n",
      "here. Winter's the time I read.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversation lagged after that, except for desultory remarks, and\n",
      "presently Dale bade the girls good night and left them. Helen watched\n",
      "his tall form vanish in the gloom under the pines, and after he had\n",
      "disappeared she still stared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!” called Bo, shrilly. “I've called you three times. I want to go\n",
      "to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I--I was thinking,” rejoined Helen, half embarrassed, half\n",
      "wondering at herself. “I didn't hear you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should smile you didn't,” retorted Bo. “Wish you could just have seen\n",
      "your eyes. Nell, do you want me to tell you something?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--yes,” said Helen, rather feebly. She did not at all, when Bo\n",
      "talked like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're going to fall in love with that wild hunter,” declared Bo in a\n",
      "voice that rang like a bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was not only amazed, but enraged. She caught her breath\n",
      "preparatory to giving this incorrigible sister a piece of her mind. Bo\n",
      "went calmly on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can feel it in my bones.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you're a little fool--a sentimental, romancing, gushy little fool!”\n",
      " retorted Helen. “All you seem to hold in your head is some rot about\n",
      "love. To hear you talk one would think there's nothing else in the world\n",
      "but love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's eyes were bright, shrewd, affectionate, and laughing as she bent\n",
      "their steady gaze upon Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, that's just it. There IS nothing else!”\n",

      "CHAPTER X\n",
      "\n",
      "The night of sleep was so short that it was difficult for Helen to\n",
      "believe that hours had passed. Bo appeared livelier this morning, with\n",
      "less complaint of aches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, you've got color!” exclaimed Bo. “And your eyes are bright. Isn't\n",
      "the morning perfectly lovely?... Couldn't you get drunk on that air? I\n",
      "smell flowers. And oh! I'm hungry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, our host will soon have need of his hunting abilities if your\n",
      "appetite holds,” said Helen, as she tried to keep her hair out of her\n",
      "eyes while she laced her boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! there's a big dog--a hound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen looked as Bo directed, and saw a hound of unusually large\n",
      "proportions, black and tan in color, with long, drooping ears. Curiously\n",
      "he trotted nearer to the door of their hut and then stopped to gaze at\n",
      "them. His head was noble, his eyes shone dark and sad. He seemed neither\n",
      "friendly nor unfriendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, doggie! Come right in--we won't hurt you,” called Bo, but\n",
      "without enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "This made Helen laugh. “Bo, you're simply delicious,” she said. “You're\n",
      "afraid of that dog.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. Wonder if he's Dale's. Of course he must be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the hound trotted away out of sight. When the girls presented\n",
      "themselves at the camp-fire they espied their curious canine visitor\n",
      "lying down. His ears were so long that half of them lay on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sent Pedro over to wake you girls up,” said Dale, after greeting\n",
      "them. “Did he scare you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pedro. So that's his name. No, he didn't exactly scare me. He did Nell,\n",
      "though. She's an awful tenderfoot,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's a splendid-looking dog,” said Helen, ignoring her sister's sally.\n",
      "“I love dogs. Will he make friends?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's shy an' wild. You see, when I leave camp he won't hang around. He\n",
      "an' Tom are jealous of each other. I had a pack of hounds an' lost all\n",
      "but Pedro on account of Tom. I think you can make friends with Pedro.\n",
      "Try it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Helen made overtures to Pedro, and not wholly in vain. The\n",
      "dog was matured, of almost stern aloofness, and manifestly not used to\n",
      "people. His deep, wine-dark eyes seemed to search Helen's soul. They\n",
      "were honest and wise, with a strange sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He looks intelligent,” observed Helen, as she smoothed the long, dark\n",
      "ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That hound is nigh human,” responded Dale. “Come, an' while you eat\n",
      "I'll tell you about Pedro.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had gotten the hound as a pup from a Mexican sheep-herder who\n",
      "claimed he was part California bloodhound. He grew up, becoming attached\n",
      "to Dale. In his younger days he did not get along well with Dale's other\n",
      "pets and Dale gave him to a rancher down in the valley. Pedro was back\n",
      "in Dale's camp next day. From that day Dale began to care more for the\n",
      "hound, but he did not want to keep him, for various reasons, chief of\n",
      "which was the fact that Pedro was too fine a dog to be left alone half\n",
      "the time to shift for himself. That fall Dale had need to go to the\n",
      "farthest village, Snowdrop, where he left Pedro with a friend. Then Dale\n",
      "rode to Show Down and Pine, and the camp of the Beemans' and with them\n",
      "he trailed some wild horses for a hundred miles, over into New Mexico.\n",
      "The snow was flying when Dale got back to his camp in the mountains.\n",
      "And there was Pedro, gaunt and worn, overjoyed to welcome him home. Roy\n",
      "Beeman visited Dale that October and told that Dale's friend in Snowdrop\n",
      "had not been able to keep Pedro. He broke a chain and scaled a ten-foot\n",
      "fence to escape. He trailed Dale to Show Down, where one of Dale's\n",
      "friends, recognizing the hound, caught him, and meant to keep him until\n",
      "Dale's return. But Pedro refused to eat. It happened that a freighter\n",
      "was going out to the Beeman camp, and Dale's friend boxed Pedro up and\n",
      "put him on the wagon. Pedro broke out of the box, returned to Show Down,\n",
      "took up Dale's trail to Pine, and then on to the Beeman camp. That was\n",
      "as far as Roy could trace the movements of the hound. But he believed,\n",
      "and so did Dale, that Pedro had trailed them out on the wild-horse hunt.\n",
      "The following spring Dale learned more from the herder of a sheepman at\n",
      "whose camp he and the Beemans; had rested on the way into New Mexico.\n",
      "It appeared that after Dale had left this camp Pedro had arrived, and\n",
      "another Mexican herder had stolen the hound. But Pedro got away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' he was here when I arrived,” concluded Dale, smiling. “I never\n",
      "wanted to get rid of him after that. He's turned out to be the finest\n",
      "dog I ever knew. He knows what I say. He can almost talk. An' I swear he\n",
      "can cry. He does whenever I start off without him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How perfectly wonderful!” exclaimed Bo. “Aren't animals great?... But I\n",
      "love horses best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Helen that Pedro understood they were talking about him,\n",
      "for he looked ashamed, and swallowed hard, and dropped his gaze. She\n",
      "knew something of the truth about the love of dogs for their owners.\n",
      "This story of Dale's, however, was stranger than any she had ever heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom, the cougar, put in an appearance then, and there was scarcely love\n",
      "in the tawny eyes he bent upon Pedro. But the hound did not deign to\n",
      "notice him. Tom sidled up to Bo, who sat on the farther side of the\n",
      "tarpaulin table-cloth, and manifestly wanted part of her breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee! I love the look of him,” she said. “But when he's close he makes\n",
      "my flesh creep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasts are as queer as people,” observed Dale. “They take likes an'\n",
      "dislikes. I believe Tom has taken a shine to you an' Pedro begins to be\n",
      "interested in your sister. I can tell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Bud?” inquired Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's asleep or around somewhere. Now, soon as I get the work done, what\n",
      "would you girls like to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride!” declared Bo, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aren't you sore an' stiff?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am that. But I don't care. Besides, when I used to go out to my\n",
      "uncle's farm near Saint Joe I always found riding to be a cure for\n",
      "aches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure is, if you can stand it. An' what will your sister like to do?”\n",
      " returned Dale, turning to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I'll rest, and watch you folks--and dream,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But after you've rested you must be active,” said Dale, seriously. “You\n",
      "must do things. It doesn't matter what, just as long as you don't sit\n",
      "idle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” queried Helen, in surprise. “Why not be idle here in this\n",
      "beautiful, wild place? just to dream away the hours--the days! I could\n",
      "do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you mustn't. It took me years to learn how bad that was for me. An'\n",
      "right now I would love nothin' more than to forget my work, my horses\n",
      "an' pets--everythin', an' just lay around, seein' an' feelin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seeing and feeling? Yes, that must be what I mean. But why--what is\n",
      "it? There are the beauty and color--the wild, shaggy slopes--the gray\n",
      "cliffs--the singing wind--the lulling water--the clouds--the sky. And\n",
      "the silence, loneliness, sweetness of it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a driftin' back. What I love to do an' yet fear most. It's what\n",
      "makes a lone hunter of a man. An' it can grow so strong that it binds a\n",
      "man to the wilds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How strange!” murmured Helen. “But that could never bind ME. Why, I\n",
      "must live and fulfil my mission, my work in the civilized world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Helen that Dale almost imperceptibly shrank at her earnest\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ways of Nature are strange,” he said. “I look at it different.\n",
      "Nature's just as keen to wean you back to a savage state as you are to\n",
      "be civilized. An' if Nature won, you would carry out her design all the\n",
      "better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This hunter's talk shocked Helen and yet stimulated her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me--a savage? Oh no!” she exclaimed. “But, if that were possible, what\n",
      "would Nature's design be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You spoke of your mission in life,” he replied. “A woman's mission is\n",
      "to have children. The female of any species has only one mission--to\n",
      "reproduce its kind. An' Nature has only one mission--toward greater\n",
      "strength, virility, efficiency--absolute perfection, which is\n",
      "unattainable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What of mental and spiritual development of man and woman?” asked\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both are direct obstacles to the design of Nature. Nature is physical.\n",
      "To create for limitless endurance for eternal life. That must be\n",
      "Nature's inscrutable design. An' why she must fail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the soul!” whispered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! When you speak of the soul an' I speak of life we mean the same.\n",
      "You an' I will have some talks while you're here. I must brush up my\n",
      "thoughts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So must I, it seems,” said Helen, with a slow smile. She had been\n",
      "rendered grave and thoughtful. “But I guess I'll risk dreaming under the\n",
      "pines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had been watching them with her keen blue eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, it'd take a thousand years to make a savage of you,” she said.\n",
      "“But a week will do for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you were one before you left Saint Joe,” replied Helen. “Don't you\n",
      "remember that school-teacher Barnes who said you were a wildcat and an\n",
      "Indian mixed? He spanked you with a ruler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never! He missed me,” retorted Bo, with red in her cheeks. “Nell, I\n",
      "wish you'd not tell things about me when I was a kid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was only two years ago,” expostulated Helen, in mild surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose it was. I was a kid all right. I'll bet you--” Bo broke up\n",
      "abruptly, and, tossing her head, she gave Tom a pat and then ran away\n",
      "around the corner of cliff wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen followed leisurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Nell,” said Bo, when Helen arrived at their little green\n",
      "ledge-pole hut, “do you know that hunter fellow will upset some of your\n",
      "theories?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe. I'll admit he amazes me--and affronts me, too, I'm afraid,”\n",
      " replied Helen. “What surprises me is that in spite of his evident lack\n",
      "of schooling he's not raw or crude. He's elemental.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sister dear, wake up. The man's wonderful. You can learn more from\n",
      "him than you ever learned in your life. So can I. I always hated books,\n",
      "anyway.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When, a little later, Dale approached carrying some bridles, the hound\n",
      "Pedro trotted at his heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you'd better ride the horse you had,” he said to Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever you say. But I hope you let me ride them all, by and by.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. I've a mustang out there you'll like. But he pitches a little,”\n",
      " he rejoined, and turned away toward the park. The hound looked after him\n",
      "and then at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Pedro. Stay with me,” called Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, hearing her, motioned the hound back. Obediently Pedro trotted to\n",
      "her, still shy and soberly watchful, as if not sure of her intentions,\n",
      "but with something of friendliness about him now. Helen found a soft,\n",
      "restful seat in the sun facing the park, and there composed herself for\n",
      "what she felt would be slow, sweet, idle hours. Pedro curled down beside\n",
      "her. The tall form of Dale stalked across the park, out toward the\n",
      "straggling horses. Again she saw a deer grazing among them. How erect\n",
      "and motionless it stood watching Dale! Presently it bounded away toward\n",
      "the edge of the forest. Some of the horses whistled and ran, kicking\n",
      "heels high in the air. The shrill whistles rang clear in the stillness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee! Look at them go!” exclaimed Bo, gleefully, coming up to where\n",
      "Helen sat. Bo threw herself down upon the fragrant pine-needles and\n",
      "stretched herself languorously, like a lazy kitten. There was something\n",
      "feline in her lithe, graceful outline. She lay flat and looked up\n",
      "through the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn't it be great, now,” she murmured, dreamily, half to herself,\n",
      "“if that Las Vegas cowboy would happen somehow to come, and then an\n",
      "earthquake would shut us up here in this Paradise valley so we'd never\n",
      "get out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! What would mother say to such talk as that?” gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Nell, wouldn't it be great?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be terrible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, there never was any romance in you, Nell Rayner,” replied Bo. “That\n",
      "very thing has actually happened out here in this wonderful country\n",
      "of wild places. You need not tell me! Sure it's happened. With the\n",
      "cliff-dwellers and the Indians and then white people. Every place I look\n",
      "makes me feel that. Nell, you'd have to see people in the moon through a\n",
      "telescope before you'd believe that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm practical and sensible, thank goodness!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, for the sake of argument,” protested Bo, with flashing eyes,\n",
      "“suppose it MIGHT happen. Just to please me, suppose we DID get shut up\n",
      "here with Dale and that cowboy we saw from the train. Shut in without\n",
      "any hope of ever climbing out.... What would you do? Would you give up\n",
      "and pine away and die? Or would you fight for life and whatever joy it\n",
      "might mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Self-preservation is the first instinct,” replied Helen, surprised at\n",
      "a strange, deep thrill in the depths of her. “I'd fight for life, of\n",
      "course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Well, really, when I think seriously I don't want anything like\n",
      "that to happen. But, just the same, if it DID happen I would glory in\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were talking Dale returned with the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you bridle an' saddle your own horse?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'm ashamed to say I can't,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Time to learn then. Come on. Watch me first when I saddle mine.”\n",

      "Bo was all eyes while Dale slipped off the bridle from his horse and\n",
      "then with slow, plain action readjusted it. Next he smoothed the back of\n",
      "the horse, shook out the blanket, and, folding it half over, he threw\n",
      "it in place, being careful to explain to Bo just the right position. He\n",
      "lifted his saddle in a certain way and put that in place, and then he\n",
      "tightened the cinches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you try,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Helen's judgment Bo might have been a Western girl all her\n",
      "days. But Dale shook his head and made her do it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was better. Of course, the saddle is too heavy for you to sling\n",
      "it up. You can learn that with a light one. Now put the bridle on\n",
      "again. Don't be afraid of your hands. He won't bite. Slip the bit in\n",

      "light, but the wrong way. Watch me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had to mount several times before Dale was satisfied. Then he told\n",
      "her to ride off a little distance. When Bo had gotten out of earshot\n",
      "Dale said to Helen: “She'll take to a horse like a duck takes to water.”\n",
      " Then, mounting, he rode out after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched them trotting and galloping and running the horses round\n",
      "the grassy park, and rather regretted she had not gone with them.\n",
      "Eventually Bo rode back, to dismount and fling herself down, red-cheeked\n",
      "and radiant, with disheveled hair, and curls damp on her temples. How\n",
      "alive she seemed! Helen's senses thrilled with the grace and charm\n",
      "and vitality of this surprising sister, and she was aware of a sheer\n",
      "physical joy in her presence. Bo rested, but she did not rest long. She\n",
      "was soon off to play with Bud. Then she coaxed the tame doe to eat\n",
      "out of her hand. She dragged Helen off for wild flowers, curious and\n",
      "thoughtless by turns. And at length she fell asleep, quickly, in a way\n",
      "that reminded Helen of the childhood now gone forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale called them to dinner about four o'clock, as the sun was reddening\n",
      "the western rampart of the park. Helen wondered where the day had gone.\n",
      "The hours had flown swiftly, serenely, bringing her scarcely a thought\n",
      "of her uncle or dread of her forced detention there or possible\n",
      "discovery by those outlaws supposed to be hunting for her. After\n",
      "she realized the passing of those hours she had an intangible and\n",
      "indescribable feeling of what Dale had meant about dreaming the hours\n",
      "away. The nature of Paradise Park was inimical to the kind of thought\n",
      "that had habitually been hers. She found the new thought absorbing, yet\n",
      "when she tried to name it she found that, after all, she had only felt.\n",
      "At the meal hour she was more than usually quiet. She saw that Dale\n",
      "noticed it and was trying to interest her or distract her attention. He\n",
      "succeeded, but she did not choose to let him see that. She strolled\n",
      "away alone to her seat under the pine. Bo passed her once, and cried,\n",
      "tantalizingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My, Nell, but you're growing romantic!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Never before in Helen's life had the beauty of the evening star seemed\n",
      "so exquisite or the twilight so moving and shadowy or the darkness so\n",
      "charged with loneliness. It was their environment--the accompaniment of\n",
      "wild wolf-mourn, of the murmuring waterfall, of this strange man of the\n",
      "forest and the unfamiliar elements among which he made his home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, her energy having returned, Helen shared Bo's lesson in\n",
      "bridling and saddling her horse, and in riding. Bo, however, rode so\n",
      "fast and so hard that for Helen to share her company was impossible. And\n",
      "Dale, interested and amused, yet anxious, spent most of his time\n",
      "with Bo. It was thus that Helen rode all over the park alone. She was\n",
      "astonished at its size, when from almost any point it looked so small.\n",
      "The atmosphere deceived her. How clearly she could see! And she began to\n",
      "judge distance by the size of familiar things. A horse, looked at across\n",
      "the longest length of the park, seemed very small indeed. Here and\n",
      "there she rode upon dark, swift, little brooks, exquisitely clear and\n",
      "amber-colored and almost hidden from sight by the long grass. These all\n",
      "ran one way, and united to form a deeper brook that apparently wound\n",
      "under the cliffs at the west end, and plunged to an outlet in narrow\n",
      "clefts. When Dale and Bo came to her once she made inquiry, and she was\n",
      "surprised to learn from Dale that this brook disappeared in a hole in\n",
      "the rocks and had an outlet on the other side of the mountain. Sometime\n",
      "he would take them to the lake it formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Over the mountain?” asked Helen, again remembering that she must regard\n",
      "herself as a fugitive. “Will it be safe to leave our hiding-place? I\n",
      "forget so often why we are here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We would be better hidden over there than here,” replied Dale. “The\n",
      "valley on that side is accessible only from that ridge. An' don't worry\n",
      "about bein' found. I told you Roy Beeman is watchin' Anson an' his gang.\n",
      "Roy will keep between them an' us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was reassured, yet there must always linger in the background of\n",
      "her mind a sense of dread. In spite of this, she determined to make the\n",
      "most of her opportunity. Bo was a stimulus. And so Helen spent the rest\n",
      "of that day riding and tagging after her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day was less hard on Helen. Activity, rest, eating, and\n",
      "sleeping took on a wonderful new meaning to her. She had really never\n",
      "known them as strange joys. She rode, she walked, she climbed a little,\n",
      "she dozed under her pine-tree, she worked helping Dale at camp-fire\n",
      "tasks, and when night came she said she did not know herself. That fact\n",
      "haunted her in vague, deep dreams. Upon awakening she forgot her resolve\n",
      "to study herself. That day passed. And then several more went swiftly\n",
      "before she adapted herself to a situation she had reason to believe\n",
      "might last for weeks and even months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was afternoon that Helen loved best of all the time of the day.\n",
      "The sunrise was fresh, beautiful; the morning was windy, fragrant; the\n",
      "sunset was rosy, glorious; the twilight was sad, changing; and night\n",
      "seemed infinitely sweet with its stars and silence and sleep. But the\n",
      "afternoon, when nothing changed, when all was serene, when time seemed\n",
      "to halt, that was her choice, and her solace.\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon she had camp all to herself. Bo was riding. Dale had\n",
      "climbed the mountain to see if he could find any trace of tracks or see\n",
      "any smoke from camp-fire. Bud was nowhere to be seen, nor any of the\n",
      "other pets. Tom had gone off to some sunny ledge where he could bask in\n",
      "the sun, after the habit of the wilder brothers of his species. Pedro\n",
      "had not been seen for a night and a day, a fact that Helen had noted\n",
      "with concern. However, she had forgotten him, and therefore was the more\n",
      "surprised to see him coming limping into camp on three legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Pedro! You have been fighting. Come here,” she called.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hound did not look guilty. He limped to her and held up his right\n",
      "fore paw. The action was unmistakable. Helen examined the injured member\n",
      "and presently found a piece of what looked like mussel-shell embedded\n",
      "deeply between the toes. The wound was swollen, bloody, and evidently\n",
      "very painful. Pedro whined. Helen had to exert all the strength of her\n",
      "fingers to pull it out. Then Pedro howled. But immediately he showed his\n",
      "gratitude by licking her hand. Helen bathed his paw and bound it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Dale returned she related the incident and, showing the piece of\n",
      "shell, she asked: “Where did that come from? Are there shells in the\n",
      "mountains?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once this country was under the sea,” replied Dale. “I've found things\n",
      "that 'd make you wonder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Under the sea!” ejaculated Helen. It was one thing to have read of\n",
      "such a strange fact, but a vastly different one to realize it here among\n",
      "these lofty peaks. Dale was always showing her something or telling her\n",
      "something that astounded her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here,” he said one day. “What do you make of that little bunch of\n",
      "aspens?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were on the farther side of the park and were resting under a\n",
      "pine-tree. The forest here encroached upon the park with its straggling\n",
      "lines of spruce and groves of aspen. The little clump of aspens did not\n",
      "differ from hundreds Helen had seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't make anything particularly of it,” replied Helen, dubiously.\n",
      "“Just a tiny grove of aspens--some very small, some larger, but none\n",
      "very big. But it's pretty with its green and yellow leaves fluttering\n",
      "and quivering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It doesn't make you think of a fight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fight? No, it certainly does not,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it's as good an example of fight, of strife, of selfishness, as\n",
      "you will find in the forest,” he said. “Now come over, you an' Bo, an'\n",
      "let me show you what I mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, Nell,” cried Bo, with enthusiasm. “He'll open our eyes some\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing loath, Helen went with them to the little clump of aspens.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About a hundred altogether,” said Dale. “They're pretty well shaded by\n",
      "the spruces, but they get the sunlight from east an' south. These little\n",
      "trees all came from the same seedlings. They're all the same age. Four\n",
      "of them stand, say, ten feet or more high an' they're as large around as\n",
      "my wrist. Here's one that's largest. See how full-foliaged he is--how he\n",
      "stands over most of the others, but not so much over these four next to\n",
      "him. They all stand close together, very close, you see. Most of them\n",
      "are no larger than my thumb. Look how few branches they have, an' none\n",
      "low down. Look at how few leaves. Do you see how all the branches stand\n",
      "out toward the east an' south--how the leaves, of course, face the same\n",
      "way? See how one branch of one tree bends aside one from another tree.\n",
      "That's a fight for the sunlight. Here are one--two--three dead trees.\n",
      "Look, I can snap them off. An' now look down under them. Here are little\n",
      "trees five feet high--four feet high--down to these only a foot\n",
      "high. Look how pale, delicate, fragile, unhealthy! They get so little\n",
      "sunshine. They were born with the other trees, but did not get an equal\n",
      "start. Position gives the advantage, perhaps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale led the girls around the little grove, illustrating his words by\n",
      "action. He seemed deeply in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You understand it's a fight for water an' sun. But mostly sun, because,\n",
      "if the leaves can absorb the sun, the tree an' roots will grow to grasp\n",
      "the needed moisture. Shade is death--slow death to the life of trees.\n",
      "These little aspens are fightin' for place in the sunlight. It is a\n",
      "merciless battle. They push an' bend one another's branches aside an'\n",
      "choke them. Only perhaps half of these aspens will survive, to make one\n",
      "of the larger clumps, such as that one of full-grown trees over there.\n",
      "One season will give advantage to this saplin' an' next year to that\n",
      "one. A few seasons' advantage to one assures its dominance over the\n",
      "others. But it is never sure of holdin' that dominance. An 'if wind or\n",
      "storm or a strong-growin' rival does not overthrow it, then sooner or\n",
      "later old age will. For there is absolute and continual fight. What is\n",
      "true of these aspens is true of all the trees in the forest an' of all\n",
      "plant life in the forest. What is most wonderful to me is the tenacity\n",
      "of life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And next day Dale showed them an even more striking example of this\n",
      "mystery of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "He guided them on horseback up one of the thick, verdant-wooded slopes,\n",
      "calling their attention at various times to the different growths, until\n",
      "they emerged on the summit of the ridge where the timber grew scant\n",
      "and dwarfed. At the edge of timber-line he showed a gnarled and knotted\n",
      "spruce-tree, twisted out of all semblance to a beautiful spruce, bent\n",
      "and storm-blasted, with almost bare branches, all reaching one' way. The\n",
      "tree was a specter. It stood alone. It had little green upon it. There\n",
      "seemed something tragic about its contortions. But it was alive and\n",
      "strong. It had no rivals to take sun or moisture. Its enemies were the\n",
      "snow and wind and cold of the heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt, as the realization came to her, the knowledge Dale wished\n",
      "to impart, that it was as sad as wonderful, and as mysterious as it was\n",
      "inspiring. At that moment there were both the sting and sweetness of\n",
      "life--the pain and the joy--in Helen's heart. These strange facts\n",
      "were going to teach her--to transform her. And even if they hurt, she\n",
      "welcomed them.\n",

      "“I'll ride you if it breaks--my neck!” panted Bo, passionately, shaking\n",
      "her gloved fist at the gray pony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood near with a broad smile on his face. Helen was within\n",
      "earshot, watching from the edge of the park, and she felt so fascinated\n",
      "and frightened that she could not call out for Bo to stop. The little\n",
      "gray mustang was a beauty, clean-limbed and racy, with long black mane\n",
      "and tail, and a fine, spirited head. There was a blanket strapped on his\n",
      "back, but no saddle. Bo held the short halter that had been fastened\n",
      "in a hackamore knot round his nose. She wore no coat; her blouse was\n",
      "covered with grass and seeds, and it was open at the neck; her hair hung\n",
      "loose and disheveled; one side of her face bore a stain of grass and\n",
      "dirt and a suspicion of blood; the other was red and white; her eyes\n",
      "blazed; beads of sweat stood out on her brow and wet places shone on her\n",
      "cheeks. As she began to strain on the halter, pulling herself closer\n",
      "to the fiery pony, the outline of her slender shape stood out lithe and\n",
      "strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had been defeated in her cherished and determined ambition to ride\n",
      "Dale's mustang, and she was furious. The mustang did not appear to be\n",
      "vicious or mean. But he was spirited, tricky, mischievous, and he had\n",
      "thrown her six times. The scene of Bo's defeat was at the edge of the\n",
      "park, where thick moss and grass afforded soft places for her to fall.\n",
      "It also afforded poor foothold for the gray mustang, obviously placing\n",
      "him at a disadvantage. Dale did not bridle him, because he had not been\n",
      "broken to a bridle; and though it was harder for Bo to try to ride him\n",
      "bareback, there was less risk of her being hurt. Bo had begun in all\n",
      "eagerness and enthusiasm, loving and petting the mustang, which she\n",
      "named “Pony.” She had evidently anticipated an adventure, but her\n",
      "smiling, resolute face had denoted confidence. Pony had stood fairly\n",
      "well to be mounted, and then had pitched and tossed until Bo had slid\n",
      "off or been upset or thrown. After each fall Bo bounced up with less of\n",
      "a smile, and more of spirit, until now the Western passion to master a\n",
      "horse had suddenly leaped to life within her. It was no longer fun, no\n",
      "more a daring circus trick to scare Helen and rouse Dale's admiration.\n",
      "The issue now lay between Bo and the mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pony reared, snorting, tossing his head, and pawing with front feet.\n",
      "\n",

      "Bo did not have much weight, but she had strength, an she hauled with\n",
      "all her might, finally bringing him down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now hold hard an' take up rope an' get in to him,” called Dale. “Good!\n",
      "You're sure not afraid of him. He sees that. Now hold him, talk to him,\n",
      "tell him you're goin' to ride him. Pet him a little. An' when he quits\n",
      "shakin', grab his mane an' jump up an' slide a leg over him. Then hook\n",
      "your feet under him, hard as you can, an' stick on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If Helen had not been so frightened for Bo she would have been able to\n",
      "enjoy her other sensations. Creeping, cold thrills chased over her as\n",
      "Bo, supple and quick, slid an arm and a leg over Pony and straightened\n",
      "up on him with a defiant cry. Pony jerked his head down, brought his\n",
      "feet together in one jump, and began to bounce. Bo got the swing of him\n",
      "this time and stayed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're ridin' him,” yelled Dale. “Now squeeze hard with your knees.\n",

      "an' you'll have him beat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mustang pitched all over the space adjacent to Dale and Helen,\n",
      "tearing up the moss and grass. Several times he tossed Bo high, but she\n",
      "slid back to grip him again with her legs, and he could not throw her.\n",
      "Suddenly he raised his head and bolted. Dale answered Bo's triumphant\n",
      "cry. But Pony had not run fifty feet before he tripped and fell,\n",
      "throwing Bo far over his head. As luck would have it--good luck,\n",
      "Dale afterward said--she landed in a boggy place and the force of her\n",
      "momentum was such that she slid several yards, face down, in wet moss\n",
      "and black ooze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen uttered a scream and ran forward. Bo was getting to her knees when\n",
      "Dale reached her. He helped her up and half led, half carried her out\n",
      "of the boggy place. Bo was not recognizable. From head to foot she was\n",
      "dripping black ooze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Bo! Are you hurt?” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",

      "lit in? Dale, the sun-of-a-gun didn't throw me. He fell, and I went over\n",
      "his head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right. You sure rode him. An' he tripped an' slung you a mile,” replied\n",

      "object that had ever come before her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell Rayner--are you--laughing--at me?” demanded Bo, in most righteous\n",
      "amaze and anger.\n",

      "Dale was laughing, too, but noiselessly, and Bo, being blind for the\n",
      "moment, could not be aware of that. By this time they had reached camp.\n",
      "Helen fell flat and laughed as she had never laughed before. When Helen\n",
      "forgot herself so far as to roll on the ground it was indeed a laughing\n",
      "matter. Dale's big frame shook as he possessed himself of a towel and,\n",
      "wetting it at the spring, began to wipe the mud off Bo's face. But that\n",
      "did not serve. Bo asked to be led to the water, where she knelt and,\n",
      "with splashing, washed out her eyes, and then her face, and then the\n",
      "bedraggled strands of hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That mustang didn't break my neck, but he rooted my face in the mud.\n",

      "Late in the night Helen heard Dale sternly calling Pedro. She felt some\n",
      "little alarm. However, nothing happened, and she soon went to sleep\n",
      "again. At the morning meal Dale explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pedro an' Tom were uneasy last night. I think there are lions workin'\n",
      "over the ridge somewhere. I heard one scream.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scream?” inquired Bo, with interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, an' if you ever hear a lion scream you will think it a woman in\n",
      "mortal agony. The cougar cry, as Roy calls it, is the wildest to be\n",
      "heard in the woods. A wolf howls. He is sad, hungry, and wild. But a\n",
      "cougar seems human an' dyin' an' wild. We'll saddle up an' ride over\n",
      "there. Maybe Pedro will tree a lion. Bo, if he does will you shoot it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure,” replied Bo, with her mouth full of biscuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was how they came to take a long, slow, steep ride under cover of\n",
      "dense spruce. Helen liked the ride after they got on the heights. But\n",
      "they did not get to any point where she could indulge in her pleasure\n",
      "of gazing afar over the ranges. Dale led up and down, and finally mostly\n",
      "down, until they came out within sight of sparser wooded ridges with\n",
      "parks lying below and streams shining in the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than once Pedro had to be harshly called by Dale. The hound scented\n",
      "game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's an old kill,” said Dale, halting to point at some bleached bones\n",
      "scattered under a spruce. Tufts of grayish-white hair lay strewn around.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was it?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Deer, of course. Killed there an' eaten by a lion. Sometime last fall.\n",
      "See, even the skull is split. But I could not say that the lion did it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen shuddered. She thought of the tame deer down at Dale's camp. How\n",
      "beautiful and graceful, and responsive to kindness!\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode out of the woods into a grassy swale with rocks and clumps of\n",
      "some green bushes bordering it. Here Pedro barked, the first time Helen\n",
      "had heard him. The hair on his neck bristled, and it required stern\n",
      "calls from Dale to hold him in. Dale dismounted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hyar, Pede, you get back,” he ordered. “I'll let you go presently....\n",
      "Girls, you're goin' to see somethin'. But stay on your horses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, with the hound tense and bristling beside him, strode here\n",
      "and there at the edge of the swale. Presently he halted on a slight\n",
      "elevation and beckoned for the girls to ride over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, see where the grass is pressed down all nice an' round,” he said,\n",
      "pointing. “A lion made that. He sneaked there, watchin' for deer. That\n",
      "was done this mornin'. Come on, now. Let's see if we can trail him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stooped now, studying the grass, and holding Pedro. Suddenly he\n",
      "straightened up with a flash in his gray eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's where he jumped.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Helen could not see any reason why Dale should say that. The man of\n",
      "the forest took a long stride then another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' here's where that lion lit on the back of the deer. It was a big\n",
      "jump. See the sharp hoof tracks of the deer.” Dale pressed aside tall\n",
      "grass to show dark, rough, fresh tracks of a deer, evidently made by\n",
      "violent action.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on,” called Dale, walking swiftly. “You're sure goin' to see\n",
      "somethin' now.... Here's where the deer bounded, carryin' the lion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” exclaimed Bo, incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The deer was runnin' here with the lion on his back. I'll prove it to\n",
      "you. Come on, now. Pedro, you stay with me. Girls, it's a fresh trail.”\n",
      " Dale walked along, leading his horse, and occasionally he pointed down\n",
      "into the grass. “There! See that! That's hair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen did see some tufts of grayish hair scattered on the ground, and\n",
      "she believed she saw little, dark separations in the grass, where an\n",
      "animal had recently passed. All at once Dale halted. When Helen reached\n",
      "him Bo was already there and they were gazing down at a wide, flattened\n",
      "space in the grass. Even Helen's inexperienced eyes could make out\n",
      "evidences of a struggle. Tufts of gray-white hair lay upon the crushed\n",
      "grass. Helen did not need to see any more, but Dale silently pointed to\n",
      "a patch of blood. Then he spoke:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lion brought the deer down here an' killed him. Probably broke his\n",
      "neck. That deer ran a hundred yards with the lion. See, here's the trail\n",
      "left where the lion dragged the deer off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A well-defined path showed across the swale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, you'll see that deer pretty quick,” declared Dale, starting\n",
      "forward. “This work has just been done. Only a few minutes ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you tell?” queried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! See that grass. It has been bent down by the deer bein' dragged\n",
      "over it. Now it's springin' up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's next stop was on the other side of the swale, under a spruce with\n",
      "low, spreading branches. The look of Pedro quickened Helen's pulse.\n",
      "He was wild to give chase. Fearfully Helen looked where Dale pointed,\n",
      "expecting to see the lion. But she saw instead a deer lying prostrate\n",
      "with tongue out and sightless eyes and bloody hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, that lion heard us an' left. He's not far,” said Dale, as he\n",
      "stooped to lift the head of the deer. “Warm! Neck broken. See the lion's\n",
      "teeth an' claw marks.... It's a doe. Look here. Don't be squeamish,\n",
      "girls. This is only an hourly incident of everyday life in the forest.\n",
      "See where the lion has rolled the skin down as neat as I could do it,\n",
      "an' he'd just begun to bite in there when he heard us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What murderous work, The sight sickens me!” exclaimed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is nature,” said Dale, simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's kill the lion,” added Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "For answer Dale took a quick turn at their saddle-girths, and then,\n",
      "mounting, he called to the hound. “Hunt him up, Pedro.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a shot the hound was off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride in my tracks an' keep close to me,” called Dale, as he wheeled his\n",
      "horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We're off!” squealed Bo, in wild delight, and she made her mount\n",
      "plunge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen urged her horse after them and they broke across a corner of the\n",
      "swale to the woods. Pedro was running straight, with his nose high.\n",
      "He let out one short bark. He headed into the woods, with Dale not far\n",
      "behind. Helen was on one of Dale's best horses, but that fact scarcely\n",
      "manifested itself, because the others began to increase their lead. They\n",
      "entered the woods. It was open, and fairly good going. Bo's horse ran as\n",
      "fast in the woods as he did in the open. That frightened Helen and she\n",
      "yelled to Bo to hold him in. She yelled to deaf ears. That was Bo's\n",
      "great risk--she did not intend to be careful. Suddenly the forest rang\n",
      "with Dale's encouraging yell, meant to aid the girls in following him.\n",
      "Helen's horse caught the spirit of the chase. He gained somewhat on\n",
      "Bo, hurdling logs, sometimes two at once. Helen's blood leaped with a\n",
      "strange excitement, utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless. Yet\n",
      "her natural fear, and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish\n",
      "risk of this ride, shared alike in her sum of sensations. She tried to\n",
      "remember Dale's caution about dodging branches and snags, and sliding\n",
      "her knees back to avoid knocks from trees. She barely missed some\n",
      "frightful reaching branches. She received a hard knock, then another,\n",
      "that unseated her, but frantically she held on and slid back, and at the\n",
      "end of a long run through comparatively open forest she got a stinging\n",
      "blow in the face from a far-spreading branch of pine. Bo missed, by what\n",
      "seemed only an inch, a solid snag that would have broken her in two.\n",
      "Both Pedro and Dale got out of Helen's sight. Then Helen, as she began\n",
      "to lose Bo, felt that she would rather run greater risks than be left\n",
      "behind to get lost in the forest, and she urged her horse. Dale's yell\n",
      "pealed back. Then it seemed even more thrilling to follow by sound than\n",
      "by sight. Wind and brush tore at her. The air was heavily pungent with\n",
      "odor of pine. Helen heard a wild, full bay of the hound, ringing back,\n",
      "full of savage eagerness, and she believed Pedro had roused out the lion\n",
      "from some covert. It lent more stir to her blood and it surely urged her\n",
      "horse on faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the swift pace slackened. A windfall of timber delayed Helen. She\n",
      "caught a glimpse of Dale far ahead, climbing a slope. The forest seemed\n",
      "full of his ringing yell. Helen strangely wished for level ground and\n",
      "the former swift motion. Next she saw Bo working down to the right, and\n",
      "Dale's yell now came from that direction. Helen followed, got out of the\n",
      "timber, and made better time on a gradual slope down to another park.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she reached the open she saw Bo almost across this narrow open\n",
      "ground. Here Helen did not need to urge her mount. He snorted and\n",
      "plunged at the level and he got to going so fast that Helen would\n",
      "have screamed aloud in mingled fear and delight if she had not been\n",
      "breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her horse had the bad luck to cross soft ground. He went to his knees\n",
      "and Helen sailed out of the saddle over his head. Soft willows and wet\n",
      "grass broke her fall. She was surprised to find herself unhurt. Up she\n",
      "bounded and certainly did not know this new Helen Rayner. Her horse was\n",
      "coming, and he had patience with her, but he wanted to hurry. Helen made\n",
      "the quickest mount of her experience and somehow felt a pride in it.\n",
      "She would tell Bo that. But just then Bo flashed into the woods out of\n",
      "sight. Helen fairly charged into that green foliage, breaking brush and\n",
      "branches. She broke through into open forest. Bo was inside, riding down\n",
      "an aisle between pines and spruces. At that juncture Helen heard Dale's\n",
      "melodious yell near at hand. Coming into still more open forest, with\n",
      "rocks here and there, she saw Dale dismounted under a pine, and Pedro\n",
      "standing with fore paws upon the tree-trunk, and then high up on a\n",
      "branch a huge tawny colored lion, just like Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's horse slowed up and showed fear, but he kept on as far as Dale's\n",
      "horse. But Helen's refused to go any nearer. She had difficulty in\n",
      "halting him. Presently she dismounted and, throwing her bridle over a\n",
      "stump, she ran on, panting and fearful, yet tingling all over, up to her\n",
      "sister and Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, you did pretty good for a tenderfoot,” was Bo's greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a fine chase,” said Dale. “You both rode well. I wish you could\n",
      "have seen the lion on the ground. He bounded--great long bounds with\n",
      "his tail up in the air--very funny. An' Pedro almost caught up with him.\n",
      "That scared me, because he would have killed the hound. Pedro was close\n",
      "to him when he treed. An' there he is--the yellow deer-killer. He's a\n",
      "male an' full grown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that Dale pulled his rifle from its saddle-sheath and looked\n",
      "expectantly at Bo. But she was gazing with great interest and admiration\n",
      "up at the lion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn't he just beautiful?” she burst out. “Oh, look at him spit! Just\n",
      "like a cat! Dale, he looks afraid he might fall off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He sure does. Lions are never sure of their balance in a tree. But I\n",
      "never saw one make a misstep. He knows he doesn't belong there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen the lion looked splendid perched up there. He was long and\n",
      "round and graceful and tawny. His tongue hung out and his plump sides\n",
      "heaved, showing what a quick, hard run he had been driven to. What\n",
      "struck Helen most forcibly about him was something in his face as he\n",
      "looked down at the hound. He was scared. He realized his peril. It was\n",
      "not possible for Helen to watch him killed, yet she could not bring\n",
      "herself to beg Bo not to shoot. Helen confessed she was a tenderfoot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get down, Bo, an' let's see how good a shot you are, said Dale. Bo\n",
      "slowly withdrew her fascinated gaze from the lion and looked with a\n",
      "rueful smile at Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've changed my mind. I said I would kill him, but now I can't. He\n",
      "looks so--so different from what I'd imagined.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's answer was a rare smile of understanding and approval that warmed\n",
      "Helen's heart toward him. All the same, he was amused. Sheathing the\n",
      "gun, he mounted his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, Pedro,” he called. “Come, I tell you,” he added, sharply,\n",
      "“Well, girls, we treed him, anyhow, an' it was fun. Now we'll ride back\n",
      "to the deer he killed an' pack a haunch to camp for our own use.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will the lion go back to his--his kill, I think you called it?” asked\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've chased one away from his kill half a dozen times. Lions are not\n",
      "plentiful here an' they don't get overfed. I reckon the balance is\n",
      "pretty even.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This last remark made Helen inquisitive. And as they slowly rode on the\n",
      "back-trail Dale talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You girls, bein' tender-hearted an' not knowin' the life of the forest,\n",
      "what's good an' what's bad, think it was a pity the poor deer was\n",
      "killed by a murderous lion. But you're wrong. As I told you, the lion is\n",
      "absolutely necessary to the health an' joy of wild life--or deer's wild\n",
      "life, so to speak. When deer were created or came into existence,\n",
      "then the lion must have come, too. They can't live without each other.\n",
      "Wolves, now, are not particularly deer-killers. They live off elk an'\n",
      "anythin' they can catch. So will lions, for that matter. But I mean\n",
      "lions follow the deer to an' fro from winter to summer feedin'-grounds.\n",
      "Where there's no deer you will find no lions. Well, now, if left alone\n",
      "deer would multiply very fast. In a few years there would be hundreds\n",
      "where now there's only one. An' in time, as the generations passed,\n",
      "they'd lose the fear, the alertness, the speed an' strength, the\n",
      "eternal vigilance that is love of life--they'd lose that an' begin\n",
      "to deteriorate, an' disease would carry them off. I saw one season of\n",
      "black-tongue among deer. It killed them off, an' I believe that is one\n",
      "of the diseases of over-production. The lions, now, are forever on the\n",
      "trail of the deer. They have learned. Wariness is an instinct born in\n",
      "the fawn. It makes him keen, quick, active, fearful, an' so he grows up\n",
      "strong an' healthy to become the smooth, sleek, beautiful, soft-eyed,\n",
      "an' wild-lookin' deer you girls love to watch. But if it wasn't for\n",
      "the lions, the deer would not thrive. Only the strongest an' swiftest\n",
      "survive. That is the meanin' of nature. There is always a perfect\n",
      "balance kept by nature. It may vary in different years, but on the\n",
      "whole, in the long years, it averages an even balance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How wonderfully you put it!” exclaimed Bo, with all her impulsiveness.\n",
      "“Oh, I'm glad I didn't kill the lion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What you say somehow hurts me,” said Helen, wistfully, to the hunter.\n",
      "“I see--I feel how true--how inevitable it is. But it changes my--my\n",
      "feelings. Almost I'd rather not acquire such knowledge as yours. This\n",
      "balance of nature--how tragic--how sad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why?” asked Dale. “You love birds, an' birds are the greatest\n",
      "killers in the forest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't tell me that--don't prove it,” implored Helen. “It is not so much\n",
      "the love of life in a deer or any creature, and the terrible clinging to\n",
      "life, that gives me distress. It is suffering. I can't bear to see pain.\n",
      "I can STAND pain myself, but I can't BEAR to see or think of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” replied. Dale, thoughtfully, “There you stump me again. I've\n",
      "lived long in the forest an' when a man's alone he does a heap of\n",
      "thinkin'. An' always I couldn't understand a reason or a meanin'\n",
      "for pain. Of all the bafflin' things of life, that is the hardest to\n",
      "understand an' to forgive--pain!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening, as they sat in restful places round the camp-fire, with\n",
      "the still twilight fading into night, Dale seriously asked the girls\n",
      "what the day's chase had meant to them. His manner of asking was\n",
      "productive of thought. Both girls were silent for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Glorious!” was Bo's brief and eloquent reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” asked. Dale, curiously. “You are a girl. You've been used to\n",
      "home, people, love, comfort, safety, quiet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe that is just why it was glorious,” said Bo, earnestly. “I can\n",
      "hardly explain. I loved the motion of the horse, the feel of wind in\n",
      "my face, the smell of the pine, the sight of slope and forest glade and\n",
      "windfall and rocks, and the black shade under the spruces. My blood\n",
      "beat and burned. My teeth clicked. My nerves all quivered. My heart\n",
      "sometimes, at dangerous moments, almost choked me, and all the time it\n",
      "pounded hard. Now my skin was hot and then it was cold. But I think the\n",
      "best of that chase for me was that I was on a fast horse, guiding him,\n",
      "controlling him. He was alive. Oh, how I felt his running!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what you say is as natural to me as if I felt it,” said Dale. “I\n",
      "wondered. You're certainly full of fire, An', Helen, what do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo has answered you with her feelings,” replied Helen, “I could not do\n",
      "that and be honest. The fact that Bo wouldn't shoot the lion after we\n",
      "treed him acquits her. Nevertheless, her answer is purely physical. You\n",
      "know, Mr. Dale, how you talk about the physical. I should say my sister\n",
      "was just a young, wild, highly sensitive, hot-blooded female of the\n",
      "species. She exulted in that chase as an Indian. Her sensations were\n",
      "inherited ones--certainly not acquired by education. Bo always hated\n",
      "study. The ride was a revelation to me. I had a good many of Bo's\n",
      "feelings--though not so strong. But over against them was the opposition\n",
      "of reason, of consciousness. A new-born side of my nature confronted me,\n",
      "strange, surprising, violent, irresistible. It was as if another side of\n",
      "my personality suddenly said: 'Here I am. Reckon with me now!' And there\n",
      "was no use for the moment to oppose that strange side. I--the thinking\n",
      "Helen Rayner, was powerless. Oh yes, I had such thoughts even when the\n",
      "branches were stinging my face and I was thrilling to the bay of the\n",
      "hound. Once my horse fell and threw me.... You needn't look alarmed.\n",
      "It was fine. I went into a soft place and was unhurt. But when I was\n",
      "sailing through the air a thought flashed: this is the end of me! It was\n",
      "like a dream when you are falling dreadfully. Much of what I felt and\n",
      "thought on that chase must have been because of what I have studied and\n",
      "read and taught. The reality of it, the action and flash, were splendid.\n",
      "But fear of danger, pity for the chased lion, consciousness of foolish\n",
      "risk, of a reckless disregard for the serious responsibility I have\n",
      "taken--all these worked in my mind and held back what might have been a\n",
      "sheer physical, primitive joy of the wild moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale listened intently, and after Helen had finished he studied the fire\n",
      "and thoughtfully poked the red embers with his stick. His face was still\n",
      "and serene, untroubled and unlined, but to Helen his eyes seemed sad,\n",
      "pensive, expressive of an unsatisfied yearning and wonder. She had\n",
      "carefully and earnestly spoken, because she was very curious to hear\n",
      "what he might say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand you,” he replied, presently. “An' I'm sure surprised that\n",
      "I can. I've read my books--an' reread them, but no one ever talked like\n",
      "that to me. What I make of it is this. You've the same blood in you\n",
      "that's in Bo. An' blood is stronger than brain. Remember that blood is\n",
      "life. It would be good for you to have it run an' beat an' burn, as\n",
      "Bo's did. Your blood did that a thousand years or ten thousand before\n",
      "intellect was born in your ancestors. Instinct may not be greater than\n",
      "reason, but it's a million years older. Don't fight your instincts so\n",
      "hard. If they were not good the God of Creation would not have given\n",
      "them to you. To-day your mind was full of self-restraint that did not\n",
      "altogether restrain. You couldn't forget yourself. You couldn't FEEL\n",
      "only, as Bo did. You couldn't be true to your real nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't agree with you,” replied Helen, quickly. “I don't have to be an\n",
      "Indian to be true to myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes you do,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I couldn't be an Indian,” declared Helen, spiritedly. “I couldn't\n",
      "FEEL only, as you say Bo did. I couldn't go back in the scale, as you\n",
      "hint. What would all my education amount to--though goodness knows it's\n",
      "little enough--if I had no control over primitive feelings that happened\n",
      "to be born in me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll have little or no control over them when the right time comes,”\n",
      " replied Dale. “Your sheltered life an' education have led you away from\n",
      "natural instincts. But they're in you an' you'll learn the proof of that\n",
      "out here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Not if I lived a hundred years in the West,” asserted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, child, do you know what you're talkin' about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Bo let out a blissful peal of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dale!” exclaimed Helen, almost affronted. She was stirred. “I know\n",
      "MYSELF, at least.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you do not. You've no idea of yourself. You've education, yes, but\n",
      "not in nature an' life. An' after all, they are the real things. Answer\n",
      "me, now--honestly, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, if I can. Some of your questions are hard to answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever been starved?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever been lost away from home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever faced death--real stark an' naked death, close an'\n",
      "terrible?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever wanted to kill any one with your bare hands?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Dale, you--you amaze me. No!... No!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I know your answer to my last question, but I'll ask it,\n",
      "anyhow.... Have you ever been so madly in love with a man that you could\n",
      "not live without him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo fell off her seat with a high, trilling laugh. “Oh, you two are\n",
      "great!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank Heaven, I haven't been,” replied Helen, shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you don't know anythin' about life,” declared Dale, with finality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was not to be put down by that, dubious and troubled as it made\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you experienced all those things?” she queried, stubbornly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All but the last one. Love never came my way. How could it? I live\n",
      "alone. I seldom go to the villages where there are girls. No girl would\n",
      "ever care for me. I have nothin'.... But, all the same, I understand\n",
      "love a little, just by comparison with strong feelin's I've lived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched the hunter and marveled at his simplicity. His sad and\n",
      "penetrating gaze was on the fire, as if in its white heart to read the\n",
      "secret denied him. He had said that no girl would ever love him. She\n",
      "imagined he might know considerably less about the nature of girls than\n",
      "of the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To come back to myself,” said Helen, wanting to continue the argument.\n",
      "“You declared I didn't know myself. That I would have no self-control. I\n",
      "will!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I meant the big things of life,” he said, patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What things?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you. By askin' what had never happened to you I learned what\n",
      "will happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those experiences to come to ME!” breathed Helen, incredulously.\n",
      "“Never!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sister Nell, they sure will--particularly the last-named one--the mad\n",
      "love,” chimed in Bo, mischievously, yet believingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Dale nor Helen appeared to hear her interruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me put it simpler,” began Dale, evidently racking his brain for\n",
      "analogy. His perplexity appeared painful to him, because he had a great\n",
      "faith, a great conviction that he could not make clear. “Here I am,\n",
      "the natural physical man, livin' in the wilds. An' here you come, the\n",
      "complex, intellectual woman. Remember, for my argument's sake, that\n",
      "you're here. An' suppose circumstances forced you to stay here. You'd\n",
      "fight the elements with me an' work with me to sustain life. There\n",
      "must be a great change in either you or me, accordin' to the other's\n",
      "influence. An' can't you see that change must come in you, not because\n",
      "of anythin' superior in me--I'm really inferior to you--but because of\n",
      "our environment? You'd lose your complexity. An' in years to come you'd\n",
      "be a natural physical woman, because you'd live through an' by the\n",
      "physical.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear, will not education be of help to the Western woman?” queried\n",
      "Helen, almost in despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure it will,” answered Dale, promptly. “What the West needs is women\n",
      "who can raise an' teach children. But you don't understand me. You don't\n",
      "get under your skin. I reckon I can't make you see my argument as I feel\n",
      "it. You take my word for this, though. Sooner or later you WILL wake up\n",
      "an' forget yourself. Remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll bet you do, too,” said Bo, seriously for her. “It may seem\n",
      "strange to you, but I understand Dale. I feel what he means. It's a sort\n",
      "of shock. Nell, we're not what we seem. We're not what we fondly imagine\n",
      "we are. We've lived too long with people--too far away from the earth.\n",
      "You know the Bible says something like this: 'Dust thou art and to dust\n",
      "thou shalt return.' Where DO we come from?”\n",

      "CHAPTER XII\n",
      "\n",
      "Days passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every morning Helen awoke with a wondering question as to what this\n",
      "day would bring forth, especially with regard to possible news from her\n",
      "uncle. It must come sometime and she was anxious for it. Something about\n",
      "this simple, wild camp life had begun to grip her. She found herself\n",
      "shirking daily attention to the clothes she had brought West. They\n",
      "needed it, but she had begun to see how superficial they really were.\n",
      "On the other hand, camp-fire tasks had come to be a pleasure. She had\n",
      "learned a great deal more about them than had Bo. Worry and dread\n",
      "were always impinging upon the fringe of her thoughts--always vaguely\n",
      "present, though seldom annoying. They were like shadows in dreams. She\n",
      "wanted to get to her uncle's ranch, to take up the duties of her new\n",
      "life. But she was not prepared to believe she would not regret this wild\n",
      "experience. She must get away from that in order to see it clearly, and\n",
      "she began to have doubts of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the active and restful outdoor life went on. Bo leaned more\n",
      "and more toward utter reconciliation to it. Her eyes had a wonderful\n",
      "flash, like blue lightning; her cheeks were gold and brown; her hands\n",
      "tanned dark as an Indian's.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could vault upon the gray mustang, or, for that matter, clear over\n",
      "his back. She learned to shoot a rifle accurately enough to win Dale's\n",
      "praise, and vowed she would like to draw a bead upon a grizzly bear or\n",
      "upon Snake Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, if you met that grizzly Dale said has been prowling round camp\n",
      "lately you'd run right up a tree,” declared Helen, one morning, when Bo\n",
      "seemed particularly boastful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't fool yourself,” retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I've seen you run from a mouse!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sister, couldn't I be afraid of a mouse and not a bear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't see how.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, bears, lions, outlaws, and other wild beasts are to be met with\n",
      "here in the West, and my mind's made up,” said Bo, in slow-nodding\n",
      "deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "They argued as they had always argued, Helen for reason and common sense\n",
      "and restraint, Bo on the principle that if she must fight it was better\n",
      "to get in the first blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning on which this argument took place Dale was a long time in\n",
      "catching the horses. When he did come in he shook his head seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some varmint's been chasin' the horses,” he said, as he reached for his\n",
      "saddle. “Did you hear them snortin' an' runnin' last night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of the girls had been awakened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I missed one of the colts,” went on Dale, “an' I'm goin' to ride across\n",
      "the park.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's movements were quick and stern. It was significant that he chose\n",
      "his heavier rifle, and, mounting, with a sharp call to Pedro, he rode\n",
      "off without another word to the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo watched him for a moment and then began to saddle the mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't follow him?” asked Helen, quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sure will,” replied Bo. “He didn't forbid it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he certainly did not want us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might not want you, but I'll bet he wouldn't object to me,\n",
      "whatever's up,” said Bo, shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So you think--” exclaimed Helen, keenly hurt. She bit her tongue to\n",
      "keep back a hot reply. And it was certain that a bursting gush of anger\n",
      "flooded over her. Was she, then, such a coward? Did Dale think this\n",
      "slip of a sister, so wild and wilful, was a stronger woman than she? A\n",
      "moment's silent strife convinced her that no doubt he thought so and\n",
      "no doubt he was right. Then the anger centered upon herself, and Helen\n",
      "neither understood nor trusted herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome proved an uncontrollable impulse. Helen began to saddle her\n",
      "horse. She had the task half accomplished when Bo's call made her look\n",
      "up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen heard a ringing, wild bay of the hound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's Pedro,” she said, with a thrill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. He's running. We never heard him bay like that before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Dale?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He rode out of sight across there,” replied Bo, pointing. “And Pedro's\n",
      "running toward us along that slope. He must be a mile--two miles from\n",
      "Dale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Dale will follow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. But he'd need wings to get near that hound now. Pedro couldn't\n",
      "have gone across there with him... just listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wild note of the hound manifestly stirred Bo to irrepressible\n",
      "action. Snatching up Dale's lighter rifle, she shoved it into her\n",
      "saddle-sheath, and, leaping on the mustang, she ran him over brush and\n",
      "brook, straight down the park toward the place Pedro was climbing. For\n",
      "an instant Helen stood amazed beyond speech. When Bo sailed over a big\n",
      "log, like a steeple-chaser, then Helen answered to further unconsidered\n",
      "impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened. Without coat or hat\n",
      "she mounted. The nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the\n",
      "saddle. A strange, trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins.\n",
      "She wanted to scream for Bo to wait. Bo was out of sight, but the deep,\n",
      "muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded\n",
      "Helen an easy trail to follow. In fact, her horse needed no guiding. He\n",
      "ran in and out of the straggling spruces along the edge of the park, and\n",
      "suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang\n",
      "standing still. Bo was looking up and listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There he is!” cried Bo, as the hound bayed ringingly, closer to them\n",
      "this time, and she spurred away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's horse followed without urging. He was excited. His ears were up.\n",
      "Something was in the wind. Helen had never ridden along this broken end\n",
      "of the park, and Bo was not easy to keep up with. She led across bogs,\n",
      "brooks, swales, rocky little ridges, through stretches of timber and\n",
      "groves of aspen so thick Helen could scarcely squeeze through. Then\n",
      "Bo came out into a large open offshoot of the park, right under the\n",
      "mountain slope, and here she sat, her horse watching and listening.\n",
      "Helen rode up to her, imagining once that she had heard the hound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! Look!” Bo's scream made her mustang stand almost straight up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed up to see a big brown bear with a frosted coat go lumbering\n",
      "across an opening on the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a grizzly! He'll kill Pedro! Oh, where is Dale!” cried Bo, with\n",
      "intense excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! That bear is running down! We--we must get--out of his road,”\n",
      " panted Helen, in breathless alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale hasn't had time to be close.... Oh, I wish he'd come! I don't know\n",
      "what to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride back. At least wait for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Pedro spoke differently, in savage barks, and following that\n",
      "came a loud growl and crashings in the brush. These sounds appeared to\n",
      "be not far up the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! Do you hear? Pedro's fighting the bear,” burst out Bo. Her face\n",
      "paled, her eyes flashed like blue steel. “The bear 'll kill him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, that would be dreadful!” replied Helen, in distress. “But what on\n",
      "earth can we do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“HEL-LO, DALE!” called Bo, at the highest pitch of her piercing voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer came. A heavy crash of brush, a rolling of stones, another\n",
      "growl from the slope told Helen that the hound had brought the bear to\n",
      "bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm going up,” said Bo, deliberately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No-no! Are you mad?” returned Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bear will kill Pedro.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might kill you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ride that way and yell for Dale,” rejoined Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What will--you do?” gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll shoot at the bear--scare him off. If he chases me he can't catch\n",
      "me coming downhill. Dale said that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're crazy!” cried Helen, as Bo looked up the slope, searching for\n",
      "open ground. Then she pulled the rifle from its sheath.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bo did not hear or did not care. She spurred the mustang, and he,\n",
      "wild to run, flung grass and dirt from his heels. What Helen would have\n",
      "done then she never knew, but the fact was that her horse bolted after\n",
      "the mustang. In an instant, seemingly, Bo had disappeared in the gold\n",
      "and green of the forest slope. Helen's mount climbed on a run, snorting\n",
      "and heaving, through aspens, brush, and timber, to come out into a\n",
      "narrow, long opening extending lengthwise up the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden prolonged crash ahead alarmed Helen and halted her horse. She\n",
      "saw a shaking of aspens. Then a huge brown beast leaped as a cat out of\n",
      "the woods. It was a bear of enormous size. Helen's heart stopped--her\n",
      "tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. The bear turned. His mouth was\n",
      "open, red and dripping. He looked shaggy, gray. He let out a terrible\n",
      "bawl. Helen's every muscle froze stiff. Her horse plunged high and\n",
      "sidewise, wheeling almost in the air, neighing his terror. Like a stone\n",
      "she dropped from the saddle. She did not see the horse break into the\n",
      "woods, but she heard him. Her gaze never left the bear even while she\n",
      "was falling, and it seemed she alighted in an upright position with her\n",
      "back against a bush. It upheld her. The bear wagged his huge head from\n",
      "side to side. Then, as the hound barked close at hand, he turned to run\n",
      "heavily uphill and out of the opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant of his disappearance was one of collapse for Helen. Frozen\n",
      "with horror, she had been unable to move or feel or think. All at once\n",
      "she was a quivering mass of cold, helpless flesh, wet with perspiration,\n",
      "sick with a shuddering, retching, internal convulsion, her mind\n",
      "liberated from paralyzing shock. The moment was as horrible as that\n",
      "in which the bear had bawled his frightful rage. A stark, icy, black\n",
      "emotion seemed in possession of her. She could not lift a hand, yet all\n",
      "of her body appeared shaking. There was a fluttering, a strangling in\n",
      "her throat. The crushing weight that surrounded her heart eased before\n",
      "she recovered use of her limbs. Then, the naked and terrible thing was\n",
      "gone, like a nightmare giving way to consciousness. What blessed relief!\n",
      "Helen wildly gazed about her. The bear and hound were out of sight, and\n",
      "so was her horse. She stood up very dizzy and weak. Thought of Bo then\n",
      "seemed to revive her, to shock different life and feeling throughout all\n",
      "her cold extremities. She listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard a thudding of hoofs down the slope, then Dale's clear, strong\n",
      "call. She answered. It appeared long before he burst out of the woods,\n",
      "riding hard and leading her horse. In that time she recovered fully,\n",
      "and when he reached her, to put a sudden halt upon the fiery Ranger, she\n",
      "caught the bridle he threw and swiftly mounted her horse. The feel of\n",
      "the saddle seemed different. Dale's piercing gray glance thrilled her\n",
      "strangely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're white. Are you hurt?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I was scared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he threw you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, he certainly threw me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What happened?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We heard the hound and we rode along the timber. Then we saw the\n",
      "bear--a monster--white--coated--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know. It's a grizzly. He killed the colt--your pet. Hurry now. What\n",
      "about Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pedro was fighting the bear. Bo said he'd be killed. She rode right up\n",
      "here. My horse followed. I couldn't have stopped him. But we lost Bo.\n",
      "Right there the bear came out. He roared. My horse threw me and ran off.\n",
      "Pedro's barking saved me--my life, I think. Oh! that was awful! Then the\n",
      "bear went up--there.... And you came.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo's followin' the hound!” ejaculated Dale. And, lifting his hands to\n",
      "his mouth, he sent out a stentorian yell that rolled up the slope, rang\n",
      "against the cliffs, pealed and broke and died away. Then he waited,\n",
      "listening. From far up the slope came a faint, wild cry, high-pitched\n",
      "and sweet, to create strange echoes, floating away to die in the\n",
      "ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's after him!” declared Dale, grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo's got your rifle,” said Helen. “Oh, we must hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You go back,” ordered Dale, wheeling his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” Helen felt that word leave her lips with the force of a bullet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale spurred Ranger and took to the open slope. Helen kept at his heels\n",
      "until timber was reached. Here a steep trail led up. Dale dismounted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Horse tracks--bear tracks--dog tracks,” he said, bending over. “We'll\n",
      "have to walk up here. It'll save our horses an' maybe time, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Bo riding up there?” asked Helen, eying the steep ascent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She sure is.” With that Dale started up, leading his horse. Helen\n",
      "followed. It was rough and hard work. She was lightly clad, yet soon she\n",
      "was hot, laboring, and her heart began to hurt. When Dale halted to\n",
      "rest Helen was just ready to drop. The baying of the hound, though\n",
      "infrequent, inspirited her. But presently that sound was lost. Dale said\n",
      "bear and hound had gone over the ridge and as soon as the top was gained\n",
      "he would hear them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look there,” he said, presently, pointing to fresh tracks, larger than\n",
      "those made by Bo's mustang. “Elk tracks. We've scared a big bull an'\n",
      "he's right ahead of us. Look sharp an' you'll see him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen never climbed so hard and fast before, and when they reached the\n",
      "ridge-top she was all tuckered out. It was all she could do to get on\n",
      "her horse. Dale led along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the\n",
      "western end, which was considerably higher. In places open rocky ground\n",
      "split the green timber. Dale pointed toward a promontory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen saw a splendid elk silhouetted against the sky. He was a light\n",
      "gray over all his hindquarters, with shoulders and head black. His\n",
      "ponderous, wide-spread antlers towered over him, adding to the wildness\n",
      "of his magnificent poise as he stood there, looking down into the\n",
      "valley, no doubt listening for the bay of the hound. When he heard\n",
      "Dale's horse he gave one bound, gracefully and wonderfully carrying his\n",
      "antlers, to disappear in the green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again on a bare patch of ground Dale pointed down. Helen saw big round\n",
      "tracks, toeing in a little, that gave her a chill. She knew these were\n",
      "grizzly tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard riding was not possible on this ridge crest, a fact that gave Helen\n",
      "time to catch her breath. At length, coming out upon the very summit\n",
      "of the mountain, Dale heard the hound. Helen's eyes feasted afar upon\n",
      "a wild scene of rugged grandeur, before she looked down on this western\n",
      "slope at her feet to see bare, gradual descent, leading down to sparsely\n",
      "wooded bench and on to deep-green canuon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride hard now!” yelled Dale. “I see Bo, an' I'll have to ride to catch\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale spurred down the slope. Helen rode in his tracks and, though she\n",
      "plunged so fast that she felt her hair stand up with fright, she saw him\n",
      "draw away from her. Sometimes her horse slid on his haunches for a\n",
      "few yards, and at these hazardous moments she got her feet out of the\n",
      "stirrups so as to fall free from him if he went down. She let him choose\n",
      "the way, while she gazed ahead at Dale, and then farther on, in the hope\n",
      "of seeing Bo. At last she was rewarded. Far Down the wooded bench she\n",
      "saw a gray flash of the little mustang and a bright glint of Bo's hair.\n",
      "Her heart swelled. Dale would soon overhaul Bo and come between her and\n",
      "peril. And on the instant, though Helen was unconscious of it then,\n",
      "a remarkable change came over her spirit. Fear left her. And a hot,\n",
      "exalting, incomprehensible something took possession of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She let the horse run, and when he had plunged to the foot of that slope\n",
      "of soft ground he broke out across the open bench at a pace that made\n",
      "the wind bite Helen's cheeks and roar in her ears. She lost sight of\n",
      "Dale. It gave her a strange, grim exultance. She bent her eager gaze to\n",
      "find the tracks of his horse, and she found them. Also she made out the\n",
      "tracks of Bo's mustang and the bear and the hound. Her horse, scenting\n",
      "game, perhaps, and afraid to be left alone, settled into a fleet and\n",
      "powerful stride, sailing over logs and brush. That open bench had looked\n",
      "short, but it was long, and Helen rode down the gradual descent at\n",
      "breakneck speed. She would not be left behind. She had awakened to a\n",
      "heedlessness of risk. Something burned steadily within her. A grim, hard\n",
      "anger of joy! When she saw, far down another open, gradual descent, that\n",
      "Dale had passed Bo and that Bo was riding the little mustang as never\n",
      "before, then Helen flamed with a madness to catch her, to beat her in\n",
      "that wonderful chase, to show her and Dale what there really was in the\n",
      "depths of Helen Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ambition was to be short-lived, she divined from the lay of the land\n",
      "ahead, but the ride she lived then for a flying mile was something that\n",
      "would always blanch her cheeks and prick her skin in remembrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The open ground was only too short. That thundering pace soon brought\n",
      "Helen's horse to the timber. Here it took all her strength to check his\n",
      "headlong flight over deadfalls and between small jack-pines. Helen lost\n",
      "sight of Bo, and she realized it would take all her wits to keep from\n",
      "getting lost. She had to follow the trail, and in some places it was\n",
      "hard to see from horseback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, her horse was mettlesome, thoroughly aroused, and he wanted a\n",
      "free rein and his own way. Helen tried that, only to lose the trail and\n",
      "to get sundry knocks from trees and branches. She could not hear the\n",
      "hound, nor Dale. The pines were small, close together, and tough. They\n",
      "were hard to bend. Helen hurt her hands, scratched her face, barked her\n",
      "knees. The horse formed a habit suddenly of deciding to go the way he\n",
      "liked instead of the way Helen guided him, and when he plunged between\n",
      "saplings too close to permit easy passage it was exceedingly hard on\n",
      "her. That did not make any difference to Helen. Once worked into a\n",
      "frenzy, her blood stayed at high pressure. She did not argue with\n",
      "herself about a need of desperate hurry. Even a blow on the head that\n",
      "nearly blinded her did not in the least retard her. The horse could\n",
      "hardly be held, and not at all in the few open places.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Helen reached another slope. Coming out upon canuon rim, she\n",
      "heard Dale's clear call, far down, and Bo's answering peal, high and\n",
      "piercing, with its note of exultant wildness. Helen also heard the bear\n",
      "and the hound fighting at the bottom of this canuon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Helen again missed the tracks made by Dale and Bo. The descent\n",
      "looked impassable. She rode back along the rim, then forward. Finally\n",
      "she found where the ground had been plowed deep by hoofs, down over\n",
      "little banks. Helen's horse balked at these jumps. When she goaded him\n",
      "over them she went forward on his neck. It seemed like riding straight\n",
      "downhill. The mad spirit of that chase grew more stingingly keen to\n",
      "Helen as the obstacles grew. Then, once more the bay of the hound and\n",
      "the bawl of the bear made a demon of her horse. He snorted a shrill\n",
      "defiance. He plunged with fore hoofs in the air. He slid and broke a way\n",
      "down the steep, soft banks, through the thick brush and thick clusters\n",
      "of saplings, sending loose rocks and earth into avalanches ahead of him.\n",
      "He fell over one bank, but a thicket of aspens upheld him so that he\n",
      "rebounded and gained his feet. The sounds of fight ceased, but Dale's\n",
      "thrilling call floated up on the pine-scented air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Helen realized it she was at the foot of the slope, in a narrow\n",
      "canuon-bed, full of rocks and trees, with a soft roar of running water\n",
      "filling her ears. Tracks were everywhere, and when she came to the first\n",
      "open place she saw where the grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into\n",
      "the water. Here he had fought Pedro. Signs of that battle were easy to\n",
      "read. Helen saw where his huge tracks, still wet, led up the opposite\n",
      "sandy bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then down-stream Helen did some more reckless and splendid riding. On\n",
      "level ground the horse was great. Once he leaped clear across the brook.\n",
      "Every plunge, every turn Helen expected to come upon Dale and Bo facing\n",
      "the bear. The canuon narrowed, the stream-bed deepened. She had to slow\n",
      "down to get through the trees and rocks. Quite unexpectedly she rode\n",
      "pell-mell upon Dale and Bo and the panting Pedro. Her horse plunged to a\n",
      "halt, answering the shrill neighs of the other horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale gazed in admiring amazement at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, did you meet the bear again?” he queried, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Didn't--you--kill him?” panted Helen, slowly sagging in her saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He got away in the rocks. Rough country down here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen slid off her horse and fell with a little panting cry of relief.\n",
      "She saw that she was bloody, dirty, disheveled, and wringing wet with\n",
      "perspiration. Her riding habit was torn into tatters. Every muscle\n",
      "seemed to burn and sting, and all her bones seemed broken. But it was\n",
      "worth all this to meet Dale's penetrating glance, to see Bo's utter,\n",
      "incredulous astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--Rayner!” gasped Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If--my horse 'd been--any good--in the woods,” panted Helen, “I'd not\n",
      "lost--so much time--riding down this mountain. And I'd caught you--beat\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girl, did you RIDE down this last slope?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sure did,” replied Helen, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We walked every step of the way, and was lucky to get down at that,”\n",
      " responded Dale, gravely. “No horse should have been ridden down there.\n",
      "Why, he must have slid down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We slid--yes. But I stayed on him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's incredulity changed to wondering, speechless admiration. And Dale's\n",
      "rare smile changed his gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm sorry. It was rash of me. I thought you'd go back.... But all's\n",
      "well that ends well.... Helen, did you wake up to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She dropped her eyes, not caring to meet the questioning gaze upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe--a little,” she replied, and she covered her face with her hands.\n",
      "Remembrance of his questions--of his assurance that she did not know\n",
      "the real meaning of life--of her stubborn antagonism--made her somehow\n",
      "ashamed. But it was not for long.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The chase was great,” she said. “I did not know myself. You were\n",
      "right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In how many ways did you find me right?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think all--but one,” she replied, with a laugh and a shudder. “I'm\n",
      "near starved NOW--I was so furious at Bo that I could have choked her. I\n",
      "faced that horrible brute.... Oh, I know what it is to fear death!... I\n",
      "was lost twice on the ride--absolutely lost. That's all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo found her tongue. “The last thing was for you to fall wildly in love,\n",
      "wasn't it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“According to Dale, I must add that to my new experiences of\n",
      "to-day--before I can know real life,” replied Helen, demurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter turned away. “Let us go,” he said, soberly.\n",

      "\n",
      "After more days of riding the grassy level of that wonderfully gold\n",
      "and purple park, and dreamily listening by day to the ever-low and\n",
      "ever-changing murmur of the waterfall, and by night to the wild, lonely\n",
      "mourn of a hunting wolf, and climbing to the dizzy heights where the\n",
      "wind stung sweetly, Helen Rayner lost track of time and forgot her\n",
      "peril.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Beeman did not return. If occasionally Dale mentioned Roy and his\n",
      "quest, the girls had little to say beyond a recurrent anxiety for the\n",
      "old uncle, and then they forgot again. Paradise Park, lived in a little\n",
      "while at that season of the year, would have claimed any one, and ever\n",
      "afterward haunted sleeping or waking dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo gave up to the wild life, to the horses and rides, to the many pets,\n",
      "and especially to the cougar, Tom. The big cat followed her everywhere,\n",
      "played with her, rolling and pawing, kitten-like, and he would lay\n",
      "his massive head in her lap to purr his content. Bo had little fear of\n",
      "anything, and here in the wilds she soon lost that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another of Dale's pets was a half-grown black bear named Muss. He was\n",
      "abnormally jealous of little Bud and he had a well-developed hatred\n",
      "of Tom, otherwise he was a very good-tempered bear, and enjoyed Dale's\n",
      "impartial regard. Tom, however, chased Muss out of camp whenever Dale's\n",
      "back was turned, and sometimes Muss stayed away, shifting for himself.\n",
      "With the advent of Bo, who spent a good deal of time on the animals,\n",
      "Muss manifestly found the camp more attractive. Whereupon, Dale\n",
      "predicted trouble between Tom and Muss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo liked nothing better than a rough-and-tumble frolic with the black\n",
      "bear. Muss was not very big nor very heavy, and in a wrestling bout with\n",
      "the strong and wiry girl he sometimes came out second best. It spoke\n",
      "well of him that he seemed to be careful not to hurt Bo. He never bit\n",
      "or scratched, though he sometimes gave her sounding slaps with his paws.\n",
      "Whereupon, Bo would clench her gauntleted fists and sail into him in\n",
      "earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon before the early supper they always had, Dale and Helen\n",
      "were watching Bo teasing the bear. She was in her most vixenish mood,\n",
      "full of life and fight. Tom lay his long length on the grass, watching\n",
      "with narrow, gleaming eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bo and Muss locked in an embrace and went down to roll over and\n",
      "over, Dale called Helen's attention to the cougar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom's jealous. It's strange how animals are like people. Pretty soon\n",
      "I'll have to corral Muss, or there'll be a fight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not see anything wrong with Tom except that he did not look\n",
      "playful.\n",
      "\n",
      "During supper-time both bear and cougar disappeared, though this was not\n",
      "remarked until afterward. Dale whistled and called, but the rival pets\n",
      "did not return. Next morning Tom was there, curled up snugly at the foot\n",
      "of Bo's bed, and when she arose he followed her around as usual. But\n",
      "Muss did not return.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstance made Dale anxious. He left camp, taking Tom with him,\n",
      "and upon returning stated that he had followed Muss's track as far as\n",
      "possible, and then had tried to put Tom on the trail, but the cougar\n",
      "would not or could not follow it. Dale said Tom never liked a bear\n",
      "trail, anyway, cougars and bears being common enemies. So, whether by\n",
      "accident or design, Bo lost one of her playmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter searched some of the slopes next day and even went up on one\n",
      "of the mountains. He did not discover any sign of Muss, but he said he\n",
      "had found something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo you girls want some more real excitement?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen smiled her acquiescence and Bo replied with one of her forceful\n",
      "speeches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't mind bein' good an' scared?” he went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can't scare me,” bantered Bo. But Helen looked doubtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up in one of the parks I ran across one of my horses--a lame bay you\n",
      "haven't seen. Well, he had been killed by that old silvertip. The one we\n",
      "chased. Hadn't been dead over an hour. Blood was still runnin' an' only\n",
      "a little meat eaten. That bear heard me or saw me an' made off into the\n",
      "woods. But he'll come back to-night. I'm goin' up there, lay for him,\n",
      "an' kill him this time. Reckon you'd better go, because I don't want to\n",
      "leave you here alone at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going to take Tom?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. The bear might get his scent. An', besides, Tom ain't reliable on\n",

      "\n",
      "When they had hurried supper, and Dale had gotten in the horses, the sun\n",
      "had set and the valley was shadowing low down, while the ramparts were\n",
      "still golden. The long zigzag trail Dale followed up the slope took\n",
      "nearly an hour to climb, so that when that was surmounted and he led\n",
      "out of the woods twilight had fallen. A rolling park extended as far as\n",
      "Helen could see, bordered by forest that in places sent out straggling\n",
      "stretches of trees. Here and there, like islands, were isolated patches\n",
      "of timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "At ten thousand feet elevation the twilight of this clear and cold night\n",
      "was a rich and rare atmospheric effect. It looked as if it was seen\n",
      "through perfectly clear smoked glass. Objects were singularly visible,\n",
      "even at long range, and seemed magnified. In the west, where the\n",
      "afterglow of sunset lingered over the dark, ragged, spruce-speared\n",
      "horizon-line, there was such a transparent golden line melting into\n",
      "vivid star-fired blue that Helen could only gaze and gaze in wondering\n",
      "admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale spurred his horse into a lope and the spirited mounts of the girls\n",
      "kept up with him. The ground was rough, with tufts of grass growing\n",
      "close together, yet the horses did not stumble. Their action and\n",
      "snorting betrayed excitement. Dale led around several clumps of timber,\n",
      "up a long grassy swale, and then straight westward across an open flat\n",
      "toward where the dark-fringed forest-line raised itself wild and clear\n",
      "against the cold sky. The horses went swiftly, and the wind cut like a\n",
      "blade of ice. Helen could barely get her breath and she panted as if she\n",
      "had just climbed a laborsome hill. The stars began to blink out of the\n",
      "blue, and the gold paled somewhat, and yet twilight lingered. It seemed\n",
      "long across that flat, but really was short. Coming to a thin line of\n",
      "trees that led down over a slope to a deeper but still isolated patch\n",
      "of woods, Dale dismounted and tied his horse. When the girls got off he\n",
      "haltered their horses also.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stick close to me an' put your feet down easy,” he whispered. How tall\n",
      "and dark he loomed in the fading light! Helen thrilled, as she had often\n",
      "of late, at the strange, potential force of the man. Stepping softly,\n",
      "without the least sound, Dale entered this straggly bit of woods, which\n",
      "appeared to have narrow byways and nooks. Then presently he came to\n",
      "the top of a well-wooded slope, dark as pitch, apparently. But as Helen\n",
      "followed she perceived the trees, and they were thin dwarf spruce,\n",
      "partly dead. The slope was soft and springy, easy to step upon without\n",
      "noise. Dale went so cautiously that Helen could not hear him, and\n",
      "sometimes in the gloom she could not see him. Then the chill thrills ran\n",
      "over her. Bo kept holding on to Helen, which fact hampered Helen as\n",
      "well as worked somewhat to disprove Bo's boast. At last level ground was\n",
      "reached. Helen made out a light-gray background crossed by black bars.\n",
      "Another glance showed this to be the dark tree-trunks against the open\n",
      "park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale halted, and with a touch brought Helen to a straining pause. He was\n",
      "listening. It seemed wonderful to watch him bend his head and stand as\n",
      "silent and motionless as one of the dark trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's not there yet,” Dale whispered, and he stepped forward very\n",
      "slowly. Helen and Bo began to come up against thin dead branches that\n",
      "were invisible and then cracked. Then Dale knelt down, seemed to melt\n",
      "into the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll have to crawl,” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "How strange and thrilling that was for Helen, and hard work! The ground\n",
      "bore twigs and dead branches, which had to be carefully crawled over;\n",
      "and lying flat, as was necessary, it took prodigious effort to drag her\n",
      "body inch by inch. Like a huge snake, Dale wormed his way along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradually the wood lightened. They were nearing the edge of the park.\n",
      "Helen now saw a strip of open with a high, black wall of spruce beyond.\n",
      "The afterglow flashed or changed, like a dimming northern light, and\n",
      "then failed. Dale crawled on farther to halt at length between two\n",
      "tree-trunks at the edge of the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come up beside me,” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen crawled on, and presently Bo was beside her panting, with pale\n",
      "face and great, staring eyes, plain to be seen in the wan light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Moon's comin' up. We're just in time. The old grizzly's not there yet,\n",
      "but I see coyotes. Look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale pointed across the open neck of park to a dim blurred patch\n",
      "standing apart some little distance from the black wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's the dead horse,” whispered Dale. “An' if you watch close you can\n",
      "see the coyotes. They're gray an' they move.... Can't you hear them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's excited ears, so full of throbs and imaginings, presently\n",
      "registered low snaps and snarls. Bo gave her arm a squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hear them. They're fighting. Oh, gee!” she panted, and drew a long,\n",
      "full breath of unutterable excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep quiet now an' watch an' listen,” said the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly the black, ragged forest-line seemed to grow blacker and lift;\n",
      "slowly the gray neck of park lightened under some invisible influence;\n",
      "slowly the stars paled and the sky filled over. Somewhere the moon was\n",
      "rising. And slowly that vague blurred patch grew a little clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the tips of the spruce, now seen to be rather close at hand,\n",
      "shone a slender, silver crescent moon, darkening, hiding, shining again,\n",
      "climbing until its exquisite sickle-point topped the trees, and then,\n",
      "magically, it cleared them, radiant and cold. While the eastern black\n",
      "wall shaded still blacker, the park blanched and the border-line\n",
      "opposite began to stand out as trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! Look!” cried Bo, very low and fearfully, as she pointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so loud,” whispered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I see something!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep quiet,” he admonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen, in the direction Bo pointed, could not see anything but\n",
      "moon-blanched bare ground, rising close at hand to a little ridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lie still,” whispered Dale. “I'm goin' to crawl around to get a look\n",
      "from another angle. I'll be right back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved noiselessly backward and disappeared. With him gone, Helen felt\n",
      "a palpitating of her heart and a prickling of her skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my! Nell! Look!” whispered Bo, in fright. “I know I saw something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the little ridge a round object moved slowly, getting farther\n",
      "out into the light. Helen watched with suspended breath. It moved out\n",
      "to be silhouetted against the sky--apparently a huge, round, bristling\n",
      "animal, frosty in color. One instant it seemed huge--the next\n",
      "small--then close at hand--and far away. It swerved to come directly\n",
      "toward them. Suddenly Helen realized that the beast was not a dozen\n",
      "yards distant. She was just beginning a new experience--a real\n",
      "and horrifying terror in which her blood curdled, her heart gave a\n",
      "tremendous leap and then stood still, and she wanted to fly, but was\n",
      "rooted to the spot--when Dale returned to her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's a pesky porcupine,” he whispered. “Almost crawled over you. He\n",
      "sure would have stuck you full of quills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon he threw a stick at the animal. It bounced straight up to turn\n",
      "round with startling quickness, and it gave forth a rattling sound; then\n",
      "it crawled out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Por--cu--pine!” whispered Bo, pantingly. “It might--as well--have\n",
      "been--an elephant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen uttered a long, eloquent sigh. She would not have cared to\n",
      "describe her emotions at sight of a harmless hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen!” warned Dale, very low. His big hand closed over Helen's\n",
      "gauntleted one. “There you have--the real cry of the wild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharp and cold on the night air split the cry of a wolf, distant, yet\n",
      "wonderfully distinct. How wild and mournful and hungry! How marvelously\n",
      "pure! Helen shuddered through all her frame with the thrill of its\n",
      "music, the wild and unutterable and deep emotions it aroused. Again\n",
      "a sound of this forest had pierced beyond her life, back into the dim\n",
      "remote past from which she had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cry was not repeated. The coyotes were still. And silence fell,\n",
      "absolutely unbroken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale nudged Helen, and then reached over to give Bo a tap. He was\n",
      "peering keenly ahead and his strained intensity could be felt. Helen\n",
      "looked with all her might and she saw the shadowy gray forms of the\n",
      "coyotes skulk away, out of the moonlight into the gloom of the woods,\n",
      "where they disappeared. Not only Dale's intensity, but the very silence,\n",
      "the wildness of the moment and place, seemed fraught with wonderful\n",
      "potency. Bo must have felt it, too, for she was trembling all over, and\n",
      "holding tightly to Helen, and breathing quick and fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” muttered Dale, under his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen caught the relief and certainty in his exclamation, and she\n",
      "divined, then, something of what the moment must have been to a hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her roving, alert glance was arrested by a looming gray shadow\n",
      "coming out of the forest. It moved, but surely that huge thing could not\n",
      "be a bear. It passed out of gloom into silver moonlight. Helen's heart\n",
      "bounded. For it was a great frosty-coated bear lumbering along toward\n",
      "the dead horse. Instinctively Helen's hand sought the arm of the hunter.\n",
      "It felt like iron under a rippling surface. The touch eased away the\n",
      "oppression over her lungs, the tightness of her throat. What must have\n",
      "been fear left her, and only a powerful excitement remained. A sharp\n",
      "expulsion of breath from Bo and a violent jerk of her frame were signs\n",
      "that she had sighted the grizzly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the moonlight he looked of immense size, and that wild park with\n",
      "the gloomy blackness of forest furnished a fit setting for him. Helen's\n",
      "quick mind, so taken up with emotion, still had a thought for the wonder\n",
      "and the meaning of that scene. She wanted the bear killed, yet that\n",
      "seemed a pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a wagging, rolling, slow walk which took several moments to reach\n",
      "his quarry. When at length he reached it he walked around with sniffs\n",
      "plainly heard and then a cross growl. Evidently he had discovered that\n",
      "his meal had been messed over. As a whole the big bear could be seen\n",
      "distinctly, but only in outline and color. The distance was perhaps two\n",
      "hundred yards. Then it looked as if he had begun to tug at the carcass.\n",
      "Indeed, he was dragging it, very slowly, but surely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at that!” whispered Dale. “If he ain't strong!... Reckon I'll have\n",
      "to stop him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The grizzly, however, stopped of his own accord, just outside of the\n",
      "shadow-line of the forest. Then he hunched in a big frosty heap over his\n",
      "prey and began to tear and rend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jess was a mighty good horse,” muttered Dale, grimly; “too good to make\n",
      "a meal for a hog silvertip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the hunter silently rose to a kneeling position, swinging the\n",
      "rifle in front of him. He glanced up into the low branches of the tree\n",
      "overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, there's no tellin' what a grizzly will do. If I yell, you climb\n",
      "up in this tree, an' do it quick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he leveled the rifle, resting his left elbow on his knee. The\n",
      "front end of the rifle, reaching out of the shade, shone silver in the\n",
      "moonlight. Man and weapon became still as stone. Helen held her breath.\n",
      "But Dale relaxed, lowering the barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can't see the sights very well,” he whispered, shaking his head.\n",
      "“Remember, now--if I yell you climb!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he aimed and slowly grew rigid. Helen could not take her\n",
      "fascinated eyes off him. He knelt, bareheaded, and in the shadow she\n",
      "could make out the gleam of his clear-cut profile, stern and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "A streak of fire and a heavy report startled her. Then she heard the\n",
      "bullet hit. Shifting her glance, she saw the bear lurch with convulsive\n",
      "action, rearing on his hind legs. Loud clicking snaps must have been a\n",
      "clashing of his jaws in rage. But there was no other sound. Then again\n",
      "Dale's heavy gun boomed. Helen heard again that singular spatting thud\n",
      "of striking lead. The bear went down with a flop as if he had been dealt\n",
      "a terrific blow. But just as quickly he was up on all-fours and began\n",
      "to whirl with hoarse, savage bawls of agony and fury. His action quickly\n",
      "carried him out of the moonlight into the shadow, where he disappeared.\n",
      "There the bawls gave place to gnashing snarls, and crashings in the\n",
      "brush, and snapping of branches, as he made his way into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure he's mad,” said Dale, rising to his feet. “An' I reckon hard hit.\n",
      "But I won't follow him to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the girls got up, and Helen found she was shaky on her feet and\n",
      "very cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh-h, wasn't--it--won-wonder-ful!” cried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you scared? Your teeth are chatterin',” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm--cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it sure is cold, all right,” he responded. “Now the fun's over,\n",
      "you'll feel it.... Nell, you're froze, too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen nodded. She was, indeed, as cold as she had ever been before. But\n",
      "that did not prevent a strange warmness along her veins and a quickened\n",
      "pulse, the cause of which she did not conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's rustle,” said Dale, and led the way out of the wood and skirted\n",
      "its edge around to the slope. There they climbed to the flat, and went\n",
      "through the straggling line of trees to where the horses were tethered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up here the wind began to blow, not hard through the forest, but still\n",
      "strong and steady out in the open, and bitterly cold. Dale helped Bo to\n",
      "mount, and then Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm--numb,” she said. “I'll fall off--sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. You'll be warm in a jiffy,” he replied, “because we'll ride some\n",
      "goin' back. Let Ranger pick the way an' you hang on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With Ranger's first jump Helen's blood began to run. Out he shot, his\n",
      "lean, dark head beside Dale's horse. The wild park lay clear and bright\n",
      "in the moonlight, with strange, silvery radiance on the grass. The\n",
      "patches of timber, like spired black islands in a moon-blanched lake,\n",
      "seemed to harbor shadows, and places for bears to hide, ready to spring\n",
      "out. As Helen neared each little grove her pulses shook and her heart\n",
      "beat. Half a mile of rapid riding burned out the cold. And all seemed\n",
      "glorious--the sailing moon, white in a dark-blue sky, the white,\n",
      "passionless stars, so solemn, so far away, the beckoning fringe of\n",
      "forest-land at once mysterious and friendly, and the fleet horses,\n",
      "running with soft, rhythmic thuds over the grass, leaping the ditches\n",
      "and the hollows, making the bitter wind sting and cut. Coming up\n",
      "that park the ride had been long; going back was as short as it was\n",
      "thrilling. In Helen, experiences gathered realization slowly, and it\n",
      "was this swift ride, the horses neck and neck, and all the wildness and\n",
      "beauty, that completed the slow, insidious work of years. The tears\n",
      "of excitement froze on her cheeks and her heart heaved full. All that\n",
      "pertained to this night got into her blood. It was only to feel, to live\n",
      "now, but it could be understood and remembered forever afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's horse, a little in advance, sailed over a ditch. Ranger made a\n",
      "splendid leap, but he alighted among some grassy tufts and fell. Helen\n",
      "shot over his head. She struck lengthwise, her arms stretched, and slid\n",
      "hard to a shocking impact that stunned her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's scream rang in her ears; she felt the wet grass under her face and\n",
      "then the strong hands that lifted her. Dale loomed over her, bending\n",
      "down to look into her face; Bo was clutching her with frantic hands. And\n",
      "Helen could only gasp. Her breast seemed caved in. The need to breathe\n",
      "was torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!--you're not hurt. You fell light, like a feather. All grass\n",
      "here.... You can't be hurt!” said Dale, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "His anxious voice penetrated beyond her hearing, and his strong hands\n",
      "went swiftly over her arms and shoulders, feeling for broken bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just had the wind knocked out of you,” went on Dale. “It feels awful,\n",
      "but it's nothin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen got a little air, that was like hot pin-points in her lungs, and\n",
      "then a deeper breath, and then full, gasping respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I guess--I'm not hurt--not a bit,” she choked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You sure had a header. Never saw a prettier spill. Ranger doesn't do\n",
      "that often. I reckon we were travelin' too fast. But it was fun, don't\n",
      "you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Bo who answered. “Oh, glorious!... But, gee! I was scared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale still held Helen's hands. She released them while looking up at\n",
      "him. The moment was realization for her of what for days had been a\n",
      "vague, sweet uncertainty, becoming near and strange, disturbing and\n",
      "present. This accident had been a sudden, violent end to the wonderful\n",
      "ride. But its effect, the knowledge of what had got into her blood,\n",
      "would never change. And inseparable from it was this man of the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "\n",
      "On the next morning Helen was awakened by what she imagined had been a\n",
      "dream of some one shouting. With a start she sat up. The sunshine showed\n",
      "pink and gold on the ragged spruce line of the mountain rims. Bo was on\n",
      "her knees, braiding her hair with shaking hands, and at the same time\n",
      "trying to peep out.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the echoes of a ringing cry were cracking back from the cliffs. That\n",
      "had been Dale's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! Nell! Wake up!” called Bo, wildly. “Oh, some one's come! Horses\n",
      "and men!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen got to her knees and peered out over Bo's shoulder. Dale, standing\n",
      "tall and striking beside the campfire, was waving his sombrero. Away\n",
      "down the open edge of the park came a string of pack-burros with mounted\n",
      "men behind. In the foremost rider Helen recognized Roy Beeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That first one's Roy!” she exclaimed. “I'd never forget him on a\n",
      "horse.... Bo, it must mean Uncle Al's come!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure! We're born lucky. Here we are safe and sound--and all this grand\n",
      "camp trip.... Look at the cowboys.... LOOK! Oh, maybe this isn't great!”\n",
      " babbled Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale wheeled to see the girls peeping out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's time you're up!” he called. “Your uncle Al is here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant after Helen sank back out of Dale's sight she sat there\n",
      "perfectly motionless, so struck was she by the singular tone of Dale's\n",
      "voice. She imagined that he regretted what this visiting cavalcade of\n",
      "horsemen meant--they had come to take her to her ranch in Pine. Helen's\n",
      "heart suddenly began to beat fast, but thickly, as if muffled within her\n",
      "breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hurry now, girls,” called Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was already out, kneeling on the flat stone at the little brook,\n",
      "splashing water in a great hurry. Helen's hands trembled so that she\n",
      "could scarcely lace her boots or brush her hair, and she was long behind\n",
      "Bo in making herself presentable. When Helen stepped out, a short,\n",
      "powerfully built man in coarse garb and heavy boots stood holding Bo's\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, wal! You favor the Rayners,” he was saying, “I remember your dad,\n",
      "an' a fine feller he was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside them stood Dale and Roy, and beyond was a group of horses and\n",
      "riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle, here comes Nell,” said Bo, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” The old cattle-man breathed hard as he turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen hurried. She had not expected to remember this uncle, but one look\n",
      "into the brown, beaming face, with the blue eyes flashing, yet sad, and\n",
      "she recognized him, at the same instant recalling her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "He held out his arms to receive her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell Auchincloss all over again!” he exclaimed, in deep voice, as he\n",
      "kissed her. “I'd have knowed you anywhere!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al!” murmured Helen. “I remember you--though I was only four.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, wal,--that's fine,” he replied. “I remember you straddled my knee\n",
      "once, an' your hair was brighter--an' curly. It ain't neither now....\n",
      "Sixteen years! An' you're twenty now? What a fine, broad-shouldered girl\n",
      "you are! An', Nell, you're the handsomest Auchincloss I ever seen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen found herself blushing, and withdrew her hands from his as Roy\n",
      "stepped forward to pay his respects. He stood bareheaded, lean and tall,\n",
      "with neither his clear eyes nor his still face, nor the proffered hand\n",
      "expressing anything of the proven quality of fidelity, of achievement,\n",
      "that Helen sensed in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Miss Helen? Howdy, Bo?” he said. “You all both look fine an'\n",
      "brown.... I reckon I was shore slow rustlin' your uncle Al up here. But\n",
      "I was figgerin' you'd like Milt's camp for a while.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We sure did,” replied Bo, archly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” breathed Auchincloss, heavily. “Lemme set down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew the girls to the rustic seat Dale had built for them under the\n",
      "big pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you must be tired! How--how are you?” asked Helen, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tired! Wal, if I am it's jest this here minit. When Joe Beeman rode\n",
      "in on me with thet news of you--wal, I jest fergot I was a worn-out old\n",
      "hoss. Haven't felt so good in years. Mebbe two such young an' pretty\n",
      "nieces will make a new man of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al, you look strong and well to me,” said Bo. “And young, too,\n",
      "and--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! Thet 'll do,” interrupted Al. “I see through you. What you'll\n",
      "do to Uncle Al will be aplenty.... Yes, girls, I'm feelin' fine. But\n",
      "strange--strange! Mebbe thet's my joy at seein' you safe--safe when I\n",
      "feared so thet damned greaser Beasley--”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Helen's grave gaze his face changed swiftly--and all the serried\n",
      "years of toil and battle and privation showed, with something that was\n",
      "not age, nor resignation, yet as tragic as both.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, never mind him--now,” he added, slowly, and the warmer light\n",
      "returned to his face. “Dale--come here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter stepped closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I owe you more 'n I can ever pay,” said Auchincloss, with an\n",
      "arm around each niece.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Al, you don't owe me anythin',” returned Dale, thoughtfully, as he\n",
      "looked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” grunted Al. “You hear him, girls.... Now listen, you wild\n",
      "hunter. An' you girls listen.... Milt, I never thought you much good,\n",
      "'cept for the wilds. But I reckon I'll have to swallow thet. I do.\n",
      "Comin' to me as you did--an' after bein' druv off--keepin' your council\n",
      "an' savin' my girls from thet hold-up, wal, it's the biggest deal any\n",
      "man ever did for me.... An' I'm ashamed of my hard feelin's, an' here's\n",
      "my hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks, Al,” replied Dale, with his fleeting smile, and he met the\n",
      "proffered hand. “Now, will you be makin' camp here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, no. I'll rest a little, an' you can pack the girls' outfit--then\n",
      "we'll go. Sure you're goin' with us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll call the girls to breakfast,” replied Dale, and he moved away\n",
      "without answering Auchincloss's query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen divined that Dale did not mean to go down to Pine with them, and\n",
      "the knowledge gave her a blank feeling of surprise. Had she expected him\n",
      "to go?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come here, Jeff,” called Al, to one of his men.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short, bow-legged horseman with dusty garb and sun-bleached face\n",
      "hobbled forth from the group. He was not young, but he had a boyish grin\n",
      "and bright little eyes. Awkwardly he doffed his slouch sombrero.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jeff, shake hands with my nieces,” said Al. “This 's Helen, an' your\n",
      "boss from now on. An' this 's Bo, fer short. Her name was Nancy, but\n",
      "when she lay a baby in her cradle I called her Bo-Peep, an' the name's\n",
      "stuck.... Girls, this here's my foreman, Jeff Mulvey, who's been with me\n",
      "twenty years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction caused embarrassment to all three principals,\n",
      "particularly to Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jeff, throw the packs an' saddles fer a rest,” was Al's order to his\n",
      "foreman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, reckon you'll have fun bossin' thet outfit,” chuckled Al. “None\n",
      "of 'em's got a wife. Lot of scalawags they are; no women would have\n",
      "them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle, I hope I'll never have to be their boss,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you're goin' to be, right off,” declared Al. “They ain't a bad\n",
      "lot, after all. An' I got a likely new man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he turned to Bo, and, after studying her pretty face,\n",
      "he asked, in apparently severe tone, “Did you send a cowboy named\n",
      "Carmichael to ask me for a job?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo looked quite startled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael! Why, Uncle, I never heard that name before,” replied Bo,\n",
      "bewilderedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Reckoned the young rascal was lyin',” said Auchincloss. “But I\n",
      "liked the fellar's looks an' so let him stay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the rancher turned to the group of lounging riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, come here,” he ordered, in a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen thrilled at sight of a tall, superbly built cowboy reluctantly\n",
      "detaching himself from the group. He had a red-bronze face, young like a\n",
      "boy's. Helen recognized it, and the flowing red scarf, and the swinging\n",
      "gun, and the slow, spur-clinking gait. No other than Bo's Las Vegas\n",
      "cowboy admirer!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen flashed a look at Bo, which look gave her a delicious,\n",
      "almost irresistible desire to laugh. That young lady also recognized the\n",
      "reluctant individual approaching with flushed and downcast face. Helen\n",
      "recorded her first experience of Bo's utter discomfiture. Bo turned\n",
      "white then red as a rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, my niece said she never heard of the name Carmichael,” declared\n",
      "Al, severely, as the cowboy halted before him. Helen knew her uncle had\n",
      "the repute of dealing hard with his men, but here she was reassured and\n",
      "pleased at the twinkle in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, boss, I can't help thet,” drawled the cowboy. “It's good old\n",
      "Texas stock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not appear shamefaced now, but just as cool, easy, clear-eyed,\n",
      "and lazy as the day Helen had liked his warm young face and intent gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Texas! You fellars from the Pan Handle are always hollerin' Texas.\n",
      "I never seen thet Texans had any one else beat--say from Missouri,”\n",
      " returned Al, testily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael maintained a discreet silence, and carefully avoided looking\n",
      "at the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, reckon we'll all call you Las Vegas, anyway,” continued the\n",
      "rancher. “Didn't you say my niece sent you to me for a job?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Carmichael's easy manner vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, boss, shore my memory's pore,” he said. “I only says--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't tell me thet. My memory's not p-o-r-e,” replied Al, mimicking\n",
      "the drawl. “What you said was thet my niece would speak a good word for\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Carmichael stole a timid glance at Bo, the result of which was\n",
      "to render him utterly crestfallen. Not improbably he had taken Bo's\n",
      "expression to mean something it did not, for Helen read it as a mingling\n",
      "of consternation and fright. Her eyes were big and blazing; a red spot\n",
      "was growing in each cheek as she gathered strength from his confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, didn't you?” demanded Al.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the glance the old rancher shot from the cowboy to the others of\n",
      "his employ it seemed to Helen that they were having fun at Carmichael's\n",
      "expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I did,” suddenly replied the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! All right, here's my niece. Now see thet she speaks the good\n",
      "word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael looked at Bo and Bo looked at him. Their glances were\n",
      "strange, wondering, and they grew shy. Bo dropped hers. The cowboy\n",
      "apparently forgot what had been demanded of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen put a hand on the old rancher's arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle, what happened was my fault,” she said. “The train stopped at Las\n",
      "Vegas. This young man saw us at the open window. He must have guessed we\n",
      "were lonely, homesick girls, getting lost in the West. For he spoke to\n",
      "us--nice and friendly. He knew of you. And he asked, in what I took\n",
      "for fun, if we thought you would give him a job. And I replied, just to\n",
      "tease Bo, that she would surely speak a good word for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! So thet's it,” replied Al, and he turned to Bo with merry\n",
      "eyes. “Wal, I kept this here Las Vegas Carmichael on his say-so. Come on\n",
      "with your good word, unless you want to see him lose his job.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo did not grasp her uncle's bantering, because she was seriously gazing\n",
      "at the cowboy. But she had grasped something.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He--he was the first person--out West--to speak kindly to us,” she\n",
      "said, facing her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet's a pretty good word, but it ain't enough,” responded Al.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subdued laughter came from the listening group. Carmichael shifted from\n",
      "side to side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He--he looks as if he might ride a horse well,” ventured Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Best hossman I ever seen,” agreed Al, heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And--and shoot?” added Bo, hopefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, he packs thet gun low, like Jim Wilson an' all them Texas\n",
      "gun-fighters. Reckon thet ain't no good word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then--I'll vouch for him,” said Bo, with finality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet settles it.” Auchincloss turned to the cowboy. “Las Vegas, you're\n",
      "a stranger to us. But you're welcome to a place in the outfit an' I hope\n",
      "you won't never disappoint us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss's tone, passing from jest to earnest, betrayed to Helen the\n",
      "old rancher's need of new and true men, and hinted of trying days to\n",
      "come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael stood before Bo, sombrero in hand, rolling it round and\n",
      "round, manifestly bursting with words he could not speak. And the girl\n",
      "looked very young and sweet with her flushed face and shining eyes.\n",
      "Helen saw in the moment more than that little by-play of confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss--Miss Rayner--I shore--am obliged,” he stammered, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're very welcome,” she replied, softly. “I--I got on the next\n",
      "train,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he said that Bo was looking straight at him, but she seemed not to\n",
      "have heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's your name?” suddenly she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard that. But didn't uncle call you Las Vegas?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. But it wasn't my fault. Thet cow-punchin' outfit saddled it on\n",
      "me, right off. They Don't know no better. Shore I jest won't answer to\n",
      "thet handle.... Now--Miss Bo--my real name is Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I simply could not call you--any name but Las Vegas,” replied Bo, very\n",
      "sweetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But--beggin' your pardon--I--I don't like thet,” blustered Carmichael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People often get called names--they don't like,” she said, with deep\n",
      "intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy blushed scarlet. Helen as well as he got Bo's inference to\n",
      "that last audacious epithet he had boldly called out as the train was\n",
      "leaving Las Vegas. She also sensed something of the disaster in store\n",
      "for Mr. Carmichael. Just then the embarrassed young man was saved by\n",
      "Dale's call to the girls to come to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "That meal, the last for Helen in Paradise Park, gave rise to a strange\n",
      "and inexplicable restraint. She had little to say. Bo was in the highest\n",
      "spirits, teasing the pets, joking with her uncle and Roy, and even\n",
      "poking fun at Dale. The hunter seemed somewhat somber. Roy was his usual\n",
      "dry, genial self. And Auchincloss, who sat near by, was an interested\n",
      "spectator. When Tom put in an appearance, lounging with his feline grace\n",
      "into the camp, as if he knew he was a privileged pet, the rancher could\n",
      "scarcely contain himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, it's thet damn cougar!” he ejaculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, that's Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He ought to be corralled or chained. I've no use for cougars,”\n",
      " protested Al.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom is as tame an' safe as a kitten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Wal, you tell thet to the girls if you like. But not me! I'm an\n",
      "old hoss, I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al, Tom sleeps curled up at the foot of my bed,” said Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw--what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Honest Injun,” she responded. “Well, isn't it so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen smilingly nodded her corroboration. Then Bo called Tom to her and\n",
      "made him lie with his head on his stretched paws, right beside her, and\n",
      "beg for bits to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal! I'd never have believed thet!” exclaimed Al, shaking his big head.\n",
      "“Dale, it's one on me. I've had them big cats foller me on the trails,\n",
      "through the woods, moonlight an' dark. An' I've heard 'em let out thet\n",
      "awful cry. They ain't any wild sound on earth thet can beat a cougar's.\n",
      "Does this Tom ever let out one of them wails?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes at night,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, excuse me. Hope you don't fetch the yaller rascal down to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What'll you do with this menagerie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale regarded the rancher attentively. “Reckon, Al, I'll take care of\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you're goin' down to my ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Al scratched his head and gazed perplexedly at the hunter. “Wal, ain't\n",
      "it customary to visit friends?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks, Al. Next time I ride down Pine way--in the spring,\n",
      "perhaps--I'll run over an' see how you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spring!” ejaculated Auchincloss. Then he shook his head sadly and a\n",
      "far-away look filmed his eyes. “Reckon you'd call some late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, you'll get well now. These, girls--now--they'll cure you. Reckon I\n",
      "never saw you look so good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss did not press his point farther at that time, but after the\n",
      "meal, when the other men came to see Dale's camp and pets, Helen's quick\n",
      "ears caught the renewal of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm askin' you--will you come?” Auchincloss said, low and eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I wouldn't fit in down there,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, talk sense. You can't go on forever huntin' bear an' tamin'\n",
      "cats,” protested the old rancher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” asked the hunter, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss stood up and, shaking himself as if to ward off his testy\n",
      "temper, he put a hand on Dale's arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One reason is you're needed in Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How? Who needs me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do. I'm playin' out fast. An' Beasley's my enemy. The ranch an' all I\n",
      "got will go to Nell. Thet ranch will have to be run by a man an' HELD\n",
      "by a man. Do you savvy? It's a big job. An' I'm offerin' to make you my\n",
      "foreman right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, you sort of take my breath,” replied Dale. “An' I'm sure grateful.\n",
      "But the fact is, even if I could handle the job, I--I don't believe I'd\n",
      "want to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make yourself want to, then. Thet 'd soon come. You'd get interested.\n",
      "This country will develop. I seen thet years ago. The government is\n",
      "goin' to chase the Apaches out of here. Soon homesteaders will be\n",
      "flockin' in. Big future, Dale. You want to get in now. An'--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Auchincloss hesitated, then spoke lower:\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' take your chance with the girl!... I'll be on your side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A slight vibrating start ran over Dale's stalwart form.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al--you're plumb dotty!” he exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dotty! Me? Dotty!” ejaculated Auchincloss. Then he swore. “In a minit\n",
      "I'll tell you what you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Al, that talk's so--so--like an old fool's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Huh! An' why so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because that--wonderful girl would never look at me,” Dale replied,\n",
      "simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen her lookin' already,” declared Al, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook his head as if arguing with the old rancher was hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind thet,” went on Al. “Mebbe I am a dotty old fool--'specially\n",
      "for takin' a shine to you. But I say again--will you come down to Pine\n",
      "and be my foreman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I've no son--an' I'm--afraid of Beasley.” This was uttered in an\n",
      "agitated whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, you make me ashamed,” said Dale, hoarsely. “I can't come. I've no\n",
      "nerve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You've no what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, I don't know what's wrong with me. But I'm afraid I'd find out if I\n",

      "\n",
      "“Aw yes, you will--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen rose with beating heart and tingling ears, and moved away out of\n",
      "hearing. She had listened too long to what had not been intended for her\n",
      "ears, yet she could not be sorry. She walked a few rods along the brook,\n",
      "out from under the pines, and, standing in the open edge of the park,\n",
      "she felt the beautiful scene still her agitation. The following\n",
      "moments, then, were the happiest she had spent in Paradise Park, and the\n",
      "profoundest of her whole life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently her uncle called her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, this here hunter wants to give you thet black hoss. An' I say you\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ranger deserves better care than I can give him,” said Dale. “He runs\n",

      "An' the hound, Pedro, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo swept a saucy glance from Dale to her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure she'll have Ranger. Just offer him to ME!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood there expectantly, holding a blanket in his hand, ready to\n",
      "saddle the horse. Carmichael walked around Ranger with that appraising\n",
      "eye so keen in cowboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, do you know anything about horses?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Ranger is mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale smoothed out the blanket and, folding it, he threw it over the\n",
      "horse; and then with one powerful swing he set the saddle in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you very much for him,” said Helen, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're welcome, an' I'm sure glad,” responded Dale, and then, after a\n",
      "few deft, strong pulls at the straps, he continued. “There, he's ready\n",
      "for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he laid an arm over the saddle, and faced Helen as she stood\n",
      "patting and smoothing Ranger. Helen, strong and calm now, in feminine\n",
      "possession of her secret and his, as well as her composure, looked\n",
      "frankly and steadily at Dale. He seemed composed, too, yet the bronze of\n",
      "his fine face was a trifle pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I can't thank you--I'll never be able to repay you--for your\n",
      "service to me and my sister,” said Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you needn't try,” Dale returned. “An' my service, as you call\n",
      "it, has been good for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going down to Pine with us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you will come soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not very soon, I reckon,” he replied, and averted his gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hardly before spring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spring?... That is a long time. Won't you come to see me sooner than\n",
      "that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I can get down to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're the first friend I've made in the West,” said Helen, earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll make many more--an' I reckon soon forget him you called the man\n",
      "of the forest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never forget any of my friends. And you've been the--the biggest\n",
      "friend I ever had.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be proud to remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But will you remember--will you promise to come to Pine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you. All's well, then.... My friend, goodby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-by,” he said, clasping her hand. His glance was clear, warm,\n",
      "beautiful, yet it was sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss's hearty voice broke the spell. Then Helen saw that the\n",
      "others were mounted. Bo had ridden up close; her face was earnest\n",
      "and happy and grieved all at once, as she bade good-by to Dale. The\n",
      "pack-burros were hobbling along toward the green slope. Helen was the\n",
      "last to mount, but Roy was the last to leave the hunter. Pedro came\n",
      "reluctantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a merry, singing train which climbed that brown odorous trail,\n",
      "under the dark spruces. Helen assuredly was happy, yet a pang abided in\n",
      "her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered that half-way up the slope there was a turn in the trail\n",
      "where it came out upon an open bluff. The time seemed long, but at last\n",
      "she got there. And she checked Ranger so as to have a moment's gaze down\n",
      "into the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "It yawned there, a dark-green and bright-gold gulf, asleep under a\n",
      "westering sun, exquisite, wild, lonesome. Then she saw Dale standing in\n",
      "the open space between the pines and the spruces. He waved to her. And\n",
      "she returned the salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy caught up with her then and halted his horse. He waved his sombrero\n",
      "to Dale and let out a piercing yell that awoke the sleeping echoes,\n",
      "splitting strangely from cliff to cliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore Milt never knowed what it was to be lonesome,” said Roy, as if\n",
      "thinking aloud. “But he'll know now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger stepped out of his own accord and, turning off the ledge, entered\n",
      "the spruce forest. Helen lost sight of Paradise Park. For hours then\n",
      "she rode along a shady, fragrant trail, seeing the beauty of color and\n",
      "wildness, hearing the murmur and rush and roar of water, but all the\n",
      "while her mind revolved the sweet and momentous realization which had\n",
      "thrilled her--that the hunter, this strange man of the forest, so deeply\n",
      "versed in nature and so unfamiliar with emotion, aloof and simple and\n",
      "strong like the elements which had developed him, had fallen in love\n",
      "with her and did not know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XV\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood with face and arm upraised, and he watched Helen ride off the\n",
      "ledge to disappear in the forest. That vast spruce slope seemed to have\n",
      "swallowed her. She was gone! Slowly Dale lowered his arm with gesture\n",
      "expressive of a strange finality, an eloquent despair, of which he was\n",
      "unconscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to the park, to his camp, and the many duties of a hunter. The\n",
      "park did not seem the same, nor his home, nor his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon this feelin's natural,” he soliloquized, resignedly, “but it's\n",
      "sure queer for me. That's what comes of makin' friends. Nell an' Bo,\n",
      "now, they made a difference, an' a difference I never knew before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He calculated that this difference had been simply one of\n",
      "responsibility, and then the charm and liveliness of the companionship\n",
      "of girls, and finally friendship. These would pass now that the causes\n",
      "were removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he had worked an hour around camp he realized a change had come,\n",
      "but it was not the one anticipated. Always before he had put his mind on\n",
      "his tasks, whatever they might be; now he worked while his thoughts were\n",
      "strangely involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little bear cub whined at his heels; the tame deer seemed to regard\n",
      "him with deep, questioning eyes, the big cougar padded softly here and\n",
      "there as if searching for something.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You all miss them--now--I reckon,” said Dale. “Well, they're gone an'\n",
      "you'll have to get along with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some vague approach to irritation with his pets surprised him. Presently\n",
      "he grew both irritated and surprised with himself--a state of mind\n",
      "totally unfamiliar. Several times, as old habit brought momentary\n",
      "abstraction, he found himself suddenly looking around for Helen and\n",
      "Bo. And each time the shock grew stronger. They were gone, but their\n",
      "presence lingered. After his camp chores were completed he went over to\n",
      "pull down the lean-to which the girls had utilized as a tent. The spruce\n",
      "boughs had dried out brown and sear; the wind had blown the roof awry;\n",
      "the sides were leaning in. As there was now no further use for\n",
      "this little habitation, he might better pull it down. Dale did not\n",
      "acknowledge that his gaze had involuntarily wandered toward it many\n",
      "times. Therefore he strode over with the intention of destroying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time since Roy and he had built the lean-to he stepped\n",
      "inside. Nothing was more certain than the fact that he experienced a\n",
      "strange sensation, perfectly incomprehensible to him. The blankets\n",
      "lay there on the spruce boughs, disarranged and thrown back by hurried\n",
      "hands, yet still holding something of round folds where the slender\n",
      "forms had nestled. A black scarf often worn by Bo lay covering the\n",
      "pillow of pine-needles; a red ribbon that Helen had worn on her hair\n",
      "hung from a twig. These articles were all that had been forgotten. Dale\n",
      "gazed at them attentively, then at the blankets, and all around the\n",
      "fragrant little shelter; and he stepped outside with an uncomfortable\n",
      "knowledge that he could not destroy the place where Helen and Bo had\n",
      "spent so many hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon, in studious mood, Dale took up his rifle and strode out to\n",
      "hunt. His winter supply of venison had not yet been laid in. Action\n",
      "suited his mood; he climbed far and passed by many a watching buck\n",
      "to slay which seemed murder; at last he jumped one that was wild and\n",
      "bounded away. This he shot, and set himself a Herculean task in packing\n",
      "the whole carcass back to camp. Burdened thus, he staggered under the\n",
      "trees, sweating freely, many times laboring for breath, aching with\n",
      "toil, until at last he had reached camp. There he slid the deer carcass\n",
      "off his shoulders, and, standing over it, he gazed down while his breast\n",
      "labored. It was one of the finest young bucks he had ever seen. But\n",
      "neither in stalking it, nor making a wonderful shot, nor in packing home\n",
      "a weight that would have burdened two men, nor in gazing down at his\n",
      "beautiful quarry, did Dale experience any of the old joy of the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm a little off my feed,” he mused, as he wiped sweat from his heated\n",
      "face. “Maybe a little dotty, as I called Al. But that'll pass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever his state, it did not pass. As of old, after a long day's hunt,\n",
      "he reclined beside the camp-fire and watched the golden sunset glows\n",
      "change on the ramparts; as of old he laid a hand on the soft, furry head\n",
      "of the pet cougar; as of old he watched the gold change to red and then\n",
      "to dark, and twilight fall like a blanket; as of old he listened to\n",
      "the dreamy, lulling murmur of the water fall. The old familiar beauty,\n",
      "wildness, silence, and loneliness were there, but the old content seemed\n",
      "strangely gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soberly he confessed then that he missed the happy company of the girls.\n",
      "He did not distinguish Helen from Bo in his slow introspection. When\n",
      "he sought his bed he did not at once fall to sleep. Always, after a\n",
      "few moments of wakefulness, while the silence settled down or the wind\n",
      "moaned through the pines, he had fallen asleep. This night he found\n",
      "different. Though he was tired, sleep would not soon come. The\n",
      "wilderness, the mountains, the park, the camp--all seemed to have lost\n",
      "something. Even the darkness seemed empty. And when at length Dale fell\n",
      "asleep it was to be troubled by restless dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up with the keen-edged, steely-bright dawn, he went at the his tasks\n",
      "with the springy stride of the deer-stalker.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of that strenuous day, which was singularly full of the old\n",
      "excitement and action and danger, and of new observations, he was bound\n",
      "to confess that no longer did the chase suffice for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many times on the heights that day, with the wind keen in his face, and\n",
      "the vast green billows of spruce below him, he had found that he was\n",
      "gazing without seeing, halting without object, dreaming as he had never\n",
      "dreamed before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, when a magnificent elk came out upon a rocky ridge and, whistling\n",
      "a challenge to invisible rivals, stood there a target to stir any\n",
      "hunter's pulse, Dale did not even raise his rifle. Into his ear just\n",
      "then rang Helen's voice: “Milt Dale, you are no Indian. Giving yourself\n",
      "to a hunter's wildlife is selfish. It is wrong. You love this lonely\n",
      "life, but it is not work. Work that does not help others is not a real\n",
      "man's work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment conscience tormented him. It was not what he loved,\n",
      "but what he ought to do, that counted in the sum of good achieved in the\n",
      "world. Old Al Auchincloss had been right. Dale was wasting strength and\n",
      "intelligence that should go to do his share in the development of the\n",
      "West. Now that he had reached maturity, if through his knowledge of\n",
      "nature's law he had come to see the meaning of the strife of men for\n",
      "existence, for place, for possession, and to hold them in contempt, that\n",
      "was no reason why he should keep himself aloof from them, from some work\n",
      "that was needed in an incomprehensible world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale did not hate work, but he loved freedom. To be alone, to live with\n",
      "nature, to feel the elements, to labor and dream and idle and climb\n",
      "and sleep unhampered by duty, by worry, by restriction, by the petty\n",
      "interests of men--this had always been his ideal of living. Cowboys,\n",
      "riders, sheep-herders, farmers--these toiled on from one place and\n",
      "one job to another for the little money doled out to them. Nothing\n",
      "beautiful, nothing significant had ever existed in that for him. He had\n",
      "worked as a boy at every kind of range-work, and of all that humdrum\n",
      "waste of effort he had liked sawing wood best. Once he had quit a job\n",
      "of branding cattle because the smell of burning hide, the bawl of the\n",
      "terrified calf, had sickened him. If men were honest there would be no\n",
      "need to scar cattle. He had never in the least desired to own land and\n",
      "droves of stock, and make deals with ranchmen, deals advantageous to\n",
      "himself. Why should a man want to make a deal or trade a horse or do a\n",
      "piece of work to another man's disadvantage? Self-preservation was the\n",
      "first law of life. But as the plants and trees and birds and beasts\n",
      "interpreted that law, merciless and inevitable as they were, they had\n",
      "neither greed nor dishonesty. They lived by the grand rule of what was\n",
      "best for the greatest number.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dale's philosophy, cold and clear and inevitable, like nature\n",
      "itself, began to be pierced by the human appeal in Helen Rayner's words.\n",
      "What did she mean? Not that he should lose his love of the wilderness,\n",
      "but that he realize himself! Many chance words of that girl had depth.\n",
      "He was young, strong, intelligent, free from taint of disease or the\n",
      "fever of drink. He could do something for others. Who? If that mattered,\n",
      "there, for instance, was poor old Mrs. Cass, aged and lame now; there\n",
      "was Al Auchincloss, dying in his boots, afraid of enemies, and wistful\n",
      "for his blood and his property to receive the fruit of his labors; there\n",
      "were the two girls, Helen and Bo, new and strange to the West, about to\n",
      "be confronted by a big problem of ranch life and rival interests. Dale\n",
      "thought of still more people in the little village of Pine--of others\n",
      "who had failed, whose lives were hard, who could have been made happier\n",
      "by kindness and assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, was the duty of Milt Dale to himself? Because men preyed on\n",
      "one another and on the weak, should he turn his back upon a so-called\n",
      "civilization or should he grow like them? Clear as a bell came the\n",
      "answer that his duty was to do neither. And then he saw how the little\n",
      "village of Pine, as well as the whole world, needed men like him. He had\n",
      "gone to nature, to the forest, to the wilderness for his development;\n",
      "and all the judgments and efforts of his future would be a result of\n",
      "that education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Dale, lying in the darkness and silence of his lonely park, arrived\n",
      "at a conclusion that he divined was but the beginning of a struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took long introspection to determine the exact nature of that\n",
      "struggle, but at length it evolved into the paradox that Helen Rayner\n",
      "had opened his eyes to his duty as a man, that he accepted it, yet found\n",
      "a strange obstacle in the perplexing, tumultuous, sweet fear of ever\n",
      "going near her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, then, all his thought revolved around the girl, and, thrown\n",
      "off his balance, he weltered in a wilderness of unfamiliar strange\n",
      "ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he awoke next day the fight was on in earnest. In his sleep his\n",
      "mind had been active. The idea that greeted him, beautiful as the\n",
      "sunrise, flashed in memory of Auchincloss's significant words, “Take\n",
      "your chance with the girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old rancher was in his dotage. He hinted of things beyond the range\n",
      "of possibility. That idea of a chance for Dale remained before his\n",
      "consciousness only an instant. Stars were unattainable; life could\n",
      "not be fathomed; the secret of nature did not abide alone on the\n",
      "earth--these theories were not any more impossible of proving than that\n",
      "Helen Rayner might be for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, her strange coming into his life had played havoc, the\n",
      "extent of which he had only begun to realize.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a month he tramped through the forest. It was October, a still\n",
      "golden, fulfilling season of the year; and everywhere in the vast dark\n",
      "green a glorious blaze of oak and aspen made beautiful contrast. He\n",
      "carried his rifle, but he never used it. He would climb miles and go\n",
      "this way and that with no object in view. Yet his eye and ear had\n",
      "never been keener. Hours he would spend on a promontory, watching\n",
      "the distance, where the golden patches of aspen shone bright out\n",
      "of dark-green mountain slopes. He loved to fling himself down in an\n",
      "aspen-grove at the edge of a senaca, and there lie in that radiance like\n",
      "a veil of gold and purple and red, with the white tree-trunks striping\n",
      "the shade. Always, whether there were breeze or not, the aspen-leaves\n",
      "quivered, ceaselessly, wonderfully, like his pulses, beyond his control.\n",
      "Often he reclined against a mossy rock beside a mountain stream to\n",
      "listen, to watch, to feel all that was there, while his mind held a\n",
      "haunting, dark-eyed vision of a girl. On the lonely heights, like an\n",
      "eagle, he sat gazing down into Paradise Park, that was more and more\n",
      "beautiful, but would never again be the same, never fill him with\n",
      "content, never be all and all to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in October the first snow fell. It melted at once on the south side\n",
      "of the park, but the north slopes and the rims and domes above stayed\n",
      "white.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had worked quick and hard at curing and storing his winter supply\n",
      "of food, and now he spent days chopping and splitting wood to burn\n",
      "during the months he would be snowed-in. He watched for the dark-gray,\n",
      "fast-scudding storm-clouds, and welcomed them when they came. Once there\n",
      "lay ten feet of snow on the trails he would be snowed-in until spring.\n",
      "It would be impossible to go down to Pine. And perhaps during the long\n",
      "winter he would be cured of this strange, nameless disorder of his\n",
      "feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "November brought storms up on the peaks. Flurries of snow fell in\n",
      "the park every day, but the sunny south side, where Dale's camp lay,\n",
      "retained its autumnal color and warmth. Not till late in winter did the\n",
      "snow creep over this secluded nook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning came at last, piercingly keen and bright, when Dale saw\n",
      "that the heights were impassable; the realization brought him a poignant\n",
      "regret. He had not guessed how he had wanted to see Helen Rayner again\n",
      "until it was too late. That opened his eyes. A raging frenzy of action\n",
      "followed, in which he only tired himself physically without helping\n",
      "himself spiritually.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was sunset when he faced the west, looking up at the pink snow-domes\n",
      "and the dark-golden fringe of spruce, and in that moment he found the\n",
      "truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love that girl! I love that girl!” he spoke aloud, to the distant\n",
      "white peaks, to the winds, to the loneliness and silence of his prison,\n",
      "to the great pines and to the murmuring stream, and to his faithful\n",
      "pets. It was his tragic confession of weakness, of amazing truth, of\n",
      "hopeless position, of pitiful excuse for the transformation wrought in\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's struggle ended there when he faced his soul. To understand\n",
      "himself was to be released from strain, worry, ceaseless importuning\n",
      "doubt and wonder and fear. But the fever of unrest, of uncertainty, had\n",
      "been nothing compared to a sudden upflashing torment of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "With somber deliberation he set about the tasks needful, and others\n",
      "that he might make--his camp-fires and meals, the care of his pets and\n",
      "horses, the mending of saddles and pack-harness, the curing of buckskin\n",
      "for moccasins and hunting-suits. So his days were not idle. But all this\n",
      "work was habit for him and needed no application of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Dale, like some men of lonely wilderness lives who did not\n",
      "retrograde toward the savage, was a thinker. Love made him a sufferer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surprise and shame of his unconscious surrender, the certain\n",
      "hopelessness of it, the long years of communion with all that was wild,\n",
      "lonely, and beautiful, the wonderfully developed insight into nature's\n",
      "secrets, and the sudden-dawning revelation that he was no omniscient\n",
      "being exempt from the ruthless ordinary destiny of man--all these showed\n",
      "him the strength of his manhood and of his passion, and that the life\n",
      "he had chosen was of all lives the one calculated to make love sad and\n",
      "terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Rayner haunted him. In the sunlight there was not a place\n",
      "around camp which did not picture her lithe, vigorous body, her dark,\n",
      "thoughtful eyes, her eloquent, resolute lips, and the smile that was so\n",
      "sweet and strong. At night she was there like a slender specter, pacing\n",
      "beside him under the moaning pines. Every camp-fire held in its heart\n",
      "the glowing white radiance of her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nature had taught Dale to love solitude and silence, but love itself\n",
      "taught him their meaning. Solitude had been created for the eagle on his\n",
      "crag, for the blasted mountain fir, lonely and gnarled on its peak, for\n",
      "the elk and the wolf. But it had not been intended for man. And to\n",
      "live always in the silence of wild places was to become obsessed with\n",
      "self--to think and dream--to be happy, which state, however pursued by\n",
      "man, was not good for him. Man must be given imperious longings for the\n",
      "unattainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It needed, then, only the memory of an unattainable woman to render\n",
      "solitude passionately desired by a man, yet almost unendurable. Dale was\n",
      "alone with his secret; and every pine, everything in that park saw him\n",
      "shaken and undone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dark, pitchy deadness of night, when there was no wind and the\n",
      "cold on the peaks had frozen the waterfall, then the silence seemed\n",
      "insupportable. Many hours that should have been given to slumber were\n",
      "paced out under the cold, white, pitiless stars, under the lonely pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's memory betrayed him, mocked his restraint, cheated him of\n",
      "any peace; and his imagination, sharpened by love, created pictures,\n",
      "fancies, feelings, that drove him frantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of Helen Rayner's strong, shapely brown hand. In a thousand\n",
      "different actions it haunted him. How quick and deft in camp-fire tasks!\n",
      "how graceful and swift as she plaited her dark hair! how tender and\n",
      "skilful in its ministration when one of his pets had been injured! how\n",
      "eloquent when pressed tight against her breast in a moment of fear on\n",
      "the dangerous heights! how expressive of unutterable things when laid on\n",
      "his arm!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale saw that beautiful hand slowly creep up his arm, across his\n",
      "shoulder, and slide round his neck to clasp there. He was powerless to\n",
      "inhibit the picture. And what he felt then was boundless, unutterable.\n",
      "No woman had ever yet so much as clasped his hand, and heretofore no\n",
      "such imaginings had ever crossed his mind, yet deep in him, somewhere\n",
      "hidden, had been this waiting, sweet, and imperious need. In the bright\n",
      "day he appeared to ward off such fancies, but at night he was helpless.\n",
      "And every fancy left him weaker, wilder.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, at the culmination of this phase of his passion, Dale, who\n",
      "had never known the touch of a woman's lips, suddenly yielded to the\n",
      "illusion of Helen Rayner's kisses, he found himself quite mad, filled\n",
      "with rapture and despair, loving her as he hated himself. It seemed as\n",
      "if he had experienced all these terrible feelings in some former life\n",
      "and had forgotten them in this life. He had no right to think of her,\n",
      "but he could not resist it. Imagining the sweet surrender of her lips\n",
      "was a sacrilege, yet here, in spite of will and honor and shame, he was\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, at length, was vanquished, and he ceased to rail at himself, or\n",
      "restrain his fancies. He became a dreamy, sad-eyed, camp-fire gazer,\n",
      "like many another lonely man, separated, by chance or error, from what\n",
      "the heart hungered most for. But this great experience, when all its\n",
      "significance had clarified in his mind, immeasurably broadened his\n",
      "understanding of the principles of nature applied to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love had been in him stronger than in most men, because of his keen,\n",
      "vigorous, lonely years in the forest, where health of mind and body were\n",
      "intensified and preserved. How simple, how natural, how inevitable! He\n",
      "might have loved any fine-spirited, healthy-bodied girl. Like a tree\n",
      "shooting its branches and leaves, its whole entity, toward the sunlight,\n",
      "so had he grown toward a woman's love. Why? Because the thing he revered\n",
      "in nature, the spirit, the universal, the life that was God, had created\n",
      "at his birth or before his birth the three tremendous instincts of\n",
      "nature--to fight for life, to feed himself, to reproduce his kind. That\n",
      "was all there was to it. But oh! the mystery, the beauty, the torment,\n",
      "and the terror of this third instinct--this hunger for the sweetness and\n",
      "the glory of a woman's love!\n",

      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Rayner dropped her knitting into her lap and sat pensively gazing\n",
      "out of the window over the bare yellow ranges of her uncle's ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The winter day was bright, but steely, and the wind that whipped down\n",
      "from the white-capped mountains had a keen, frosty edge. A scant snow\n",
      "lay in protected places; cattle stood bunched in the lee of ridges; low\n",
      "sheets of dust scurried across the flats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big living-room of the ranch-house was warm and comfortable with its\n",
      "red adobe walls, its huge stone fireplace where cedar logs blazed, and\n",
      "its many-colored blankets. Bo Rayner sat before the fire, curled up in\n",
      "an armchair, absorbed in a book. On the floor lay the hound Pedro, his\n",
      "racy, fine head stretched toward the warmth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did uncle call?” asked Helen, with a start out of her reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn't hear him,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen rose to tiptoe across the floor, and, softly parting some\n",
      "curtains, she looked into the room where her uncle lay. He was asleep.\n",
      "Sometimes he called out in his slumbers. For weeks now he had been\n",
      "confined to his bed, slowly growing weaker. With a sigh Helen returned\n",
      "to her window-seat and took up her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, the sun is bright,” she said. “The days are growing longer. I'm so\n",
      "glad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, you're always wishing time away. For me it passes quickly\n",
      "enough,” replied the sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I love spring and summer and fall--and I guess I hate winter,”\n",
      " returned Helen, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellow ranges rolled away up to the black ridges and they in turn\n",
      "swept up to the cold, white mountains. Helen's gaze seemed to go beyond\n",
      "that snowy barrier. And Bo's keen eyes studied her sister's earnest, sad\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, do you ever think of Dale?” she queried, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question startled Helen. A slow blush suffused neck and cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” she replied, as if surprised that Bo should ask such a\n",
      "thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I shouldn't have asked that,” said Bo, softly, and then bent again\n",
      "over her book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed tenderly at that bright, bowed head. In this swift-flying,\n",
      "eventful, busy winter, during which the management of the ranch had\n",
      "devolved wholly upon Helen, the little sister had grown away from her.\n",
      "Bo had insisted upon her own free will and she had followed it, to\n",
      "the amusement of her uncle, to the concern of Helen, to the dismay and\n",
      "bewilderment of the faithful Mexican housekeeper, and to the undoing of\n",
      "all the young men on the ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had always been hoping and waiting for a favorable hour in which\n",
      "she might find this wilful sister once more susceptible to wise and\n",
      "loving influence. But while she hesitated to speak, slow footsteps and a\n",
      "jingle of spurs sounded without, and then came a timid knock. Bo looked\n",
      "up brightly and ran to open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! It's only--YOU!” she uttered, in withering scorn, to the one who\n",
      "knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen thought she could guess who that was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you-all?” asked a drawling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Mister Carmichael, if that interests you--I'm quite ill,” replied\n",
      "Bo, freezingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ill! Aw no, now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a fact. If I don't die right off I'll have to be taken back to\n",
      "Missouri,” said Bo, casually.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you goin' to ask me in?” queried Carmichael, bluntly. “It's\n",
      "cold--an' I've got somethin' to say to--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To ME? Well, you're not backward, I declare,” retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Rayner, I reckon it 'll be strange to you--findin' out I didn't\n",
      "come to see you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed! No. But what was strange was the deluded idea I had--that you\n",
      "meant to apologize to me--like a gentleman.... Come in, Mr. Carmichael.\n",
      "My sister is here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The door closed as Helen turned round. Carmichael stood just inside with\n",
      "his sombrero in hand, and as he gazed at Bo his lean face seemed hard.\n",
      "In the few months since autumn he had changed--aged, it seemed, and the\n",
      "once young, frank, alert, and careless cowboy traits had merged into the\n",
      "making of a man. Helen knew just how much of a man he really was. He had\n",
      "been her mainstay during all the complex working of the ranch that had\n",
      "fallen upon her shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckon you was deluded, all right--if you thought I'd crawl like\n",
      "them other lovers of yours,” he said, with cool deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo turned pale, and her eyes fairly blazed, yet even in what must have\n",
      "been her fury Helen saw amaze and pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“OTHER lovers? I think the biggest delusion here is the way you flatter\n",
      "yourself,” replied Bo, stingingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me flatter myself? Nope. You don't savvy me. I'm shore hatin' myself\n",
      "these days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Small wonder. I certainly hate you--with all my heart!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this retort the cowboy dropped his head and did not see Bo flaunt\n",
      "herself out of the room. But he heard the door close, and then slowly\n",
      "came toward Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cheer up, Las Vegas,” said Helen, smiling. “Bo's hot-tempered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, I'm just like a dog. The meaner she treats me the more I\n",
      "love her,” he replied, dejectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen's first instinct of liking for this cowboy there had been added\n",
      "admiration, respect, and a growing appreciation of strong, faithful,\n",
      "developing character. Carmichael's face and hands were red and chapped\n",
      "from winter winds; the leather of wrist-bands, belt, and boots was all\n",
      "worn shiny and thin; little streaks of dust fell from him as he breathed\n",
      "heavily. He no longer looked the dashing cowboy, ready for a dance or\n",
      "lark or fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How in the world did you offend her so?” asked Helen. “Bo is furious. I\n",
      "never saw her so angry as that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, it was jest this way,” began Carmichael. “Shore Bo's knowed\n",
      "I was in love with her. I asked her to marry me an' she wouldn't say\n",
      "yes or no.... An', mean as it sounds--she never run away from it, thet's\n",
      "shore. We've had some quarrels--two of them bad, an' this last's the\n",
      "worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo told me about one quarrel,” said Helen. “It was--because you\n",
      "drank--that time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it was. She took one of her cold spells an' I jest got drunk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that was wrong,” protested Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ain't so shore. You see, I used to get drunk often--before I come\n",
      "here. An' I've been drunk only once. Back at Las Vegas the outfit would\n",
      "never believe thet. Wal, I promised Bo I wouldn't do it again, an' I've\n",
      "kept my word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is fine of you. But tell me, why is she angry now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo makes up to all the fellars,” confessed Carmichael, hanging his\n",
      "head. “I took her to the dance last week--over in the town-hall. Thet's\n",
      "the first time she'd gone anywhere with me. I shore was proud.... But\n",
      "thet dance was hell. Bo carried on somethin' turrible, an' I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me. What did she do?” demanded Helen, anxiously. “I'm responsible\n",
      "for her. I've got to see that she behaves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, I ain't sayin' she didn't behave like a lady,” replied Carmichael.\n",
      "“It was--she--wal, all them fellars are fools over her--an' Bo wasn't\n",
      "true to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear boy, is Bo engaged to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord--if she only was!” he sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then how can you say she wasn't true to you? Be reasonable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon now, Miss Nell, thet no one can be in love an' act\n",
      "reasonable,” rejoined the cowboy. “I don't know how to explain, but the\n",
      "fact is I feel thet Bo has played the--the devil with me an' all the\n",
      "other fellars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean she has flirted?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I'm afraid you're right,” said Helen, with growing\n",
      "apprehension. “Go on. Tell me what's happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet Turner boy, who rides for Beasley, he was hot after Bo,”\n",
      " returned Carmichael, and he spoke as if memory hurt him. “Reckon I've\n",
      "no use for Turner. He's a fine-lookin', strappin', big cow-puncher, an'\n",
      "calculated to win the girls. He brags thet he can, an' I reckon he's\n",
      "right. Wal, he was always hangin' round Bo. An' he stole one of my\n",
      "dances with Bo. I only had three, an' he comes up to say this one was\n",
      "his; Bo, very innocent--oh, she's a cute one!--she says, 'Why, Mister\n",
      "Turner--is it really yours?' An' she looked so full of joy thet when he\n",
      "says to me, 'Excoose us, friend Carmichael,' I sat there like a locoed\n",
      "jackass an' let them go. But I wasn't mad at thet. He was a better\n",
      "dancer than me an' I wanted her to have a good time. What started the\n",
      "hell was I seen him put his arm round her when it wasn't just time,\n",
      "accordin' to the dance, an' Bo--she didn't break any records gettin'\n",
      "away from him. She pushed him away--after a little--after I near died.\n",
      "Wal, on the way home I had to tell her. I shore did. An' she said what\n",
      "I'd love to forget. Then--then, Miss Nell, I grabbed her--it was outside\n",
      "here by the porch an' all bright moonlight--I grabbed her an' hugged an'\n",
      "kissed her good. When I let her go I says, sorta brave, but I was plumb\n",
      "scared--I says, 'Wal, are you goin' to marry me now?'”\n",
      "\n",
      "He concluded with a gulp, and looked at Helen with woe in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! What did Bo do?” breathlessly queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She slapped me,” he replied. “An' then she says, I did like you best,\n",
      "but NOW I hate you!' An' she slammed the door in my face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you made a great mistake,” said Helen, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if I thought so I'd beg her forgiveness. But I reckon I don't.\n",
      "What's more, I feel better than before. I'm only a cowboy an' never was\n",
      "much good till I met her. Then I braced. I got to havin' hopes, studyin'\n",
      "books, an' you know how I've been lookin' into this ranchin' game. I\n",
      "stopped drinkin' an' saved my money. Wal, she knows all thet. Once she\n",
      "said she was proud of me. But it didn't seem to count big with her.\n",
      "An' if it can't count big I don't want it to count at all. I reckon the\n",
      "madder Bo is at me the more chance I've got. She knows I love her--thet\n",
      "I'd die for her--thet I'm a changed man. An' she knows I never before\n",
      "thought of darin' to touch her hand. An' she knows she flirted with\n",
      "Turner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's only a child,” replied Helen. “And all this change--the West--the\n",
      "wildness--and you boys making much of her--why, it's turned her head.\n",
      "But Bo will come out of it true blue. She is good, loving. Her heart is\n",
      "gold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I know, an' my faith can't be shook,” rejoined Carmichael,\n",
      "simply. “But she ought to believe thet she'll make bad blood out\n",
      "here. The West is the West. Any kind of girls are scarce. An' one like\n",
      "Bo--Lord! we cowboys never seen none to compare with her. She'll make\n",
      "bad blood an' some of it will be spilled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al encourages her,” said Helen, apprehensively. “It tickles him\n",
      "to hear how the boys are after her. Oh, she doesn't tell him. But he\n",
      "hears. And I, who must stand in mother's place to her, what can I do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, are you on my side?” asked the cowboy, wistfully. He was\n",
      "strong and elemental, caught in the toils of some power beyond him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday Helen might have hesitated at that question. But to-day\n",
      "Carmichael brought some proven quality of loyalty, some strange depth of\n",
      "rugged sincerity, as if she had learned his future worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am,” Helen replied, earnestly. And she offered her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, then it 'll shore turn out happy,” he said, squeezing her hand.\n",
      "His smile was grateful, but there was nothing in it of the victory he\n",
      "hinted at. Some of his ruddy color had gone. “An' now I want to tell you\n",
      "why I come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had lowered his voice. “Is Al asleep?” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Helen. “He was a little while ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I'd better shut his door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched the cowboy glide across the room and carefully close the\n",
      "door, then return to her with intent eyes. She sensed events in his\n",
      "look, and she divined suddenly that he must feel as if he were her\n",
      "brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'm the one thet fetches all the bad news to you,” he said,\n",
      "regretfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen caught her breath. There had indeed been many little calamities\n",
      "to mar her management of the ranch--loss of cattle, horses, sheep--the\n",
      "desertion of herders to Beasley--failure of freighters to arrive\n",
      "when most needed--fights among the cowboys--and disagreements over\n",
      "long-arranged deals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your uncle Al makes a heap of this here Jeff Mulvey,” asserted\n",
      "Carmichael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed. Uncle absolutely relies on Jeff,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I hate to tell you, Miss Nell,” said the cowboy, bitterly, “thet\n",
      "Mulvey ain't the man he seems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, what do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When your uncle dies Mulvey is goin' over to Beasley an' he's goin' to\n",
      "take all the fellars who'll stick to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Could Jeff be so faithless--after so many years my uncle's foreman? Oh,\n",
      "how do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I guessed long ago. But wasn't shore. Miss Nell, there's a\n",
      "lot in the wind lately, as poor old Al grows weaker. Mulvey has been\n",
      "particular friendly to me an' I've nursed him along, 'cept I wouldn't\n",
      "drink. An' his pards have been particular friends with me, too, more\n",
      "an' more as I loosened up. You see, they was shy of me when I first got\n",
      "here. To-day the whole deal showed clear to me like a hoof track in soft\n",
      "ground. Bud Lewis, who's bunked with me, come out an' tried to win me\n",
      "over to Beasley--soon as Auchincloss dies. I palavered with Bud an' I\n",
      "wanted to know. But Bud would only say he was goin' along with Jeff an'\n",
      "others of the outfit. I told him I'd reckon over it an' let him know. He\n",

      "“After Al dies the ranch will go to you. Beasley means to have it. He\n",
      "an' Al was pards once, an' now Beasley has most folks here believin' he\n",
      "got the short end of thet deal. He'll have papers--shore--an' he'll have\n",
      "most of the men. So he'll just put you off an' take possession. Thet's\n",
      "all, Miss Nell, an' you can rely on its bein' true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I believe you--but I can't believe such--such robbery possible,”\n",
      " gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's simple as two an' two. Possession is law out here. Once Beasley\n",
      "gets on the ground it's settled. What could you do with no men to fight\n",
      "for your property?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, surely, some of the men will stay with me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon. But not enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I can hire more. The Beeman boys. And Dale would come to help me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale would come. An' he'd help a heap. I wish he was here,” replied\n",
      "Carmichael, soberly. “But there's no way to get him. He's snowed-up till\n",
      "May.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare not confide in uncle,” said Helen, with agitation. “The shock\n",
      "might kill him. Then to tell him of the unfaithfulness of his old\n",
      "men--that would be cruel.... Oh, it can't be so bad as you think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon it couldn't be no worse. An'--Miss Nell, there's only one way\n",
      "to get out of it--an' thet's the way of the West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How?” queried Helen, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael lunged himself erect and stood gazing down at her. He seemed\n",
      "completely detached now from that frank, amiable cowboy of her first\n",
      "impressions. The redness was totally gone from his face. Something\n",
      "strange and cold and sure looked out of his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen Beasley go in the saloon as I rode past. Suppose I go down\n",
      "there, pick a quarrel with him--an' kill him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen sat bolt-upright with a cold shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael! you're not serious?” she exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serious? I shore am. Thet's the only way, Miss Nell. An' I reckon it's\n",
      "what Al would want. An' between you an' me--it would be easier than\n",
      "ropin' a calf. These fellars round Pine don't savvy guns. Now, I come\n",
      "from where guns mean somethin'. An' when I tell you I can throw a gun\n",
      "slick an' fast, why I shore ain't braggin'. You needn't worry none about\n",
      "me, Miss Nell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen grasped that he had taken the signs of her shocked sensibility\n",
      "to mean she feared for his life. But what had sickened her was the mere\n",
      "idea of bloodshed in her behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'd--kill Beasley--just because there are rumors of his--treachery?”\n",
      " gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. It'll have to be done, anyhow,” replied the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! No! It's too dreadful to think of. Why, that would be murder. I--I\n",
      "can't understand how you speak of it--so--so calmly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I ain't doin' it calmly. I'm as mad as hell,” said Carmichael,\n",
      "with a reckless smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, if you are serious then, I say no--no--no! I forbid you. I don't\n",

      "\n",
      "“Wal, supposin' Beasley does put you off--an' takes possession. What 're\n",
      "you goin' to say then?” demanded the cowboy, in slow, cool deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd say the same then as now,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent his head thoughtfully while his red hands smoothed his sombrero.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore you girls haven't been West very long,” he muttered, as if\n",
      "apologizing for them. “An' I reckon it takes time to learn the ways of a\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“West or no West, I won't have fights deliberately picked, and men shot,\n",
      "even if they do threaten me,” declared Helen, positively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, Miss Nell, shore I respect your wishes,” he returned. “But\n",
      "I'll tell you this. If Beasley turns you an' Bo out of your home--wal,\n",
      "I'll look him up on my own account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could only gaze at him as he backed to the door, and she thrilled\n",
      "and shuddered at what seemed his loyalty to her, his love for Bo, and\n",
      "that which was inevitable in himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you might save us all some trouble--now if you'd--just get\n",
      "mad--an' let me go after thet greaser.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Greaser! Do you mean Beasley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. He's a half-breed. He was born in Magdalena, where I heard folks\n",
      "say nary one of his parents was no good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That doesn't matter. I'm thinking of humanity of law and order. Of what\n",
      "is right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Miss Nell, I'll wait till you get real mad--or till Beasley--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, my friend, I'll not get mad,” interrupted Helen. “I'll keep my\n",
      "temper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet you don't,” he retorted. “Mebbe you think you've none of Bo in\n",
      "you. But I'll bet you could get so mad--once you started--thet you'd\n",
      "be turrible. What 've you got them eyes for, Miss Nell, if you ain't an\n",
      "Auchincloss?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was smiling, yet he meant every word. Helen felt the truth as\n",
      "something she feared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I won't bet. But you--you will always come to me--first--if\n",
      "there's trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise,” he replied, soberly, and then went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen found that she was trembling, and that there was a commotion in\n",
      "her breast. Carmichael had frightened her. No longer did she hold doubt\n",
      "of the gravity of the situation. She had seen Beasley often, several\n",
      "times close at hand, and once she had been forced to meet him. That time\n",
      "had convinced her that he had evinced personal interest in her. And on\n",
      "this account, coupled with the fact that Riggs appeared to have nothing\n",
      "else to do but shadow her, she had been slow in developing her intention\n",
      "of organizing and teaching a school for the children of Pine. Riggs had\n",
      "become rather a doubtful celebrity in the settlements. Yet his bold,\n",
      "apparent badness had made its impression. From all reports he spent his\n",
      "time gambling, drinking, and bragging. It was no longer news in Pine\n",
      "what his intentions were toward Helen Rayner. Twice he had ridden up to\n",
      "the ranch-house, upon one occasion securing an interview with Helen. In\n",
      "spite of her contempt and indifference, he was actually influencing her\n",
      "life there in Pine. And it began to appear that the other man, Beasley,\n",
      "might soon direct stronger significance upon the liberty of her actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The responsibility of the ranch had turned out to be a heavy burden. It\n",
      "could not be managed, at least by her, in the way Auchincloss wanted\n",
      "it done. He was old, irritable, irrational, and hard. Almost all the\n",
      "neighbors were set against him, and naturally did not take kindly to\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not found the slightest evidence of unfair dealing on the part\n",
      "of her uncle, but he had been a hard driver. Then his shrewd, far-seeing\n",
      "judgment had made all his deals fortunate for him, which fact had not\n",
      "brought a profit of friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of late, since Auchincloss had grown weaker and less dominating, Helen\n",
      "had taken many decisions upon herself, with gratifying and hopeful\n",
      "results. But the wonderful happiness that she had expected to find in\n",
      "the West still held aloof. The memory of Paradise Park seemed only a\n",
      "dream, sweeter and more intangible as time passed, and fuller of vague\n",
      "regrets. Bo was a comfort, but also a very considerable source of\n",
      "anxiety. She might have been a help to Helen if she had not assimilated\n",
      "Western ways so swiftly. Helen wished to decide things in her own way,\n",
      "which was as yet quite far from Western. So Helen had been thrown more\n",
      "and more upon her own resources, with the cowboy Carmichael the only one\n",
      "who had come forward voluntarily to her aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an hour Helen sat alone in the room, looking out of the window, and\n",
      "facing stern reality with a colder, graver, keener sense of intimacy\n",
      "than ever before. To hold her property and to live her life in this\n",
      "community according to her ideas of honesty, justice, and law might well\n",
      "be beyond her powers. To-day she had been convinced that she could not\n",
      "do so without fighting for them, and to fight she must have friends.\n",
      "That conviction warmed her toward Carmichael, and a thoughtful\n",
      "consideration of all he had done for her proved that she had not fully\n",
      "appreciated him. She would make up for her oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no Mormons in her employ, for the good reason that\n",
      "Auchincloss would not hire them. But in one of his kindlier hours,\n",
      "growing rare now, he had admitted that the Mormons were the best and the\n",
      "most sober, faithful workers on the ranges, and that his sole objection\n",
      "to them was just this fact of their superiority. Helen decided to hire\n",
      "the four Beemans and any of their relatives or friends who would come;\n",
      "and to do this, if possible, without letting her uncle know. His temper\n",
      "now, as well as his judgment, was a hindrance to efficiency. This\n",
      "decision regarding the Beemans; brought Helen back to Carmichael's\n",
      "fervent wish for Dale, and then to her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon spring would be at hand, with its multiplicity of range tasks. Dale\n",
      "had promised to come to Pine then, and Helen knew that promise would be\n",
      "kept. Her heart beat a little faster, in spite of her business-centered\n",
      "thoughts. Dale was there, over the black-sloped, snowy-tipped mountain,\n",
      "shut away from the world. Helen almost envied him. No wonder he loved\n",
      "loneliness, solitude, the sweet, wild silence and beauty of Paradise\n",
      "Park! But he was selfish, and Helen meant to show him that. She needed\n",
      "his help. When she recalled his physical prowess with animals, and\n",
      "imagined what it must be in relation to men, she actually smiled at the\n",
      "thought of Beasley forcing her off her property, if Dale were there.\n",
      "Beasley would only force disaster upon himself. Then Helen experienced\n",
      "a quick shock. Would Dale answer to this situation as Carmichael had\n",
      "answered? It afforded her relief to assure herself to the contrary.\n",
      "The cowboy was one of a blood-letting breed; the hunter was a man of\n",
      "thought, gentleness, humanity. This situation was one of the kind that\n",
      "had made him despise the littleness of men. Helen assured herself\n",
      "that he was different from her uncle and from the cowboy, in all the\n",
      "relations of life which she had observed while with him. But a doubt\n",
      "lingered in her mind. She remembered his calm reference to Snake Anson,\n",
      "and that caused a recurrence of the little shiver Carmichael had given\n",
      "her. When the doubt augmented to a possibility that she might not be\n",
      "able to control Dale, then she tried not to think of it any more. It\n",
      "confused and perplexed her that into her mind should flash a thought\n",
      "that, though it would be dreadful for Carmichael to kill Beasley, for\n",
      "Dale to do it would be a calamity--a terrible thing. Helen did not\n",
      "analyze that strange thought. She was as afraid of it as she was of the\n",
      "stir in her blood when she visualized Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her meditation was interrupted by Bo, who entered the room,\n",
      "rebellious-eyed and very lofty. Her manner changed, which apparently\n",
      "owed its cause to the fact that Helen was alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that--cowboy gone?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. He left quite some time ago,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wondered if he made your eyes shine--your color burn so. Nell, you're\n",
      "just beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is my face burning?” asked Helen, with a little laugh. “So it is.\n",
      "Well, Bo, you've no cause for jealousy. Las Vegas can't be blamed for my\n",
      "blushes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jealous! Me? Of that wild-eyed, soft-voiced, two-faced cow-puncher? I\n",
      "guess not, Nell Rayner. What 'd he say about me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, he said a lot,” replied Helen, reflectively. “I'll tell you\n",
      "presently. First I want to ask you--has Carmichael ever told you how\n",
      "he's helped me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! When I see him--which hasn't been often lately--he--I--Well, we\n",
      "fight. Nell, has he helped you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen smiled in faint amusement. She was going to be sincere, but she\n",
      "meant to keep her word to the cowboy. The fact was that reflection had\n",
      "acquainted her with her indebtedness to Carmichael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you've been so wild to ride half-broken mustangs--and carry on with\n",
      "cowboys--and read--and sew--and keep your secrets that you've had no\n",
      "time for your sister or her troubles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!” burst out Bo, in amaze and pain. She flew to Helen and seized\n",
      "her hands. “What 're you saying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's all true,” replied Helen, thrilling and softening. This sweet\n",
      "sister, once aroused, would be hard to resist. Helen imagined she should\n",
      "hold to her tone of reproach and severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure it's true,” cried Bo, fiercely. “But what's my fooling got to do\n",
      "with the--the rest you said? Nell, are you keeping things from me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, I never get any encouragement to tell you my troubles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I've--I've nursed uncle--sat up with him--just the same as you,”\n",
      " said Bo, with quivering lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you've been good to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We've no other troubles, have we, Nell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You haven't, but I have,” responded Helen, reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--why didn't you tell me?” cried Bo, passionately. “What are they?\n",
      "Tell me now. You must think me a--a selfish, hateful cat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I've had much to worry me--and the worst is yet to come,” replied\n",
      "Helen. Then she told Bo how complicated and bewildering was the\n",
      "management of a big ranch--when the owner was ill, testy, defective in\n",
      "memory, and hard as steel--when he had hoards of gold and notes, but\n",
      "could not or would not remember his obligations--when the neighbor\n",
      "ranchers had just claims--when cowboys and sheep-herders were\n",
      "discontented, and wrangled among themselves--when great herds of cattle\n",
      "and flocks of sheep had to be fed in winter--when supplies had to be\n",
      "continually freighted across a muddy desert and lastly, when an enemy\n",
      "rancher was slowly winning away the best hands with the end in view of\n",
      "deliberately taking over the property when the owner died. Then Helen\n",
      "told how she had only that day realized the extent of Carmichael's\n",
      "advice and help and labor--how, indeed, he had been a brother to\n",
      "her--how--\n",
      "\n",
      "But at this juncture Bo buried her face in Helen's breast and began to\n",
      "cry wildly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I--don't want--to hear--any more,” she sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you've got to hear it,” replied Helen, inexorably “I want you to\n",
      "know how he's stood by me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I hate him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I suspect that's not true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do--I do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you act and talk very strangely then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell Rayner--are--you--you sticking up for that--that devil?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am, yes, so far as it concerns my conscience,” rejoined Helen,\n",
      "earnestly. “I never appreciated him as he deserved--not until now. He's\n",
      "a man, Bo, every inch of him. I've seen him grow up to that in three\n",
      "months. I'd never have gotten along without him. I think he's fine,\n",
      "manly, big. I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet--he's made love--to you, too,” replied Bo, woefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talk sense,” said Helen, sharply. “He has been a brother to me. But,\n",
      "Bo Rayner, if he HAD made love to me I--I might have appreciated it more\n",
      "than you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo raised her face, flushed in part and also pale, with tear-wet cheeks\n",
      "and the telltale blaze in the blue eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've been wild about that fellow. But I hate him, too,” she said, with\n",
      "flashing spirit. “And I want to go on hating him. So don't tell me any\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Helen briefly and graphically related how Carmichael had\n",
      "offered to kill Beasley, as the only way to save her property, and how,\n",
      "when she refused, that he threatened he would do it anyhow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo fell over with a gasp and clung to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--Nell! Oh, now I love him more than--ever,” she cried, in mingled\n",
      "rage and despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen clasped her closely and tried to comfort her as in the old days,\n",
      "not so very far back, when troubles were not so serious as now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you love him,” she concluded. “I guessed that long ago. And\n",
      "I'm glad. But you've been wilful--foolish. You wouldn't surrender to it.\n",
      "You wanted your fling with the other boys. You're--Oh, Bo, I fear you\n",
      "have been a sad little flirt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I wasn't very bad till--till he got bossy. Why, Nell, he\n",
      "acted--right off--just as if he OWNED me. But he didn't.... And to show\n",
      "him--I--I really did flirt with that Turner fellow. Then he--he insulted\n",
      "me.... Oh, I hate him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense, Bo. You can't hate any one while you love him,” protested\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much you know about that,” flashed Bo. “You just can! Look here. Did\n",
      "you ever see a cowboy rope and throw and tie up a mean horse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you have any idea how strong a cowboy is--how his hands and arms are\n",
      "like iron?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'm sure I know that, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how savage he is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how he goes at anything he wants to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must admit cowboys are abrupt,” responded Helen, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Miss Rayner, did you ever--when you were standing quiet like a\n",
      "lady--did you ever have a cowboy dive at you with a terrible lunge--grab\n",
      "you and hold you so you couldn't move or breathe or scream--hug you\n",
      "till all your bones cracked--and kiss you so fierce and so hard that you\n",
      "wanted to kill him and die?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had gradually drawn back from this blazing-eyed, eloquent sister,\n",
      "and when the end of that remarkable question came it was impossible to\n",
      "reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! I see you never had that done to you,” resumed Bo, with\n",
      "satisfaction. “So don't ever talk to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've heard his side of the story,” said Helen, constrainedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a start Bo sat up straighter, as if better to defend herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So you have? And I suppose you'll take his part--even about\n",
      "that--that bearish trick.”\n",
      "\n",

      "seems girls can't play at love out here in this wild West. He said there\n",
      "would be blood shed over you. I begin to realize what he meant. He's\n",
      "not sorry for what he did. Think how strange that is. For he has the\n",
      "instincts of a gentleman. He's kind, gentle, chivalrous. Evidently he\n",
      "had tried every way to win your favor except any familiar advance. He\n",
      "did that as a last resort. In my opinion his motives were to force you\n",
      "to accept or refuse him, and in case you refused him he'd always have\n",
      "those forbidden stolen kisses to assuage his self-respect--when he\n",
      "thought of Turner or any one else daring to be familiar with you. Bo,\n",

      "\n",
      "When spring came at last and the willows drooped green and fresh over\n",
      "the brook and the range rang with bray of burro and whistle of stallion,\n",
      "old Al Auchincloss had been a month in his grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen it seemed longer. The month had been crowded with work, events,\n",
      "and growing, more hopeful duties, so that it contained a world\n",
      "of living. The uncle had not been forgotten, but the innumerable\n",
      "restrictions to development and progress were no longer manifest.\n",
      "Beasley had not presented himself or any claim upon Helen; and she,\n",
      "gathering confidence day by day, began to believe all that purport of\n",
      "trouble had been exaggerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this time she had come to love her work and all that pertained to it.\n",
      "The estate was large. She had no accurate knowledge of how many acres\n",
      "she owned, but it was more than two thousand. The fine, old, rambling\n",
      "ranch-house, set like a fort on the last of the foot-hills, corrals and\n",
      "fields and barns and meadows, and the rolling green range beyond, and\n",
      "innumerable sheep, horses, cattle--all these belonged to Helen, to her\n",
      "ever-wondering realization and ever-growing joy. Still, she was afraid\n",
      "to let herself go and be perfectly happy. Always there was the fear that\n",
      "had been too deep and strong to forget so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bright, fresh morning, in March, Helen came out upon the porch to\n",
      "revel a little in the warmth of sunshine and the crisp, pine-scented\n",
      "wind that swept down from the mountains. There was never a morning that\n",
      "she did not gaze mountainward, trying to see, with a folly she realized,\n",
      "if the snow had melted more perceptibly away on the bold white ridge.\n",
      "For all she could see it had not melted an inch, and she would\n",
      "not confess why she sighed. The desert had become green and fresh,\n",
      "stretching away there far below her range, growing dark and purple in\n",
      "the distance with vague buttes rising. The air was full of sound--notes\n",
      "of blackbirds and the baas of sheep, and blasts from the corrals, and\n",
      "the clatter of light hoofs on the court below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was riding in from the stables. Helen loved to watch her on one of\n",
      "those fiery little mustangs, but the sight was likewise given to rousing\n",
      "apprehensions. This morning Bo appeared particularly bent on frightening\n",
      "Helen. Down the lane Carmichael appeared, waving his arms, and Helen\n",
      "at once connected him with Bo's manifest desire to fly away from that\n",
      "particular place. Since that day, a month back, when Bo had confessed\n",
      "her love for Carmichael, she and Helen had not spoken of it or of the\n",
      "cowboy. The boy and girl were still at odds. But this did not worry\n",
      "Helen. Bo had changed much for the better, especially in that she\n",
      "devoted herself to Helen and to her work. Helen knew that all would\n",
      "turn out well in the end, and so she had been careful of her rather\n",
      "precarious position between these two young firebrands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo reined in the mustang at the porch steps. She wore a buckskin\n",
      "riding-suit which she had made herself, and its soft gray with the\n",
      "touches of red beads was mightily becoming to her. Then she had grown\n",
      "considerably during the winter and now looked too flashing and pretty to\n",
      "resemble a boy, yet singularly healthy and strong and lithe. Red spots\n",
      "shone in her cheeks and her eyes held that ever-dangerous blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, did you give me away to that cowboy?” she demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give you away!” exclaimed Helen, blankly.\n",

      "“Yes. You know I told you--awhile back--that I was wildly in love with\n",

      "She might have been furious, but she certainly was not confused.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Reckon some one's got to be your boss,” drawled Carmichael. “Shore I\n",
      "ain't hankerin' for the job. You could ride to Kingdom Come or off among\n",
      "the Apaches--or over here a ways”--at this he grinned knowingly--“or\n",
      "anywheres, for all I cared. But I'm workin' for Miss Nell, an' she's\n",
      "boss. An' if she says you're not to take them rides--you won't. Savvy\n",

      "riding where I like?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if you're goin' worse locoed this way I'll keep you off'n a hoss\n",

      "\n",
      "His dry humor was gone and manifestly he meant what he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "“if--you--ever--touch--me again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this he flushed, then made a quick, passionate gesture with his hand,\n",
      "expressive of heat and shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You an' me will never get along,” he said, with a dignity full of\n",
      "pathos. “I seen thet a month back when you changed sudden-like to me.\n",
      "But nothin' I say to you has any reckonin' of mine. I'm talkin' for your\n",
      "sister. It's for her sake. An' your own.... I never told her an' I never\n",
      "told you thet I've seen Riggs sneakin' after you twice on them desert\n",
      "rides. Wal, I tell you now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The intelligence apparently had not the slightest effect on Bo. But\n",
      "Helen was astonished and alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs! Oh, Bo, I've seen him myself--riding around. He does not mean\n",
      "well. You must be careful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I ketch him again,” went on Carmichael, with his mouth lining hard,\n",
      "“I'm goin' after him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave her a cool, intent, piercing look, then he dropped his head and\n",

      "cowboy pass out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A month back--when I changed sudden-like,” mused Bo. “I wonder what he\n",
      "meant by that.... Nell, did I change--right after the talk you had with\n",
      "me--about him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed you did, Bo,” replied Helen. “But it was for the better. Only\n",
      "he can't see it. How proud and sensitive he is! You wouldn't guess it\n",
      "at first. Bo, your reserve has wounded him more than your flirting. He\n",
      "thinks it's indifference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe that 'll be good for him,” declared Bo. “Does he expect me to\n",
      "fall on his neck? He's that thick-headed! Why, he's the locoed one, not\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd like to ask you, Bo, if you've seen how he has changed?” queried\n",
      "Helen, earnestly. “He's older. He's worried. Either his heart is\n",
      "breaking for you or else he fears trouble for us. I fear it's both. How\n",
      "he watches you! Bo, he knows all you do--where you go. That about Riggs\n",
      "sickens me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Riggs follows me and tries any of his four-flush desperado games\n",
      "he'll have his hands full,” said Bo, grimly. “And that without my cowboy\n",
      "protector! But I just wish Riggs would do something. Then we'll see what\n",
      "Las Vegas Tom Carmichael cares. Then we'll see!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo bit out the last words passionately and jealously, then she lifted\n",
      "her bridle to the spirited mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, don't you fear for me,” she said. “I can take care of myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched her ride away, all but willing to confess that there\n",
      "might be truth in what Bo said. Then Helen went about her work, which\n",
      "consisted of routine duties as well as an earnest study to familiarize\n",
      "herself with continually new and complex conditions of ranch life. Every\n",
      "day brought new problems. She made notes of all that she observed, and\n",
      "all that was told her, which habit she had found, after a few weeks of\n",
      "trial, was going to be exceedingly valuable to her. She did not intend\n",
      "always to be dependent upon the knowledge of hired men, however faithful\n",
      "some of them might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning on her rounds she had expected developments of some kind,\n",
      "owing to the presence of Roy Beeman and two of his brothers, who had\n",
      "arrived yesterday. And she was to discover that Jeff Mulvey, accompanied\n",
      "by six of his co-workers and associates, had deserted her without a word\n",
      "or even sending for their pay. Carmichael had predicted this. Helen had\n",
      "half doubted. It was a relief now to be confronted with facts, however\n",
      "disturbing. She had fortified herself to withstand a great deal more\n",
      "trouble than had happened. At the gateway of the main corral, a huge\n",
      "inclosure fenced high with peeled logs, she met Roy Beeman, lasso in\n",
      "hand, the same tall, lean, limping figure she remembered so well.\n",
      "Sight of him gave her an inexplicable thrill--a flashing memory of an\n",
      "unforgettable night ride. Roy was to have charge of the horses on the\n",
      "ranch, of which there were several hundred, not counting many lost on\n",
      "range and mountain, or the unbranded colts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy took off his sombrero and greeted her. This Mormon had a courtesy\n",
      "for women that spoke well for him. Helen wished she had more employees\n",
      "like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's jest as Las Vegas told us it 'd be,” he said, regretfully. “Mulvey\n",
      "an' his pards lit out this mornin'. I'm sorry, Miss Helen. Reckon thet's\n",
      "all because I come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard the news,” replied Helen. “You needn't be sorry, Roy, for I'm\n",
      "not. I'm glad. I want to know whom I can trust.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas says we're shore in for it now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, what do you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon so. Still, Las Vegas is powerful cross these days an' always\n",
      "lookin' on the dark side. With us boys, now, it's sufficient unto the\n",
      "day is the evil thereof. But, Miss Helen, if Beasley forces the deal\n",
      "there will be serious trouble. I've seen thet happen. Four or five years\n",
      "ago Beasley rode some greasers off their farms an' no one ever knowed if\n",
      "he had a just claim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley has no claim on my property. My uncle solemnly swore that on\n",
      "his death-bed. And I find nothing in his books or papers of those years\n",
      "when he employed Beasley. In fact, Beasley was never uncle's partner.\n",
      "The truth is that my uncle took Beasley up when he was a poor, homeless\n",
      "boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So my old dad says,” replied Roy. “But what's right don't always\n",

      "\n",

      "you think will happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beeman appeared flattered, but he hesitated to reply. Helen had long\n",
      "been aware of the reticence of these outdoor men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you mean cause an' effect, as Milt Dale would say,” responded\n",
      "Roy, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. If Beasley attempts to force me off my ranch what will happen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy looked up and met her gaze. Helen remembered that singular\n",
      "stillness, intentness of his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if Dale an' John get here in time I reckon we can bluff thet\n",
      "Beasley outfit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean my friends--my men would confront Beasley--refuse his\n",
      "demands--and if necessary fight him off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shore do,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But suppose you're not all here? Beasley would be smart enough to\n",
      "choose an opportune time. Suppose he did put me off and take possession?\n",
      "What then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it 'd only be a matter of how soon Dale or Carmichael--or I--got\n",
      "to Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy! I feared just that. It haunts me. Carmichael asked me to let him\n",
      "go pick a fight with Beasley. Asked me, just as he would ask me about\n",
      "his work! I was shocked. And now you say Dale--and you--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen choked in her agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, what else could you look for? Las Vegas is in love with\n",
      "Miss Bo. Shore he told me so. An' Dale's in love with you!... Why, you\n",
      "couldn't stop them any more 'n you could stop the wind from blowin' down\n",
      "a pine, when it got ready.... Now, it's some different with me. I'm a\n",
      "Mormon an' I'm married. But I'm Dale's pard, these many years. An'\n",
      "I care a powerful sight for you an' Miss Bo. So I reckon I'd draw on\n",
      "Beasley the first chance I got.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen strove for utterance, but it was denied her. Roy's simple\n",
      "statement of Dale's love had magnified her emotion by completely\n",
      "changing its direction. She forgot what she had felt wretched about. She\n",
      "could not look at Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, don't feel bad,” he said, kindly. “Shore you're not to\n",
      "blame. Your comin' West hasn't made any difference in Beasley's fate,\n",
      "except mebbe to hurry it a little. My dad is old, an' when he talks\n",
      "it's like history. He looks back on happenin's. Wal, it's the nature of\n",
      "happenin's that Beasley passes away before his prime. Them of his breed\n",
      "don't live old in the West.... So I reckon you needn't feel bad or\n",
      "worry. You've got friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen incoherently thanked him, and, forgetting her usual round of\n",
      "corrals and stables, she hurried back toward the house, deeply stirred,\n",
      "throbbing and dim-eyed, with a feeling she could not control. Roy Beeman\n",
      "had made a statement that had upset her equilibrium. It seemed simple\n",
      "and natural, yet momentous and staggering. To hear that Dale loved\n",
      "her--to hear it spoken frankly, earnestly, by Dale's best friend, was\n",
      "strange, sweet, terrifying. But was it true? Her own consciousness had\n",
      "admitted it. Yet that was vastly different from a man's open statement.\n",
      "No longer was it a dear dream, a secret that seemed hers alone. How she\n",
      "had lived on that secret hidden deep in her breast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Something burned the dimness from her eyes as she looked toward the\n",
      "mountains and her sight became clear, telescopic with its intensity.\n",
      "Magnificently the mountains loomed. Black inroads and patches on the\n",
      "slopes showed where a few days back all bad been white. The snow was\n",
      "melting fast. Dale would soon be free to ride down to Pine. And that was\n",
      "an event Helen prayed for, yet feared as she had never feared anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The noonday dinner-bell startled Helen from a reverie that was a\n",
      "pleasant aftermath of her unrestraint. How the hours had flown! This\n",
      "morning at least must be credited to indolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was not in the dining-room, nor in her own room, nor was she in\n",
      "sight from window or door. This absence had occurred before, but not\n",
      "particularly to disturb Helen. In this instance, however, she grew\n",
      "worried. Her nerves presaged strain. There was an overcharge of\n",
      "sensibility in her feelings or a strange pressure in the very\n",
      "atmosphere. She ate dinner alone, looking her apprehension, which was\n",
      "not mitigated by the expressive fears of old Maria, the Mexican woman\n",
      "who served her.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner she sent word to Roy and Carmichael that they had better\n",
      "ride out to look for Bo. Then Helen applied herself resolutely to her\n",
      "books until a rapid clatter of hoofs out in the court caused her to jump\n",
      "up and hurry to the porch. Roy was riding in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you find her?” queried Helen, hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't no track or sign of her up the north range,” replied Roy, as he\n",
      "dismounted and threw his bridle. “An' I was ridin' back to take up her\n",
      "tracks from the corral an' trail her. But I seen Las Vegas comin' an' he\n",
      "waved his sombrero. He was comin' up from the south. There he is now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael appeared swinging into the lane. He was mounted on Helen's\n",
      "big black Ranger, and he made the dust fly.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, she's comin',” said the cowboy, as he reined in and\n",
      "slid down with his graceful single motion. Then in a violent action,\n",
      "characteristic of him, he slammed his sombrero down on the porch and\n",
      "threw up both arms. “I've a hunch it's come off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, what?” exclaimed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Las Vegas, talk sense,” expostulated Roy. “Miss Helen is shore\n",
      "nervous to-day. Has anythin' happened?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon, but I don't know what,” replied Carmichael, drawing a long\n",
      "breath. “Folks, I must be gettin' old. For I shore felt orful queer till\n",
      "I seen Bo. She was ridin' down the ridge across the valley. Ridin' some\n",
      "fast, too, an' she'll be here right off, if she doesn't stop in the\n",
      "village.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I hear her comin' now,” said Roy. “An'--if you asked me I'd say\n",
      "she WAS ridin' some fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen heard the light, swift, rhythmic beat of hoofs, and then out on\n",
      "the curve of the road that led down to Pine she saw Bo's mustang, white\n",
      "with lather, coming on a dead run.\n",

      "\n",
      "The cowboy made no reply, but he strode out from the porch, directly\n",
      "in front of the mustang. Bo was pulling hard on the bridle, and had him\n",
      "slowing down, but not controlled. When he reached the house it could\n",
      "easily be seen that Bo had pulled him to the limit of her strength,\n",
      "which was not enough to halt him. Carmichael lunged for the bridle and,\n",
      "seizing it, hauled him to a standstill.\n",
      "\n",
      "At close sight of Bo Helen uttered a startled cry. Bo was white; her\n",
      "sombrero was gone and her hair undone; there were blood and dirt on\n",
      "her face, and her riding-suit was torn and muddy. She had evidently\n",
      "sustained a fall. Roy gazed at her in admiring consternation, but\n",
      "Carmichael never looked at her at all. Apparently he was examining the\n",
      "horse. “Well, help me off--somebody,” cried Bo, peremptorily. Her voice\n",
      "was weak, but not her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy sprang to help her off, and when she was down it developed that she\n",
      "was lame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Bo! You've had a tumble,” exclaimed Helen, anxiously, and she ran\n",
      "to assist Roy. They led her up the porch and to the door. There she\n",
      "turned to look at Carmichael, who was still examining the spent mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell him--to come in,” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey, there, Las Vegas!” called Roy. “Rustle hyar, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bo had been led into the sitting-room and seated in a chair\n",
      "Carmichael entered. His face was a study, as slowly he walked up to Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girl, you--ain't hurt?” he asked, huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's no fault of yours that I'm not crippled--or dead or worse,”\n",
      " retorted Bo. “You said the south range was the only safe ride for me.\n",
      "And there--I--it happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She panted a little and her bosom heaved. One of her gauntlets was gone,\n",
      "and the bare band, that was bruised and bloody, trembled as she held it\n",
      "out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear, tell us--are you badly hurt?” queried Helen, with hurried\n",
      "gentleness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not much. I've had a spill,” replied Bo. “But oh! I'm mad--I'm\n",
      "boiling!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked as if she might have exaggerated her doubt of injuries, but\n",
      "certainly she had not overestimated her state of mind. Any blaze Helen\n",
      "had heretofore seen in those quick eyes was tame compared to this one.\n",
      "It actually leaped. Bo was more than pretty then. Manifestly Roy was\n",
      "admiring her looks, but Carmichael saw beyond her charm. And slowly he\n",
      "was growing pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I rode out the south range--as I was told,” began Bo, breathing hard\n",
      "and trying to control her feelings. “That's the ride you usually take,\n",
      "Nell, and you bet--if you'd taken it to-day--you'd not be here now....\n",
      "About three miles out I climbed off the range up that cedar slope. I\n",
      "always keep to high ground. When I got up I saw two horsemen ride out\n",
      "of some broken rocks off to the east. They rode as if to come between me\n",
      "and home. I didn't like that. I circled south. About a mile farther on I\n",
      "spied another horseman and he showed up directly in front of me and came\n",
      "along slow. That I liked still less. It might have been accident, but it\n",
      "looked to me as if those riders had some intent. All I could do was head\n",
      "off to the southeast and ride. You bet I did ride. But I got into rough\n",
      "ground where I'd never been before. It was slow going. At last I made\n",
      "the cedars and here I cut loose, believing I could circle ahead of those\n",
      "strange riders and come round through Pine. I had it wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she hesitated, perhaps for breath, for she had spoken rapidly, or\n",
      "perhaps to get better hold on her subject. Not improbably the effect she\n",
      "was creating on her listeners began to be significant. Roy sat absorbed,\n",
      "perfectly motionless, eyes keen as steel, his mouth open. Carmichael\n",
      "was gazing over Bo's head, out of the window, and it seemed that he\n",
      "must know the rest of her narrative. Helen knew that her own wide-eyed\n",
      "attention alone would have been all-compelling inspiration to Bo Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure I had it wrong,” resumed Bo. “Pretty soon heard a horse behind. I\n",
      "looked back. I saw a big bay riding down on me. Oh, but he was running!\n",
      "He just tore through the cedars. ... I was scared half out of my senses.\n",
      "But I spurred and beat my mustang. Then began a race! Rough going--thick\n",
      "cedars--washes and gullies I had to make him run--to keep my saddle--to\n",
      "pick my way. Oh-h-h! but it was glorious! To race for fun--that's\n",
      "one thing; to race for your life is another! My heart was in my\n",
      "mouth--choking me. I couldn't have yelled. I was as cold as ice--dizzy\n",
      "sometimes--blind others--then my stomach turned--and I couldn't get my\n",
      "breath. Yet the wild thrills I had!... But I stuck on and held my own\n",
      "for several miles--to the edge of the cedars. There the big horse gained\n",
      "on me. He came pounding closer--perhaps as close as a hundred yards--I\n",
      "could hear him plain enough. Then I had my spill. Oh, my mustang\n",
      "tripped--threw me 'way over his head. I hit light, but slid far--and\n",
      "that's what scraped me so. I know my knee is raw.... When I got to my\n",
      "feet the big horse dashed up, throwing gravel all over me--and his rider\n",
      "jumped off.... Now who do you think he was?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen knew, but she did not voice her conviction. Carmichael knew\n",
      "positively, yet he kept silent. Roy was smiling, as if the narrative\n",
      "told did not seem so alarming to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, the fact of you bein' here, safe an' sound, sorta makes no\n",
      "difference who thet son-of-a-gun was,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs! Harve Riggs!” blazed Bo. “The instant I recognized him I got\n",
      "over my scare. And so mad I burned all through like fire. I don't know\n",
      "what I said, but it was wild--and it was a whole lot, you bet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You sure can ride,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I demanded why he had dared to chase me, and he said he had an\n",
      "important message for Nell. This was it: 'Tell your sister that Beasley\n",
      "means to put her off an' take the ranch. If she'll marry me I'll block\n",
      "his deal. If she won't marry me, I'll go in with Beasley.' Then he told\n",
      "me to hurry home and not to breathe a word to any one except Nell. Well,\n",
      "here I am--and I seem to have been breathing rather fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked from Helen to Roy and from Roy to Las Vegas. Her smile was\n",
      "for the latter, and to any one not overexcited by her story that smile\n",
      "would have told volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'll be doggoned!” ejaculated Roy, feelingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, the working of that man's mind is beyond me.... Marry him to\n",
      "save my ranch? I wouldn't marry him to save my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael suddenly broke his silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, did you see the other men?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I was coming to that,” she replied. “I caught a glimpse of\n",
      "them back in the cedars. The three were together, or, at least, three\n",
      "horsemen were there. They had halted behind some trees. Then on the way\n",
      "home I began to think. Even in my fury I had received impressions. Riggs\n",
      "was SURPRISED when I got up. I'll bet he had not expected me to be who I\n",
      "was. He thought I was NELL!... I look bigger in this buckskin outfit. My\n",
      "hair was up till I lost my hat, and that was when I had the tumble. He\n",
      "took me for Nell. Another thing, I remember--he made some sign--some\n",
      "motion while I was calling him names, and I believe that was to keep\n",
      "those other men back.... I believe Riggs had a plan with those other men\n",
      "to waylay Nell and make off with her. I absolutely know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you're so--so--you jump at wild ideas so,” protested Helen, trying\n",
      "to believe in her own assurance. But inwardly she was trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, that ain't a wild idee,” said Roy, seriously. “I reckon\n",
      "your sister is pretty close on the trail. Las Vegas, don't you savvy it\n",
      "thet way?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael's answer was to stalk out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call him back!” cried Helen, apprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, boy!” called Roy, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen reached the door simultaneously with Roy. The cowboy picked up his\n",
      "sombrero, jammed it on his head, gave his belt a vicious hitch that made\n",
      "the gun-sheath jump, and then in one giant step he was astride Ranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael! Stay!” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy spurred the black, and the stones rang under iron-shod hoofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! Call him back! Please call him back!” importuned Helen, in\n",
      "distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't,” declared Bo Rayner. Her face shone whiter now and her eyes\n",
      "were like fiery flint. That was her answer to a loving, gentle-hearted\n",
      "sister; that was her answer to the call of the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No use,” said Roy, quietly. “An' I reckon I'd better trail him up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He, too, strode out and, mounting his horse, galloped swiftly away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out that Bo, was more bruised and scraped and shaken than she\n",
      "had imagined. One knee was rather badly cut, which injury alone would\n",
      "have kept her from riding again very soon. Helen, who was somewhat\n",
      "skilled at bandaging wounds, worried a great deal over these sundry\n",
      "blotches on Bo's fair skin, and it took considerable time to wash and\n",
      "dress them. Long after this was done, and during the early supper, and\n",
      "afterward, Bo's excitement remained unabated. The whiteness stayed on\n",
      "her face and the blaze in her eyes. Helen ordered and begged her to go\n",
      "to bed, for the fact was Bo could not stand up and her hands shook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to bed? Not much,” she said. “I want to know what he does to Riggs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was that possibility which had Helen in dreadful suspense. If\n",
      "Carmichael killed Riggs, it seemed to Helen that the bottom would\n",
      "drop out of this structure of Western life she had begun to build so\n",
      "earnestly and fearfully. She did not believe that he would do so. But\n",
      "the uncertainty was torturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Bo,” appealed Helen, “you don't want--Oh! you do want Carmichael\n",
      "to--to kill Riggs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don't, but I wouldn't care if he did,” replied Bo, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think--he will?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, if that cowboy really loves me he read my mind right here before\n",
      "he left,” declared Bo. “And he knew what I thought he'd do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what's--that?” faltered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want him to round Riggs up down in the village--somewhere in a crowd.\n",
      "I want Riggs shown up as the coward, braggart, four-flush that he is.\n",
      "And insulted, slapped, kicked--driven out of Pine!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her passionate speech still rang throughout the room when there came\n",
      "footsteps on the porch. Helen hurried to raise the bar from the door and\n",
      "open it just as a tap sounded on the door-post. Roy's face stood white\n",
      "out of the darkness. His eyes were bright. And his smile made Helen's\n",
      "fearful query needless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you-all this evenin'?” he drawled, as he came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fire blazed on the hearth and a lamp burned on the table. By their\n",
      "light Bo looked white and eager-eyed as she reclined in the big\n",
      "arm-chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What 'd he do?” she asked, with all her amazing force.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, now, ain't you goin' to tell me how you are?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, I'm all bunged up. I ought to be in bed, but I just couldn't sleep\n",
      "till I hear what Las Vegas did. I'd forgive anything except him getting\n",
      "drunk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I shore can ease your mind on thet,” replied Roy. “He never drank\n",
      "a drop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy was distractingly slow about beginning the tale any child could have\n",
      "guessed he was eager to tell. For once the hard, intent quietness, the\n",
      "soul of labor, pain, and endurance so plain in his face was softened by\n",
      "pleasurable emotion. He poked at the burning logs with the toe of his\n",
      "boot. Helen observed that he had changed his boots and now wore no\n",
      "spurs. Then he had gone to his quarters after whatever had happened down\n",
      "in Pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where IS he?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not Riggs. First tell me where HE is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, then, you must mean Las Vegas. I just left him down at the\n",
      "cabin. He was gettin' ready for bed, early as it is. All tired out he\n",
      "was an' thet white you wouldn't have knowed him. But he looked happy at\n",
      "thet, an' the last words he said, more to himself than to me, I reckon,\n",
      "was, 'I'm some locoed gent, but if she doesn't call me Tom now she's no\n",
      "good!'”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo actually clapped her hands, notwithstanding that one of them was\n",
      "bandaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call him Tom? I should smile I will,” she declared, in delight. “Hurry\n",
      "now--what 'd--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's shore powerful strange how he hates thet handle Las Vegas,” went\n",

      "\n",
      "“Roy, tell me what he did--what TOM did--or I'll scream,” cried Bo.\n",

      "appealing to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Roy, I never did,” agreed Helen. “But please--please tell us what\n",
      "has happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy grinned and rubbed his hands together in a dark delight, almost\n",
      "fiendish in its sudden revelation of a gulf of strange emotion deep\n",
      "within him. Whatever had happened to Riggs had not been too much for\n",
      "Roy Beeman. Helen remembered hearing her uncle say that a real Westerner\n",
      "hated nothing so hard as the swaggering desperado, the make-believe\n",
      "gunman who pretended to sail under the true, wild, and reckoning colors\n",
      "of the West.\n",

      "“When I rode out after Las Vegas I seen him 'way down the road,” began\n",
      "Roy, rapidly. “An' I seen another man ridin' down into Pine from the\n",
      "other side. Thet was Riggs, only I didn't know it then. Las Vegas rode\n",
      "up to the store, where some fellars was hangin' round, an' he spoke to\n",
      "them. When I come up they was all headin' for Turner's saloon. I seen a\n",
      "dozen hosses hitched to the rails. Las Vegas rode on. But I got off at\n",
      "Turner's an' went in with the bunch. Whatever it was Las Vegas said\n",
      "to them fellars, shore they didn't give him away. Pretty soon more men\n",
      "strolled into Turner's an' there got to be 'most twenty altogether, I\n",
      "reckon. Jeff Mulvey was there with his pards. They had been drinkin'\n",
      "sorta free. An' I didn't like the way Mulvey watched me. So I went\n",
      "out an' into the store, but kept a-lookin' for Las Vegas. He wasn't in\n",
      "sight. But I seen Riggs ridin' up. Now, Turner's is where Riggs hangs\n",
      "out an' does his braggin'. He looked powerful deep an' thoughtful,\n",
      "dismounted slow without seein' the unusual number of hosses there, an'\n",
      "then he slouches into Turner's. No more 'n a minute after Las Vegas rode\n",

      "\n",
      "“Before I got to Turner's door--an' thet was only a little ways--I heard\n",

      "of any cow-puncher I ever beard. Quicklike I opened the door an' slipped\n",
      "in. There was Riggs an' Las Vegas alone in the center of the big saloon,\n",
      "with the crowd edgin' to the walls an' slidin' back of the bar. Riggs\n",
      "was whiter 'n a dead man. I didn't hear an' I don't know what Las Vegas\n",

      "quick looks 'round. But he never moved a hand. There was somethin' tight\n",
      "about the way he stood. Las Vegas had both arms half out, stretched as\n",
      "if he meant to leap. But he wasn't. I never seen Las Vegas do thet, but\n",

      "The third day, however, Bo was better, and, refusing to remain in bed,\n",
      "she hobbled to the sitting-room, where she divided her time between\n",
      "staring out of the window toward the corrals and pestering Helen with\n",
      "questions she tried to make appear casual. But Helen saw through her\n",
      "case and was in a state of glee. What she hoped most for was that\n",
      "Carmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for Bo. It\n",
      "was that kind of treatment the young lady needed. And now was the great\n",
      "opportunity. Helen almost felt tempted to give the cowboy a hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither this day, nor the next, however, did he put in an appearance\n",
      "at the house, though Helen saw him twice on her rounds. He was busy, as\n",
      "usual, and greeted her as if nothing particular had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy called twice, once in the afternoon, and again during the evening.\n",
      "He grew more likable upon longer acquaintance. This last visit he\n",
      "rendered Bo speechless by teasing her about another girl Carmichael was\n",
      "going to take to a dance. Bo's face showed that her vanity could not\n",
      "believe this statement, but that her intelligence of young men credited\n",
      "it with being possible. Roy evidently was as penetrating as he was kind.\n",
      "He made a dry, casual little remark about the snow never melting on the\n",
      "mountains during the latter part of March; and the look with which he\n",
      "accompanied this remark brought a blush to Helen's cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Roy had departed Bo said to Helen: “Confound that fellow! He sees\n",
      "right through me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, you're rather transparent these days,” murmured Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You needn't talk. He gave you a dig,” retorted Bo. “He just knows\n",
      "you're dying to see the snow melt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracious! I hope I'm not so bad as that. Of course I want the snow\n",
      "melted and spring to come, and flowers--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hal Ha! Ha!” taunted Bo. “Nell Rayner, do you see any green in my eyes?\n",
      "Spring to come! Yes, the poet said in the spring a young man's fancy\n",
      "lightly turns to thoughts of love. But that poet meant a young woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed out of the window at the white stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, have you seen him--since I was hurt?” continued Bo, with an\n",
      "effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Him? Who?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, whom do you suppose? I mean Tom!” she responded, and the last word\n",
      "came with a burst.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom? Who's he? Ah, you mean Las Vegas. Yes, I've seen him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, did he ask a-about me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe he did ask how you were--something like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! Nell, I don't always trust you.” After that she relapsed into\n",
      "silence, read awhile, and dreamed awhile, looking into the fire, and\n",
      "then she limped over to kiss Helen good night and left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day she was rather quiet, seeming upon the verge of one of the\n",
      "dispirited spells she got infrequently. Early in the evening, just after\n",
      "the lights had been lit and she had joined Helen in the sitting-room, a\n",
      "familiar step sounded on the loose boards of the porch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen went to the door to admit Carmichael. He was clean-shaven,\n",
      "dressed in his dark suit, which presented such marked contrast from\n",
      "his riding-garb, and he wore a flower in his buttonhole. Nevertheless,\n",
      "despite all this style, he seemed more than usually the cool, easy,\n",
      "careless cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Evenin', Miss Helen,” he said, as he stalked in. “Evenin', Miss Bo. How\n",
      "are you-all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen returned his greeting with a welcoming smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good evening--TOM,” said Bo, demurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "That assuredly was the first time she had ever called him Tom. As she\n",
      "spoke she looked distractingly pretty and tantalizing. But if she had\n",
      "calculated to floor Carmichael with the initial, half-promising, wholly\n",
      "mocking use of his name she had reckoned without cause. The cowboy\n",
      "received that greeting as if he had heard her use it a thousand times\n",
      "or had not heard it at all. Helen decided if he was acting a part he\n",
      "was certainly a clever actor. He puzzled her somewhat, but she liked his\n",
      "look, and his easy manner, and the something about him that must have\n",
      "been his unconscious sense of pride. He had gone far enough, perhaps too\n",
      "far, in his overtures to Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you feelin'?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm better to-day,” she replied, with downcast eyes. “But I'm lame\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon that bronc piled you up. Miss Helen said there shore wasn't any\n",

      "hurt, if he has to keep on ridin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I'll be well soon. How's Sam? I hope he wasn't crippled.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Tom--I--I want to thank you for giving Riggs what he deserved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke it earnestly, eloquently, and for once she had no sly little\n",
      "intonation or pert allurement, such as was her wont to use on this\n",
      "infatuated young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, you heard about that,” replied Carmichael, with a wave of his hand\n",
      "to make light of it. “Nothin' much. It had to be done. An' shore I was\n",
      "afraid of Roy. He'd been bad. An' so would any of the other boys. I'm\n",
      "sorta lookin' out for all of them, you know, actin' as Miss Helen's\n",
      "foreman now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was unutterably tickled. The effect of his speech upon Bo was\n",
      "stupendous. He had disarmed her. He had, with the finesse and tact\n",
      "and suavity of a diplomat, removed himself from obligation, and the\n",
      "detachment of self, the casual thing be apparently made out of his\n",
      "magnificent championship, was bewildering and humiliating to Bo. She\n",
      "sat silent for a moment or two while Helen tried to fit easily into\n",
      "the conversation. It was not likely that Bo would long be at a loss\n",
      "for words, and also it was immensely probable that with a flash of her\n",
      "wonderful spirit she would turn the tables on her perverse lover in a\n",
      "twinkling. Anyway, plain it was that a lesson had sunk deep. She looked\n",
      "startled, hurt, wistful, and finally sweetly defiant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But--you told Riggs I was your girl!” Thus Bo unmasked her battery. And\n",
      "Helen could not imagine how Carmichael would ever resist that and the\n",
      "soft, arch glance which accompanied it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen did not yet know the cowboy, any more than did Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. I had to say thet. I had to make it strong before thet gang. I\n",
      "reckon it was presumin' of me, an' I shore apologize.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo stared at him, and then, giving a little gasp, she drooped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I just run in to say howdy an' to inquire after you-all,” said\n",
      "Carmichael. “I'm goin' to the dance, an' as Flo lives out of town a ways\n",

      "\n",
      "Bo roused to a very friendly and laconic little speech, much overdone.\n",

      "after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant he had departed Bo's transformation was tragic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Flo! He meant Flo Stubbs--that ugly, cross-eyed, bold, little frump!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo!” expostulated Helen. “The young lady is not beautiful, I grant, but\n",
      "she's very nice and pleasant. I liked her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell Rayner, men are no good! And cowboys are the worst!” declared Bo,\n",
      "terribly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why didn't you appreciate Tom when you had him?” asked Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had been growing furious, but now the allusion, in past tense, to\n",
      "the conquest she had suddenly and amazingly found dear quite broke her\n",
      "spirit. It was a very pale, unsteady, and miserable girl who avoided\n",
      "Helen's gaze and left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Bo was not approachable from any direction. Helen found her\n",
      "a victim to a multiplicity of moods, ranging from woe to dire, dark\n",
      "broodings, from them to' wistfulness, and at last to a pride that\n",
      "sustained her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in the afternoon, at Helen's leisure hour, when she and Bo were in\n",
      "the sitting-room, horses tramped into the court and footsteps mounted\n",
      "the porch. Opening to a loud knock, Helen was surprised to see Beasley.\n",
      "And out in the court were several mounted horsemen. Helen's heart sank.\n",
      "This visit, indeed, had been foreshadowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afternoon, Miss Rayner,” said Beasley, doffing his sombrero. “I've\n",
      "called on a little business deal. Will you see me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen acknowledged his greeting while she thought rapidly. She might\n",
      "just as well see him and have that inevitable interview done with.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come in,” she said, and when he had entered she closed the door. “My\n",
      "sister, Mr. Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How d' you do, Miss?” said the rancher, in bluff, loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo acknowledged the introduction with a frigid little bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "At close range Beasley seemed a forceful personality as well as a rather\n",
      "handsome man of perhaps thirty-five, heavy of build, swarthy of skin,\n",
      "and sloe-black of eye, like that of the Mexicans whose blood was\n",
      "reported to be in him. He looked crafty, confident, and self-centered.\n",
      "If Helen had never heard of him before that visit she would have\n",
      "distrusted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd called sooner, but I was waitin' for old Jose, the Mexican who\n",
      "herded for me when I was pardner to your uncle,” said Beasley, and he\n",
      "sat down to put his huge gloved hands on his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes?” queried Helen, interrogatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jose rustled over from Magdalena, an' now I can back up my claim....\n",
      "Miss Rayner, this hyar ranch ought to be mine an' is mine. It wasn't so\n",
      "big or so well stocked when Al Auchincloss beat me out of it. I reckon\n",
      "I'll allow for thet. I've papers, an' old Jose for witness. An' I\n",
      "calculate you'll pay me eighty thousand dollars, or else I'll take over\n",
      "the ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley spoke in an ordinary, matter-of-fact tone that certainly seemed\n",
      "sincere, and his manner was blunt, but perfectly natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Beasley, your claim is no news to me,” responded Helen, quietly.\n",
      "“I've heard about it. And I questioned my uncle. He swore on his\n",
      "death-bed that he did not owe you a dollar. Indeed, he claimed the\n",
      "indebtedness was yours to him. I could find nothing in his papers, so I\n",
      "must repudiate your claim. I will not take it seriously.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Rayner, I can't blame you for takin' Al's word against mine,” said\n",
      "Beasley. “An' your stand is natural. But you're a stranger here an' you\n",
      "know nothin' of stock deals in these ranges. It ain't fair to speak\n",
      "bad of the dead, but the truth is thet Al Auchincloss got his start by\n",
      "stealin' sheep an' unbranded cattle. Thet was the start of every rancher\n",
      "I know. It was mine. An' we none of us ever thought of it as rustlin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could only stare her surprise and doubt at this statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talk's cheap anywhere, an' in the West talk ain't much at all,”\n",
      " continued Beasley. “I'm no talker. I jest want to tell my case an' make\n",
      "a deal if you'll have it. I can prove more in black an' white, an' with\n",
      "witness, than you can. Thet's my case. The deal I'd make is this....\n",
      "Let's marry an' settle a bad deal thet way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man's direct assumption, absolutely without a qualifying\n",
      "consideration for her woman's attitude, was amazing, ignorant, and base;\n",
      "but Helen was so well prepared for it that she hid her disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Mr. Beasley, but I can't accept your offer,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you take time an' consider?” he asked, spreading wide his huge\n",
      "gloved hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Absolutely no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley rose to his feet. He showed no disappointment or chagrin, but\n",
      "the bold pleasantness left his face, and, slight as that change was, it\n",
      "stripped him of the only redeeming quality he showed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet means I'll force you to pay me the eighty thousand or put you\n",
      "off,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Beasley, even if I owed you that, how could I raise so enormous a\n",
      "sum? I don't owe it. And I certainly won't be put off my property. You\n",
      "can't put me off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' why can't I?” he demanded, with lowering, dark gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because your claim is dishonest. And I can prove it,” declared Helen,\n",
      "forcibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who 're you goin' to prove it to--thet I'm dishonest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To my men--to your men--to the people of Pine--to everybody. There's\n",
      "not a person who won't believe me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed curious, discomfited, surlily annoyed, and yet fascinated\n",
      "by her statement or else by the quality and appearance of her as she\n",
      "spiritedly defended her cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' how 're you goin' to prove all thet?” he growled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Beasley, do you remember last fall when you met Snake Anson with\n",
      "his gang up in the woods--and hired him to make off with me?” asked\n",
      "Helen, in swift, ringing words.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark olive of Beasley's bold face shaded to a dirty white.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wha-at?” he jerked out, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see you remember. Well, Milt Dale was hidden in the loft of that\n",
      "cabin where you met Anson. He heard every word of your deal with the\n",
      "outlaw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley swung his arm in sudden violence, so hard that he flung his\n",
      "glove to the floor. As he stooped to snatch it up he uttered a sibilant\n",
      "hiss. Then, stalking to the door, he jerked it open, and slammed it\n",
      "behind him. His loud voice, hoarse with passion, preceded the scrape and\n",
      "crack of hoofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after supper that day, when Helen was just recovering her\n",
      "composure, Carmichael presented himself at the open door. Bo was not\n",
      "there. In the dimming twilight Helen saw that the cowboy was pale,\n",
      "somber, grim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, what's happened?” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy's been shot. It come off in Turner's saloon But he ain't dead. We\n",
      "packed him over to Widow Cass's. An' he said for me to tell you he'd\n",
      "pull through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shot! Pull through!” repeated Helen, in slow, unrealizing exclamation.\n",
      "She was conscious of a deep internal tumult and a cold checking of blood\n",
      "in all her external body.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, shot,” replied Carmichael, fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An', whatever he says, I reckon he won't pull through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Heaven, how terrible!” burst out Helen. “He was so good--such a\n",
      "man! What a pity! Oh, he must have met that in my behalf. Tell me, what\n",
      "happened? Who shot him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I don't know. An' thet's what's made me hoppin' mad. I wasn't\n",
      "there when it come off. An' he won't tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't know thet, either. I reckoned first it was because he wanted\n",
      "to get even. But, after thinkin' it over, I guess he doesn't want me\n",
      "lookin' up any one right now for fear I might get hurt. An' you're goin'\n",
      "to need your friends. Thet's all I can make of Roy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen hurriedly related the event of Beasley's call on her that\n",
      "afternoon and all that had occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, the half-breed son-of-a-greaser!” ejaculated Carmichael, in utter\n",
      "confoundment. “He wanted you to marry him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He certainly did. I must say it was a--a rather abrupt proposal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael appeared to be laboring with speech that had to be smothered\n",
      "behind his teeth. At last he let out an explosive breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, I've shore felt in my bones thet I'm the boy slated to brand\n",
      "thet big bull.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he must have shot Roy. He left here in a rage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you can coax it out of Roy. Fact is, all I could learn was\n",
      "thet Roy come in the saloon alone. Beasley was there, an' Riggs--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs!” interrupted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, Riggs. He come back again. But he'd better keep out of my\n",
      "way.... An' Jeff Mulvey with his outfit. Turner told me he heard an\n",
      "argument an' then a shot. The gang cleared out, leavin' Roy on the\n",
      "floor. I come in a little later. Roy was still layin' there. Nobody was\n",
      "doin' anythin' for him. An' nobody had. I hold that against Turner. Wal,\n",
      "I got help an' packed Roy over to Widow Cass's. Roy seemed all right.\n",
      "But he was too bright an' talky to suit me. The bullet hit his lung,\n",
      "thet's shore. An' he lost a sight of blood before we stopped it. Thet\n",
      "skunk Turner might have lent a hand. An' if Roy croaks I reckon I'll--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, why must you always be reckoning to kill somebody?” demanded\n",
      "Helen, angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Cause somebody's got to be killed 'round here. Thet's why!” he snapped\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even so--should you risk leaving Bo and me without a friend?” asked\n",
      "Helen, reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that Carmichael wavered and lost something of his sullen deadliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Miss Nell, I'm only mad. If you'll just be patient with me--an'\n",
      "mebbe coax me.... But I can't see no other way out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's hope and pray,” said Helen, earnestly. “You spoke of my coaxing\n",
      "Roy to tell who shot him. When can I see him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To-morrow, I reckon. I'll come for you. Fetch Bo along with you. We've\n",
      "got to play safe from now on. An' what do you say to me an' Hal sleepin'\n",
      "here at the ranch-house?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I'd feel safer,” she replied. “There are rooms. Please come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Allright. An' now I'll be goin' to fetch Hal. Shore wish I hadn't made\n",
      "you pale an' scared like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "About ten o'clock next morning Carmichael drove Helen and Bo into Pine,\n",
      "and tied up the team before Widow Cass's cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peach and apple-trees were mingling blossoms of pink and white; a\n",
      "drowsy hum of bees filled the fragrant air; rich, dark-green alfalfa\n",
      "covered the small orchard flat; a wood fire sent up a lazy column of\n",

      "as short. Beasley's thick-headed, an' powerful conceited. Vain as a\n",

      "CHAPTER XIX\n",
      "\n",
      "The memory of a woman had ruined Milt Dale's peace, had confounded his\n",
      "philosophy of self-sufficient, lonely happiness in the solitude of the\n",
      "wilds, had forced him to come face to face with his soul and the fatal\n",
      "significance of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he realized his defeat, that things were not as they seemed, that\n",
      "there was no joy for him in the coming of spring, that he had been blind\n",
      "in his free, sensorial, Indian relation to existence, he fell into\n",
      "an inexplicably strange state, a despondency, a gloom as deep as the\n",
      "silence of his home. Dale reflected that the stronger an animal, the\n",
      "keener its nerves, the higher its intelligence, the greater must be its\n",
      "suffering under restraint or injury. He thought of himself as a high\n",
      "order of animal whose great physical need was action, and now the\n",
      "incentive to action seemed dead. He grew lax. He did not want to move.\n",
      "He performed his diminishing duties under compulsion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched for spring as a liberation, but not that he could leave the\n",
      "valley. He hated the cold, he grew weary of wind and snow; he imagined\n",
      "the warm sun, the park once more green with grass and bright with\n",
      "daisies, the return of birds and squirrels and deer to heir old haunts,\n",
      "would be the means whereby he could break this spell upon him. Then he\n",
      "might gradually return to past contentment, though it would never be the\n",
      "same.\n",
      "\n",
      "But spring, coming early to Paradise Park, brought a fever to Dale's\n",
      "blood--a fire of unutterable longing. It was good, perhaps, that\n",
      "this was so, because he seemed driven to work, climb, tramp, and keep\n",
      "ceaselessly on the move from dawn till dark. Action strengthened his lax\n",
      "muscles and kept him from those motionless, senseless hours of brooding.\n",
      "He at least need not be ashamed of longing for that which could never\n",
      "be his--the sweetness of a woman--a home full of light, joy, hope, the\n",
      "meaning and beauty of children. But those dark moods were sinkings into\n",
      "a pit of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had not kept track of days and weeks. He did not know when the snow\n",
      "melted off three slopes of Paradise Park. All he knew was that an age\n",
      "had dragged over his head and that spring had come. During his restless\n",
      "waking hours, and even when he was asleep, there seemed always in the\n",
      "back of his mind a growing consciousness that soon he would emerge from\n",
      "this trial, a changed man, ready to sacrifice his chosen lot, to give up\n",
      "his lonely life of selfish indulgence in lazy affinity with nature,\n",
      "and to go wherever his strong hands might perform some real service\n",
      "to people. Nevertheless, he wanted to linger in this mountain fastness\n",
      "until his ordeal was over--until he could meet her, and the world,\n",
      "knowing himself more of a man than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "One bright morning, while he was at his camp-fire, the tame cougar gave\n",
      "a low, growling warning. Dale was startled. Tom did not act like that\n",
      "because of a prowling grizzly or a straying stag. Presently Dale espied\n",
      "a horseman riding slowly out of the straggling spruces. And with that\n",
      "sight Dale's heart gave a leap, recalling to him a divination of his\n",
      "future relation to his kind. Never had he been so glad to see a man!\n",
      "\n",
      "This visitor resembled one of the Beemans, judging from the way he sat\n",
      "his horse, and presently Dale recognized him to be John.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture the jaded horse was spurred into a trot, soon reaching\n",
      "the pines and the camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, there, you ole b'ar-hunter!” called John, waving his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all his hearty greeting his appearance checked a like response from\n",
      "Dale. The horse was mud to his flanks and John was mud to his knees,\n",
      "wet, bedraggled, worn, and white. This hue of his face meant more than\n",
      "fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, John?” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "They shook hands. John wearily swung his leg over the pommel, but did\n",
      "not at once dismount. His clear gray eyes were wonderingly riveted upon\n",
      "the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt--what 'n hell's wrong?” he queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bust me if you ain't changed so I hardly knowed you. You've been\n",
      "sick--all alone here!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do I look sick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I should smile. Thin an' pale an' down in the mouth! Milt, what\n",

      "\n",

      "overdid it, Milt. An' you look sick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, my sickness is here,” replied Dale, soberly, as he laid a hand on\n",
      "his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lung trouble!” ejaculated John. “With thet chest, an' up in this\n",
      "air?... Get out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No--not lung trouble,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I savvy. Had a hunch from Roy, anyhow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind of a hunch?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Easy now, Dale, ole man.... Don't you reckon I'm ridin' in on you\n",
      "pretty early? Look at thet hoss!” John slid off and waved a hand at\n",
      "the drooping beast, then began to unsaddle him. “Wal, he done great. We\n",
      "bogged some comin' over. An' I climbed the pass at night on the frozen\n",
      "snow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're welcome as the flowers in May. John, what month is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By spades! are you as bad as thet?... Let's see. It's the twenty-third\n",
      "of March.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“March! Well, I'm beat. I've lost my reckonin'--an' a lot more, maybe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thar!” declared John, slapping the mustang. “You can jest hang up here\n",
      "till my next trip. Milt, how 're your hosses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wintered fine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet's good. We'll need two big, strong hosses right off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” queried Dale, sharply. He dropped a stick of wood and\n",
      "straightened up from the camp-fire.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Familiarly then came back to Dale the quiet, intent suggestiveness of\n",
      "the Beemans in moments foreboding trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this certain assurance of John's, too significant to be doubted,\n",
      "Dale's thought of Pine gave slow birth to a strange sensation, as if he\n",
      "had been dead and was vibrating back to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell what you got to tell!” he broke out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick as a flash the Mormon replied: “Roy's been shot. But he won't die.\n",
      "He sent for you. Bad deal's afoot. Beasley means to force Helen Rayner\n",
      "out an' steal her ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A tremor ran all through Dale. It seemed another painful yet thrilling\n",
      "connection between his past and this vaguely calling future. His\n",
      "emotions had been broodings dreams, longings. This thing his friend said\n",
      "had the sting of real life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then old Al's dead?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Long ago--I reckon around the middle of February. The property went to\n",
      "Helen. She's been doin' fine. An' many folks say it's a pity she'll lose\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She won't lose it,” declared Dale. How strange his voice sounded to his\n",
      "own ears! It was hoarse and unreal, as if from disuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, we-all have our idees. I say she will. My father says so.\n",
      "Carmichael says so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you remember thet cow-puncher who came up with Roy an'\n",
      "Auchincloss after the girls--last fall?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. They called him Las--Las Vegas. I liked his looks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! You'll like him a heap when you know him. He's kept the ranch\n",
      "goin' for Miss Helen all along. But the deal's comin' to a head.\n",
      "Beasley's got thick with thet Riggs. You remember him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, he's been hangin' out at Pine all winter, watchin' for some chance\n",
      "to get at Miss Helen or Bo. Everybody's seen thet. An' jest lately he\n",
      "chased Bo on hossback--gave the kid a nasty fall. Roy says Riggs was\n",
      "after Miss Helen. But I think one or t'other of the girls would do thet\n",
      "varmint. Wal, thet sorta started goin's-on. Carmichael beat Riggs an'\n",
      "drove him out of town. But he come back. Beasley called on Miss Helen\n",
      "an' offered to marry her so's not to take the ranch from her, he said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale awoke with a thundering curse.\n",

      "“Shore!” exclaimed John. “I'd say the same--only I'm religious. Don't\n",
      "thet beady-eyed greaser's gall make you want to spit all over yourself?\n",
      "My Gawd! but Roy was mad! Roy's powerful fond of Miss Helen an' Bo....\n",
      "Wal, then, Roy, first chance he got, braced Beasley an' give him some\n",
      "straight talk. Beasley was foamin' at the mouth, Roy said. It was then\n",
      "Riggs shot Roy. Shot him from behind Beasley when Roy wasn't lookin'!\n",
      "An' Riggs brags of bein' a gun-fighter. Mebbe thet wasn't a bad shot for\n",
      "him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon,” replied Dale, as he swallowed hard. “Now, just what was\n",
      "Roy's message to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I can't remember all Roy said,” answered John, dubiously. “But\n",
      "Roy shore was excited an' dead in earnest. He says: 'Tell Milt what's\n",
      "happened. Tell him Helen Rayner's in more danger than she was last fall.\n",
      "Tell him I've seen her look away acrost the mountains toward Paradise\n",
      "Park with her heart in her eyes. Tell him she needs him most of all!'”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook all over as with an attack of ague. He was seized by a\n",
      "whirlwind of passionate, terrible sweetness of sensation, when what\n",
      "he wildly wanted was to curse Roy and John for their simple-minded\n",
      "conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy's--crazy!” panted Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, now, Milt--thet's downright surprisin' of you. Roy's the\n",
      "level-headest of any fellars I know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man! if he MADE me believe him--an' it turned out untrue--I'd--I'd kill\n",
      "him,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Untrue! Do you think Roy Beeman would lie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, John--you fellows can't see my case. Nell Rayner wants me--needs\n",
      "me!... It can't be true!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, my love-sick pard--it jest IS true!” exclaimed John, feelingly.\n",
      "“Thet's the hell of life--never knowin'. But here it's joy for you. You\n",
      "can believe Roy Beeman about women as quick as you'd trust him to track\n",
      "your lost hoss. Roy's married three girls. I reckon he'll marry some\n",
      "more. Roy's only twenty-eight an' he has two big farms. He said he'd\n",
      "seen Nell Rayner's heart in her eyes, lookin' for you--an' you can jest\n",
      "bet your life thet's true. An' he said it because he means you to rustle\n",
      "down there an' fight for thet girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll--go,” said Dale, in a shaky whisper, as he sat down on a pine log\n",
      "near the fire. He stared unseeingly at the bluebells in the grass by his\n",
      "feet while storm after storm possessed his breast. They were fierce and\n",
      "brief because driven by his will. In those few moments of contending\n",
      "strife Dale was immeasurably removed from that dark gulf of self which\n",
      "had made his winter a nightmare. And when he stood erect again it seemed\n",
      "that the old earth had a stirring, electrifying impetus for his feet.\n",
      "Something black, bitter, melancholy, and morbid, always unreal to him,\n",
      "had passed away forever. The great moment had been forced upon him. He\n",
      "did not believe Roy Beeman's preposterous hint regarding Helen; but he\n",
      "had gone back or soared onward, as if by magic, to his old true self.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mounted on Dale's strongest horses, with only a light pack, an ax, and\n",
      "their weapons, the two men had reached the snow-line on the pass by noon\n",
      "that day. Tom, the tame cougar, trotted along in the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crust of the snow, now half thawed by the sun, would not hold\n",
      "the weight of a horse, though it upheld the men on foot. They walked,\n",
      "leading the horses. Travel was not difficult until the snow began to\n",
      "deepen; then progress slackened materially. John had not been able to\n",
      "pick out the line of the trail, so Dale did not follow his tracks. An\n",
      "old blaze on the trees enabled Dale to keep fairly well to the trail;\n",
      "and at length the height of the pass was reached, where the snow was\n",
      "deep. Here the horses labored, plowing through foot by foot. When,\n",
      "finally, they sank to their flanks, they had to be dragged and goaded\n",
      "on, and helped by thick flat bunches of spruce boughs placed under their\n",
      "hoofs. It took three hours of breaking toil to do the few hundred yards\n",
      "of deep snow on the height of the pass. The cougar did not have great\n",
      "difficulty in following, though it was evident he did not like such\n",
      "traveling.\n",
      "\n",
      "That behind them, the horses gathered heart and worked on to the edge\n",
      "of the steep descent, where they had all they could do to hold back from\n",
      "sliding and rolling. Fast time was made on this slope, at the bottom of\n",
      "which began a dense forest with snow still deep in places and windfalls\n",
      "hard to locate. The men here performed Herculean labors, but they got\n",
      "through to a park where the snow was gone. The ground, however, soft and\n",
      "boggy, in places was more treacherous than the snow; and the travelers\n",
      "had to skirt the edge of the park to a point opposite, and then go on\n",
      "through the forest. When they reached bare and solid ground, just before\n",
      "dark that night, it was high time, for the horses were ready to drop,\n",
      "and the men likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Camp was made in an open wood. Darkness fell and the men were resting\n",
      "on bough beds, feet to the fire, with Tom curled up close by, and the\n",
      "horses still drooping where they had been unsaddled. Morning, however,\n",
      "discovered them grazing on the long, bleached grass. John shook his head\n",
      "when he looked at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You reckoned to make Pine by nightfall. How far is it--the way you'll\n",
      "go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fifty mile or thereabouts,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, we can't ride it on them critters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, we'd do more than that if we had to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were saddled and on the move before sunrise, leaving snow and bog\n",
      "behind. Level parks and level forests led one after another to long\n",
      "slopes and steep descents, all growing sunnier and greener as the\n",
      "altitude diminished. Squirrels and grouse, turkeys and deer, and less\n",
      "tame denizens of the forest grew more abundant as the travel advanced.\n",
      "In this game zone, however, Dale had trouble with Tom. The cougar had to\n",
      "be watched and called often to keep him off of trails.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom doesn't like a long trip,” said Dale. “But I'm goin' to take him.\n",
      "Some way or other he may come in handy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sic him onto Beasley's gang,” replied John. “Some men are powerful\n",
      "scared of cougars. But I never was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor me. Though I've had cougars give me a darn uncanny feelin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The men talked but little. Dale led the way, with Tom trotting\n",
      "noiselessly beside his horse. John followed close behind. They loped the\n",
      "horses across parks, trotted through the forests, walked slow up\n",
      "what few inclines they met, and slid down the soft, wet, pine-matted\n",
      "descents. So they averaged from six to eight miles an hour. The horses\n",
      "held up well under that steady travel, and this without any rest at\n",
      "noon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale seemed to feel himself in an emotional trance. Yet, despite this,\n",
      "the same old sensorial perceptions crowded thick and fast upon him,\n",
      "strangely sweet and vivid after the past dead months when neither sun\n",
      "nor wind nor cloud nor scent of pine nor anything in nature could stir\n",
      "him. His mind, his heart, his soul seemed steeped in an intoxicating\n",
      "wine of expectation, while his eyes and ears and nose had never been\n",
      "keener to register the facts of the forest-land. He saw the black thing\n",
      "far ahead that resembled a burned stump, but he knew was a bear before\n",
      "it vanished; he saw gray flash of deer and wolf and coyote, and the red\n",
      "of fox, and the small, wary heads of old gobblers just sticking above\n",
      "the grass; and he saw deep tracks of game as well as the slow-rising\n",
      "blades of bluebells where some soft-footed beast had just trod. And he\n",
      "heard the melancholy notes of birds, the twitter of grouse, the sough of\n",
      "the wind, the light dropping of pine-cones, the near and distant bark of\n",
      "squirrels, the deep gobble of a turkey close at hand and the challenge\n",
      "from a rival far away, the cracking of twigs in the thickets, the murmur\n",
      "of running water, the scream of an eagle and the shrill cry of a hawk,\n",
      "and always the soft, dull, steady pads of the hoofs of the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smells, too, were the sweet, stinging ones of spring, warm and\n",
      "pleasant--the odor of the clean, fresh earth cutting its way through\n",
      "that thick, strong fragrance of pine, the smell of logs rotting in the\n",
      "sun, and of fresh new grass and flowers along a brook of snow-water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I smell smoke,” said Dale, suddenly, as he reined in, and turned for\n",
      "corroboration from his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "John sniffed the warm air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you're more of an Injun than me,” he replied, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "They traveled on, and presently came out upon the rim of the last slope.\n",
      "A long league of green slanted below them, breaking up into straggling\n",
      "lines of trees and groves that joined the cedars, and these in turn\n",
      "stretched on and down in gray-black patches to the desert, that\n",
      "glittering and bare, with streaks of somber hue, faded in the obscurity\n",
      "of distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of Pine appeared to nestle in a curve of the edge of the\n",
      "great forest, and the cabins looked like tiny white dots set in green.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look there,” said Dale, pointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some miles to the right a gray escarpment of rock cropped out of the\n",
      "slope, forming a promontory; and from it a thin, pale column of smoke\n",
      "curled upward to be lost from sight as soon as it had no background of\n",
      "green.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's your smoke, shore enough,” replied John, thoughtfully. “Now, I\n",
      "jest wonder who's campin' there. No water near or grass for hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, that point's been used for smoke signals many a time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was jest thinkin' of thet same. Shall we ride around there an' take a\n",
      "peek?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But we'll remember that. If Beasley's got his deep scheme goin',\n",
      "he'll have Snake Anson's gang somewhere close.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy said thet same. Wal, it's some three hours till sundown. The hosses\n",
      "keep up. I reckon I'm fooled, for we'll make Pine all right. But old Tom\n",
      "there, he's tired or lazy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The big cougar was lying down, panting, and his half-shut eyes were on\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom's only lazy an' fat. He could travel at this gait for a week. But\n",
      "let's rest a half-hour an' watch that smoke before movin' on. We can\n",
      "make Pine before sundown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When travel had been resumed, half-way down the slope Dale's sharp eyes\n",
      "caught a broad track where shod horses had passed, climbing in a long\n",
      "slant toward the promontory. He dismounted to examine it, and John,\n",
      "coming up, proceeded with alacrity to get off and do likewise. Dale made\n",
      "his deductions, after which he stood in a brown study beside his horse,\n",
      "waiting for John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, what 'd you make of these here tracks?” asked that worthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some horses an' a pony went along here yesterday, an' to-day a single\n",
      "horse made, that fresh track.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt, for a hunter you ain't so bad at hoss tracks,” observed\n",
      "John, “But how many hosses went yesterday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn't make out--several--maybe four or five.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Six hosses an' a colt or little mustang, unshod, to be strict-correct.\n",
      "Wal, supposin' they did. What 's it mean to us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't know as I'd thought anythin' unusual, if it hadn't been for\n",
      "that smoke we saw off the rim, an' then this here fresh track made along\n",
      "to-day. Looks queer to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wish Roy was here,” replied John, scratching his head. “Milt, I've a\n",
      "hunch, if he was, he'd foller them tracks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe. But we haven't time for that. We can backtrail them, though, if\n",
      "they keep clear as they are here. An' we'll not lose any time, either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That broad track led straight toward Pine, down to the edge of the\n",
      "cedars, where, amid some jagged rocks, evidences showed that men had\n",
      "camped there for days. Here it ended as a broad trail. But from the\n",
      "north came the single fresh track made that very day, and from the east,\n",
      "more in a line with Pine, came two tracks made the day before. And these\n",
      "were imprints of big and little hoofs. Manifestly these interested John\n",
      "more than they did Dale, who had to wait for his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, it ain't a colt's--thet little track,” avowed John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not--an' what if it isn't?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, it ain't, because a colt always straggles back, an' from one\n",
      "side to t'other. This little track keeps close to the big one. An', by\n",
      "George! it was made by a led mustang.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John resembled Roy Beeman then with that leaping, intent fire in his\n",
      "gray eyes. Dale's reply was to spur his horse into a trot and call\n",
      "sharply to the lagging cougar.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they turned into the broad, blossom-bordered road that was the\n",
      "only thoroughfare of Pine the sun was setting red and gold behind the\n",
      "mountains. The horses were too tired for any more than a walk. Natives\n",
      "of the village, catching sight of Dale and Beeman, and the huge gray cat\n",
      "following like a dog, called excitedly to one another. A group of men\n",
      "in front of Turner's gazed intently down the road, and soon manifested\n",
      "signs of excitement. Dale and his comrade dismounted in front of Widow\n",
      "Cass's cottage. And Dale called as he strode up the little path. Mrs.\n",
      "Cass came out. She was white and shaking, but appeared calm. At sight of\n",
      "her John Beeman drew a sharp breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, now--” he began, hoarsely, and left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How's Roy?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord knows I'm glad to see you, boys! Milt, you're thin an'\n",
      "strange-lookin'. Roy's had a little setback. He got a shock to-day an'\n",
      "it throwed him off. Fever--an' now he's out of his head. It won't do\n",
      "no good for you to waste time seein' him. Take my word for it he's\n",
      "all right. But there's others as--For the land's sakes, Milt Dale, you\n",
      "fetched thet cougar back! Don't let him near me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom won't hurt you, mother,” said Dale, as the cougar came padding up\n",
      "the path. “You were sayin' somethin'--about others. Is Miss Helen safe?\n",
      "Hurry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride up to see her--an' waste no more time here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale was quick in the saddle, followed by John, but the horses had to be\n",
      "severely punished to force them even to a trot. And that was a lagging\n",
      "trot, which now did not leave Torn behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ride up to Auchincloss's ranch-house seemed endless to Dale. Natives\n",
      "came out in the road to watch after he had passed. Stern as Dale was in\n",
      "dominating his feelings, he could not wholly subordinate his mounting\n",
      "joy to a waiting terrible anticipation of catastrophe. But no matter\n",
      "what awaited--nor what fateful events might hinge upon this nameless\n",
      "circumstance about to be disclosed, the wonderful and glorious fact of\n",
      "the present was that in a moment he would see Helen Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were saddled horses in the courtyard, but no riders. A Mexican\n",
      "boy sat on the porch bench, in the seat where Dale remembered he had\n",
      "encountered Al Auchincloss. The door of the big sitting-room was open.\n",
      "The scent of flowers, the murmur of bees, the pounding of hoofs came\n",
      "vaguely to Dale. His eyes dimmed, so that the ground, when he slid out\n",
      "of his saddle, seemed far below him. He stepped upon the porch. His\n",
      "sight suddenly cleared. A tight fullness at his throat made incoherent\n",
      "the words he said to the Mexican boy. But they were understood, as the\n",
      "boy ran back around the house. Dale knocked sharply and stepped over the\n",
      "threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, John, true to his habits, was thinking, even in that moment of\n",
      "suspense, about the faithful, exhausted horses. As he unsaddled them he\n",
      "talked: “Fer soft an' fat hosses, winterin' high up, wal, you've done\n",
      "somethin'!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dale heard a voice in another room, a step, a creak of the door. It\n",
      "opened. A woman in white appeared. He recognized Helen. But instead of\n",
      "the rich brown bloom and dark-eyed beauty so hauntingly limned on\n",
      "his memory, he saw a white, beautiful face, strained and quivering in\n",
      "anguish, and eyes that pierced his heart. He could not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! my friend--you've come!” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale put out a shaking hand. But she did not see it. She clutched his\n",
      "shoulders, as if to feel whether or not he was real, and then her arms\n",
      "went up round his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, thank God! I knew you would come!” she said, and her head sank to\n",
      "his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale divined what he had suspected. Helen's sister had been carried off.\n",
      "Yet, while his quick mind grasped Helen's broken spirit--the unbalance\n",
      "that was reason for this marvelous and glorious act--he did not\n",
      "take other meaning of the embrace to himself. He just stood there,\n",
      "transported, charged like a tree struck by lightning, making sure with\n",
      "all his keen senses, so that he could feel forever, how she was clinging\n",
      "round his neck, her face over his bursting heart, her quivering form\n",
      "close pressed to his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's--Bo,” he said, unsteadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She went riding yesterday--and--never--came--back!” replied Helen,\n",
      "brokenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've seen her trail. She's been taken into the woods. I'll find her.\n",
      "I'll fetch her back,” he replied, rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a shock she seemed to absorb his meaning. With another shock she\n",
      "raised her face--leaned back a little to look at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll find her--fetch her back?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he answered, instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that ringing word it seemed to Dale she realized how she was\n",
      "standing. He felt her shake as she dropped her arms and stepped back,\n",
      "while the white anguish of her face was flooded out by a wave of\n",
      "scarlet. But she was brave in her confusion. Her eyes never fell, though\n",
      "they changed swiftly, darkening with shame, amaze, and with feelings he\n",
      "could not read.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm almost--out of my head,” she faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No wonder. I saw that.... But now you must get clear-headed. I've no\n",
      "time to lose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He led her to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, it's Bo that's gone,” he called. “Since yesterday.... Send the\n",
      "boy to get me a bag of meat an' bread. You run to the corral an' get\n",
      "me a fresh horse. My old horse Ranger if you can find him quick. An'\n",
      "rustle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a word John leaped bareback on one of the horses he had just\n",
      "unsaddled and spurred him across the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the big cougar, seeing Helen, got up from where he lay on the porch\n",
      "and came to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it's Tom!” cried Helen, and as he rubbed against her knees she\n",
      "patted his head with trembling hand. “You big, beautiful pet! Oh, how I\n",
      "remember! Oh, how Bo would love to--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Carmichael?” interrupted Dale. “Out huntin' Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. It was he who missed her first. He rode everywhere yesterday. Last\n",
      "night when he came back he was wild. I've not seen him to-day. He made\n",
      "all the other men but Hal and Joe stay home on the ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right. An' John must stay, too,” declared Dale. “But it's strange.\n",
      "Carmichael ought to have found the girl's tracks. She was ridin' a\n",
      "pony?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo rode Sam. He's a little bronc, very strong and fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come across his tracks. How'd Carmichael miss them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He didn't. He found them--trailed them all along the north range.\n",
      "That's where he forbade Bo to go. You see, they're in love with each\n",
      "other. They've been at odds. Neither will give in. Bo disobeyed him.\n",
      "There's hard ground off the north range, so he said. He was able to\n",
      "follow her tracks only so far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were there any other tracks along with hers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, I found them 'way southeast of Pine up on the slope of the\n",
      "mountain. There were seven other horses makin' that trail--when we run\n",
      "across it. On the way down we found a camp where men had waited. An'\n",
      "Bo's pony, led by a rider on a big horse, come into that camp from the\n",
      "east--maybe north a little. An' that tells the story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs ran her down--made off with her!” cried Helen, passionately. “Oh,\n",
      "the villain! He had men in waiting. That's Beasley's work. They were\n",
      "after me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may not be just what you said, but that's close enough. An' Bo's\n",
      "in a bad fix. You must face that an' try to bear up under--fears of the\n",
      "worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend! You will save her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll fetch her back, alive or dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dead! Oh, my God!” Helen cried, and closed her eyes an instant, to open\n",
      "them burning black. “But Bo isn't dead. I know that--I feel it. She'll\n",
      "not die very easy. She's a little savage. She has no fear. She'd fight\n",
      "like a tigress for her life. She's strong. You remember how strong. She\n",
      "can stand anything. Unless they murder her outright she'll live--a long\n",
      "time--through any ordeal.... So I beg you, my friend, don't lose an\n",
      "hour--don't ever give up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale trembled under the clasp of her hands. Loosing his own from her\n",
      "clinging hold, he stepped out on the porch. At that moment John appeared\n",
      "on Ranger, coming at a gallop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll never come back without her,” said Dale. “I reckon you can\n",
      "hope--only be prepared. That's all. It's hard. But these damned deals\n",
      "are common out here in the West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose Beasley comes--here!” exclaimed Helen, and again her hand went\n",
      "out toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he does, you refuse to get off,” replied Dale. “But don't let him\n",
      "or his greasers put a dirty hand on you. Should he threaten force--why,\n",
      "pack some clothes--an' your valuables--an' go down to Mrs. Cass's. An'\n",
      "wait till I come back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait--till you--come back!” she faltered, slowly turning white again.\n",
      "Her dark eyes dilated. “Milt--you're like Las Vegas. You'll kill\n",
      "Beasley!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale heard his own laugh, very cold and strange, foreign to his ears. A\n",
      "grim, deadly hate of Beasley vied with the tenderness and pity he felt\n",
      "for this distressed girl. It was a sore trial to see her leaning there\n",
      "against the door--to be compelled to leave her alone. Abruptly be\n",
      "stalked off the porch. Tom followed him. The black horse whinnied his\n",
      "recognition of Dale and snorted at sight of the cougar. Just then the\n",
      "Mexican boy returned with a bag. Dale tied this, with the small pack,\n",
      "behind the saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, you stay here with Miss Helen,” said Dale. “An' if Carmichael\n",
      "comes back, keep him, too! An' to-night, if any one rides into Pine from\n",
      "the way we come, you be sure to spot him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll do thet, Milt,” responded John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale mounted, and, turning for a last word to Helen, he felt the\n",
      "words of cheer halted on his lips as he saw her standing white and\n",
      "broken-hearted, with her hands to her bosom. He could not look twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on there, you Tom,” he called to the cougar. “Reckon on this track\n",
      "you'll pay me for all my trainin' of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my friend!” came Helen's sad voice, almost a whisper to his\n",
      "throbbing ears. “Heaven help you--to save her! I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ranger started and Dale heard no more. He could not look back. His\n",
      "eyes were full of tears and his breast ached. By a tremendous effort he\n",
      "shifted that emotion--called on all the spiritual energy of his being to\n",
      "the duty of this grim task before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not ride down through the village, but skirted the northern\n",
      "border, and worked round to the south, where, coming to the trail he had\n",
      "made an hour past, he headed on it, straight for the slope now darkening\n",
      "in the twilight. The big cougar showed more willingness to return on\n",
      "this trail than he had shown in the coming. Ranger was fresh and wanted\n",
      "to go, but Dale held him in.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cool wind blew down from the mountain with the coming of night.\n",
      "Against the brightening stars Dale saw the promontory lift its bold\n",
      "outline. It was miles away. It haunted him, strangely calling. A night,\n",
      "and perhaps a day, separated him from the gang that held Bo Rayner\n",
      "prisoner. Dale had no plan as yet. He had only a motive as great as the\n",
      "love he bore Helen Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley's evil genius had planned this abduction. Riggs was a tool, a\n",
      "cowardly knave dominated by a stronger will. Snake Anson and his gang\n",
      "had lain in wait at that cedar camp; had made that broad hoof track\n",
      "leading up the mountain. Beasley had been there with them that very day.\n",
      "All this was as assured to Dale as if he had seen the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the matter of Dale's recovering the girl and doing it speedily\n",
      "strung his mental strength to its highest pitch. Many outlines of action\n",
      "flashed through his mind as he rode on, peering keenly through the\n",
      "night, listening with practised ears. All were rejected. And at the\n",
      "outset of every new branching of thought he would gaze down at the\n",
      "gray form of the cougar, long, graceful, heavy, as he padded beside the\n",
      "horse. From the first thought of returning to help Helen Rayner he had\n",
      "conceived an undefined idea of possible value in the qualities of his\n",
      "pet. Tom had performed wonderful feats of trailing, but he had never\n",
      "been tried on men. Dale believed he could make him trail anything, yet\n",
      "he had no proof of this. One fact stood out of all Dale's conjectures,\n",
      "and it was that he had known men, and brave men, to fear cougars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far up on the slope, in a little hollow where water ran and there was\n",
      "a little grass for Ranger to pick, Dale haltered him and made ready to\n",
      "spend the night. He was sparing with his food, giving Tom more than he\n",
      "took himself. Curled close up to Dale, the big cat went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dale lay awake for long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was still, with only a faint moan of wind on this sheltered\n",
      "slope. Dale saw hope in the stars. He did not seem to have promised\n",
      "himself or Helen that he could save her sister, and then her property.\n",
      "He seemed to have stated something unconsciously settled, outside of his\n",
      "thinking. Strange how this certainty was not vague, yet irreconcilable\n",
      "with any plans he created! Behind it, somehow nameless with\n",
      "inconceivable power, surged all his wonderful knowledge of forest, of\n",
      "trails, of scents, of night, of the nature of men lying down to sleep in\n",
      "the dark, lonely woods, of the nature of this great cat that lived its\n",
      "every action in accordance with his will.\n",
      "\n",
      "He grew sleepy, and gradually his mind stilled, with his last conscious\n",
      "thought a portent that he would awaken to accomplish his desperate task.\n",

      "CHAPTER XX\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Burt possessed the keenest eyes of any man in Snake Anson's\n",
      "gang, for which reason he was given the post as lookout from the lofty\n",
      "promontory. His instructions were to keep sharp watch over the open\n",
      "slopes below and to report any sight of a horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cedar fire with green boughs on top of dead wood sent up a long, pale\n",
      "column of smoke. This signal-fire had been kept burning since sunrise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preceding night camp had been made on a level spot in the cedars\n",
      "back of the promontory. But manifestly Anson did not expect to remain\n",
      "there long. For, after breakfast, the packs had been made up and the\n",
      "horses stood saddled and bridled. They were restless and uneasy, tossing\n",
      "bits and fighting flies. The sun, now half-way to meridian, was hot and\n",
      "no breeze blew in that sheltered spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones had ridden off early to fill the water-bags, and had not yet\n",
      "returned. Anson, thinner and scalier and more snakelike than ever,\n",
      "was dealing a greasy, dirty deck of cards, his opponent being the\n",
      "square-shaped, black-visaged Moze. In lieu of money the gamblers wagered\n",
      "with cedar-berries, each of which berries represented a pipeful of\n",
      "tobacco. Jim Wilson brooded under a cedar-tree, his unshaven face a\n",
      "dirty dust-hue, a smoldering fire in his light eyes, a sullen set to his\n",
      "jaw. Every little while he would raise his eyes to glance at Riggs, and\n",
      "it seemed that a quick glance was enough. Riggs paced to and fro in\n",
      "the open, coatless and hatless, his black-broadcloth trousers and\n",
      "embroidered vest dusty and torn. An enormous gun bumped awkwardly in\n",
      "its sheath swinging below his hip. Riggs looked perturbed. His face was\n",
      "sweating freely, yet it was far from red in color. He did not appear to\n",
      "mind the sun or the flies. His eyes were staring, dark, wild, shifting\n",
      "in gaze from everything they encountered. But often that gaze shot back\n",
      "to the captive girl sitting under a cedar some yards from the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo Rayner's little, booted feet were tied together with one end of a\n",
      "lasso and the other end trailed off over the ground. Her hands were\n",
      "free. Her riding-habit was dusty and disordered. Her eyes blazed\n",
      "defiantly out of a small, pale face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, I wouldn't be standing in those cheap boots of yours for\n",
      "a million dollars,” she said, sarcastically. Riggs took no notice of her\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You pack that gun-sheath wrong end out. What have you got the gun for,\n",
      "anyhow?” she added, tauntingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson let out a hoarse laugh and Moze's black visage opened in a\n",
      "huge grin. Jim Wilson seemed to drink in the girl's words. Sullen and\n",
      "somber, he bent his lean head, very still, as if listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'd better shut up,” said Riggs, darkly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not shut up,” declared Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I'll gag you,” he threatened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gag me! Why, you dirty, low-down, two-bit of a bluff!” she exclaimed,\n",
      "hotly, “I'd like to see you try it. I'll tear that long hair of yours\n",
      "right off your head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs advanced toward her with his hands clutching, as if eager to\n",
      "throttle her. The girl leaned forward, her face reddening, her eyes\n",
      "fierce.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You damned little cat!” muttered Riggs, thickly. “I'll gag you--if you\n",
      "don't stop squallin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on. I dare you to lay a hand on me.... Harve Riggs, I'm not the\n",
      "least afraid of you. Can't you savvy that? You're a liar, a four-flush,\n",
      "a sneak! Why, you're not fit to wipe the feet of any of these outlaws.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs took two long strides and bent over her, his teeth protruding in a\n",
      "snarl, and he cuffed her hard on the side of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's head jerked back with the force of the blow, but she uttered no\n",
      "cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you goin' to keep your jaw shut?” he demanded, stridently, and a\n",
      "dark tide of blood surged up into his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should smile I'm not,” retorted Bo, in cool, deliberate anger\n",
      "of opposition. “You've roped me--and you've struck me! Now get a\n",
      "club--stand off there--out of my reach--and beat me! Oh, if I only knew\n",
      "cuss words fit for you--I'd call you them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson had stopped playing cards, and was watching, listening, with\n",
      "half-disgusted, half-amused expression on his serpent-like face. Jim\n",
      "Wilson slowly rose to his feet. If any one had observed him it would\n",
      "have been to note that he now seemed singularly fascinated by this\n",
      "scene, yet all the while absorbed in himself. Once he loosened the\n",
      "neck-band of his blouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs swung his arm more violently at the girl. But she dodged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You dog!” she hissed. “Oh, if I only had a gun!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face then, with its dead whiteness and the eyes of flame, held a\n",
      "tragic, impelling beauty that stung Anson into remonstrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Riggs, don't beat up the kid,” he protested. “Thet won't do any\n",
      "good. Let her alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she's got to shut up,” replied Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How 'n hell air you goin' to shet her up? Mebbe if you get out of her\n",
      "sight she'll be quiet.... How about thet, girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson gnawed his drooping mustache as he eyed Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have I made any kick to you or your men yet?” she queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It strikes me you 'ain't,” replied Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't hear me make any so long as I'm treated decent,” said Bo.\n",
      "“I don't know what you've got to do with Riggs. He ran me down--roped\n",
      "me--dragged me to your camp. Now I've a hunch you're waiting for\n",
      "Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What's thet? I reckon you're Nell Rayner, who got left all old\n",
      "Auchincloss's property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'm Bo Rayner. Nell is my sister. She owns the ranch. Beasley\n",
      "wanted her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson cursed deep and low. Under his sharp, bristling eyebrows he bent\n",

      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Wal, why in the hell did you drag her into my camp an' off up\n",
      "here to signal Beasley? He ain't wantin' her. He wants the girl who owns\n",

      "\n",
      "Riggs shook his head. He was paler now and sweating more freely. The\n",
      "dank hair hung wet over his forehead. His manner was that of a man\n",
      "suddenly realizing he had gotten into a tight place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he's a liar!” exclaimed Bo, with contemptuous ring in her voice.\n",

      "Anson studied his right-hand man for a moment, then, taking out his\n",
      "tobacco-pouch, he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely\n",
      "to roll a cigarette. He put it between his thin lips and apparently\n",
      "forgot to light it. For a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and\n",
      "some scant sage-brush. Riggs took to pacing up and down. Wilson leaned\n",
      "as before against the cedar. The girl slowly recovered from her excess\n",
      "of anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kid, see hyar,” said Anson, addressing the girl; “if Riggs knowed you\n",
      "wasn't Nell an' fetched you along anyhow--what 'd he do thet fur?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He chased me--caught me. Then he saw some one after us and he hurried\n",
      "to your camp. He was afraid--the cur!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs heard her reply, for he turned a malignant glance upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anson, I fetched her because I know Nell Rayner will give up anythin'\n",
      "on earth for her,” he said, in loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson pondered this statement with an air of considering its apparent\n",
      "sincerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't you believe him,” declared Bo Rayner, bluntly. “He's a liar. He's\n",
      "double-crossing Beasley and all of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs raised a shaking hand to clench it at her. “Keep still or it 'll\n",
      "be the worse for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs, shut up yourself,” put in Anson, as he leisurely rose. “Mebbe it\n",
      "'ain't occurred to you thet she might have some talk interestin' to me.\n",
      "An' I'm runnin' this hyar camp. ... Now, kid, talk up an' say what you\n",
      "like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said he was double-crossing you all,” replied the girl, instantly.\n",
      "“Why, I'm surprised you'd be caught in his company! My uncle Al and\n",
      "my sweetheart Carmichael and my friend Dale--they've all told me what\n",
      "Western men are, even down to outlaws, robbers, cutthroat rascals like\n",
      "you. And I know the West well enough now to be sure that four-flush\n",
      "doesn't belong here and can't last here. He went to Dodge City once\n",
      "and when he came back he made a bluff at being a bad man. He was a\n",
      "swaggering, bragging, drinking gun-fighter. He talked of the men he'd\n",
      "shot, of the fights he'd had. He dressed like some of those gun-throwing\n",
      "gamblers.... He was in love with my sister Nell. She hated him. He\n",
      "followed us out West and he has hung on our actions like a sneaking\n",
      "Indian. Why, Nell and I couldn't even walk to the store in the village.\n",
      "He rode after me out on the range--chased me.... For that Carmichael\n",
      "called Riggs's bluff down in Turner's saloon. Dared him to draw! Cussed\n",
      "him every name on the range! Slapped and beat and kicked him! Drove him\n",
      "out of Pine!... And now, whatever he has said to Beasley or you, it's a\n",
      "dead sure bet he's playing his own game. That's to get hold of Nell, and\n",
      "if not her--then me!... Oh, I'm out of breath--and I'm out of names to\n",
      "call him. If I talked forever--I'd never be--able to--do him justice.\n",
      "But lend me--a gun--a minute!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson's quiet form vibrated with a start. Anson with his admiring\n",
      "smile pulled his gun and, taking a couple of steps forward, held it out\n",
      "butt first. She stretched eagerly for it and he jerked it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on there!” yelled Riggs, in alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Damme, Jim, if she didn't mean bizness!” exclaimed the outlaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, now--see heah, Miss. Would you bore him--if you hed a gun?”\n",
      " inquired Wilson, with curious interest. There was more of respect in his\n",
      "demeanor than admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I don't want his cowardly blood on my hands,” replied the girl.\n",
      "“But I'd make him dance--I'd make him run.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore you can handle a gun?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She nodded her answer while her eyes flashed hate and her resolute lips\n",
      "twitched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Wilson made a singularly swift motion and his gun was pitched butt\n",
      "first to within a foot of her hand. She snatched it up, cocked it, aimed\n",
      "it, all before Anson could move. But he yelled:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drop thet gun, you little devil!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs turned ghastly as the big blue gun lined on him. He also yelled,\n",
      "but that yell was different from Anson's.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Run or dance!” cried the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big gun boomed and leaped almost out of her hand. She took both\n",
      "hands, and called derisively as she fired again. The second bullet hit\n",
      "at Riggs's feet, scattering the dust and fragments of stone all over\n",
      "him. He bounded here--there--then darted for the rocks. A third time the\n",
      "heavy gun spoke and this bullet must have ticked Riggs, for he let out a\n",
      "hoarse bawl and leaped sheer for the protection of a rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plug him! Shoot off a leg!” yelled Snake Anson, whooping and stamping,\n",
      "as Riggs got out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson watched the whole performance with the same quietness\n",
      "that had characterized his manner toward the girl. Then, as Riggs\n",
      "disappeared, Wilson stepped forward and took the gun from the girl's\n",
      "trembling hands. She was whiter than ever, but still resolute and\n",
      "defiant. Wilson took a glance over in the direction Riggs had hidden and\n",
      "then proceeded to reload the gun. Snake Anson's roar of laughter ceased\n",
      "rather suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hyar, Jim, she might have held up the whole gang with thet gun,” he\n",
      "protested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon she 'ain't nothin' ag'in' us,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! You know a lot about wimmen now, don't you? But thet did my\n",
      "heart good. Jim, what 'n earth would you have did if thet 'd been you\n",
      "instead of Riggs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The query seemed important and amazing. Wilson pondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'd stood there--stock-still--an' never moved an eye-winker.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' let her shoot!” ejaculated Anson, nodding his long head. “Me, too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So these rough outlaws, inured to all the violence and baseness of their\n",
      "dishonest calling, rose to the challenging courage of a slip of a girl.\n",
      "She had the one thing they respected--nerve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then a halloo, from the promontory brought Anson up with a start.\n",
      "Muttering to himself, he strode out toward the jagged rocks that hid the\n",
      "outlook. Moze shuffled his burly form after Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, it shore was grand--thet performance of Mister Gunman Riggs,”\n",
      " remarked Jim Wilson, attentively studying the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much obliged to you for lending me your gun,” she replied. “I--I hope I\n",
      "hit him--a little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if you didn't sting him, then Jim Wilson knows nothin' about\n",
      "lead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim Wilson? Are you the man--the outlaw my uncle Al knew?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I am, miss. Fer I knowed Al shore enough. What 'd he say aboot\n",
      "me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember once he was telling me about Snake Anson's gang. He\n",
      "mentioned you. Said you were a real gun-fighter. And what a shame it was\n",
      "you had to be an outlaw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal! An' so old Al spoke thet nice of me.... It's tolerable likely I'll\n",
      "remember. An' now, miss, can I do anythin' for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Swift as a flash she looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, shore I don't mean much, I'm sorry to say. Nothin' to make\n",
      "you look like thet.... I hev to be an outlaw, shore as you're born.\n",
      "But--mebbe there's a difference in outlaws.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She understood him and paid him the compliment not to voice her sudden\n",
      "upflashing hope that he might be one to betray his leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please take this rope off my feet. Let me walk a little. Let me have\n",
      "a--a little privacy. That fool watched every move I made. I promise not\n",
      "to run away. And, oh! I'm thirsty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore you've got sense.” He freed her feet and helped her get up.\n",
      "“There'll be some fresh water any minit now, if you'll wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turned his back and walked over to where Riggs sat nursing a\n",
      "bullet-burn on his leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Riggs, I'm takin' the responsibility of loosin' the girl for a\n",
      "little spell. She can't get away. An' there ain't any sense in bein'\n",
      "mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs made no reply, and went on rolling down his trousers leg, lapped\n",
      "a fold over at the bottom and pulled on his boot. Then he strode out\n",
      "toward the promontory. Half-way there he encountered Anson tramping\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley's comin' one way an' Shady's comin' another. We'll be off this\n",
      "hot point of rock by noon,” said the outlaw leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs went on to the promontory to look for himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's the girl?” demanded Anson, in surprise, when he got back to the\n",
      "camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, she's walkin' 'round between heah an' Pine,” drawled Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you let her loose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I did. She's been hawg-tied all the time. An' she said she'd not\n",
      "run off. I'd take thet girl's word even to a sheep-thief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh. So would I, for all of thet. But, Jim, somethin's workin' in\n",
      "you. Ain't you sort of rememberin' a time when you was young--an' mebbe\n",
      "knowed pretty kids like this one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if I am it 'll shore turn out bad fer somebody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson gave him a surprised stare and suddenly lost the bantering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! So thet's how it's workin',” he replied, and flung himself down\n",
      "in the shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Burt made his appearance then, wiping his sallow face. His\n",
      "deep-set, hungry eyes, upon which his comrades set such store, roved\n",
      "around the camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whar's the gurl?” he queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim let her go out fer a stroll,” replied Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen Jim was gittin' softy over her. Haw! Haw! Haw!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Snake Anson did not crack a smile. The atmosphere appeared not to be\n",
      "congenial for jokes, a fact Burt rather suddenly divined. Riggs and Moze\n",
      "returned from the promontory, the latter reporting that Shady Jones was\n",
      "riding up close. Then the girl walked slowly into sight and approached\n",
      "to find a seat within ten yards of the group. They waited in silence\n",
      "until the expected horseman rode up with water-bottles slung on both\n",
      "sides of his saddle. His advent was welcome. All the men were thirsty.\n",
      "Wilson took water to the girl before drinking himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's an all-fired hot ride fer water,” declared the outlaw Shady, who\n",
      "somehow fitted his name in color and impression. “An', boss, if it's the\n",
      "same to you I won't take it ag'in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cheer up, Shady. We'll be rustlin' back in the mountains before\n",
      "sundown,” said Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hang me if that ain't the cheerfulest news I've hed in some days. Hey,\n",
      "Moze?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The black-faced Moze nodded his shaggy head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm sick an' sore of this deal,” broke out Burt, evidently encouraged\n",
      "by his elders. “Ever since last fall we've been hangin' 'round--till\n",
      "jest lately freezin' in camps--no money--no drink--no grub wuth havin'.\n",
      "All on promises!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not improbably this young and reckless member of the gang had struck\n",
      "the note of discord. Wilson seemed most detached from any sentiment\n",
      "prevailing there. Some strong thoughts were revolving in his brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Burt, you ain't insinuatin' thet I made promises?” inquired Anson,\n",
      "ominously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, boss, I ain't. You allus said we might hit it rich. But them\n",
      "promises was made to you. An' it 'd be jest like thet greaser to go back\n",
      "on his word now we got the gurl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Son, it happens we got the wrong one. Our long-haired pard hyar--Mister\n",
      "Riggs--him with the big gun--he waltzes up with this sassy kid instead\n",
      "of the woman Beasley wanted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Burt snorted his disgust while Shady Jones, roundly swearing, pelted\n",
      "the smoldering camp-fire with stones. Then they all lapsed into surly\n",
      "silence. The object of their growing scorn, Riggs, sat a little\n",
      "way apart, facing none of them, but maintaining as bold a front as\n",
      "apparently he could muster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a horse shot up his ears, the first indication of scent or\n",
      "sound imperceptible to the men. But with this cue they all, except\n",
      "Wilson, sat up attentively. Soon the crack of iron-shod hoofs on stone\n",
      "broke the silence. Riggs nervously rose to his feet. And the others,\n",
      "still excepting Wilson, one by one followed suit. In another moment a\n",
      "rangy bay horse trotted out of the cedars, up to the camp, and his rider\n",
      "jumped off nimbly for so heavy a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Beasley?” was Anson's greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Snake, old man!” replied Beasley, as his bold, snapping black\n",
      "eyes swept the group. He was dusty and hot, and wet with sweat, yet\n",
      "evidently too excited to feel discomfort. “I seen your smoke signal\n",
      "first off an' jumped my hoss quick. But I rode north of Pine before I\n",
      "headed 'round this way. Did you corral the girl or did Riggs? Say!--you\n",
      "look queer!... What's wrong here? You haven't signaled me for nothin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson beckoned to Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come out of the shade. Let him look you over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl walked out from under the spreading cedar that had hidden her\n",
      "from sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley stared aghast--his jaw dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's the kid sister of the woman I wanted!” he ejaculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So we've jest been told.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Astonishment still held Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Told?” he echoed. Suddenly his big body leaped with a start. “Who got\n",
      "her? Who fetched her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Mister Gunman Riggs hyar,” replied Anson, with a subtle scorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs, you got the wrong girl,” shouted Beasley. “You made thet mistake\n",
      "once before. What're you up to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I chased her an' when I got her, seein' it wasn't Nell Rayner--why--I\n",
      "kept her, anyhow,” replied Riggs. “An' I've got a word for your ear\n",
      "alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man, you're crazy--queerin' my deal thet way!” roared Beasley. “You\n",
      "heard my plans.... Riggs, this girl-stealin' can't be done twice. Was\n",
      "you drinkin' or locoed or what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley, he was giving you the double-cross,” cut in Bo Rayner's cool\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rancher stared speechlessly at her, then at Anson, then at Wilson,\n",
      "and last at Riggs, when his brown visage shaded dark with rush of purple\n",
      "blood. With one lunge he knocked Riggs flat, then stood over him with a\n",
      "convulsive hand at his gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You white-livered card-sharp! I've a notion to bore you.... They told\n",
      "me you had a deal of your own, an' now I believe it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--I had,” replied Riggs, cautiously getting up. He was ghastly. “But\n",
      "I wasn't double-crossin' you. Your deal was to get the girl away from\n",
      "home so you could take possession of her property. An' I wanted her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for did you fetch the sister, then?” demanded Beasley, his big jaw\n",
      "bulging.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I've a plan to--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plan hell! You've spoiled my plan an' I've seen about enough of you.”\n",
      " Beasley breathed hard; his lowering gaze boded an uncertain will toward\n",
      "the man who had crossed him; his hand still hung low and clutching.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley, tell them to get my horse. I want to go home,” said Bo Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly Beasley turned. Her words enjoined a silence. What to do with her\n",
      "now appeared a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had nothin' to do with fetchin' you here an' I'll have nothin' to do\n",
      "with sendin' you back or whatever's done with you,” declared Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the girl's face flashed white again and her eyes changed to fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're as big a liar as Riggs,” she cried, passionately. “And you're\n",
      "a thief, a bully who picks on defenseless girls. Oh, we know your game!\n",
      "Milt Dale heard your plot with this outlaw Anson to steal my sister. You\n",
      "ought to be hanged--you half-breed greaser!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll cut out your tongue!” hissed Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'll bet you would if you had me alone. But these outlaws--these\n",
      "sheep-thieves--these tools you hire are better than you and Riggs....\n",
      "What do you suppose Carmichael will do to you? Carmichael! He's my\n",
      "sweetheart--that cowboy. You know what he did to Riggs. Have you brains\n",
      "enough to know what he'll do to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He'll not do much,” growled Beasley. But the thick purplish blood was\n",
      "receding from his face. “Your cowpuncher--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah!” she interrupted, and she snapped her fingers in his face. “He's\n",
      "from Texas! He's from TEXAS!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Supposin' he is from Texas?” demanded Beasley, in angry irritation.\n",
      "“What's thet? Texans are all over. There's Jim Wilson, Snake Anson's\n",
      "right-hand man. He's from Texas. But thet ain't scarin' any one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He pointed toward Wilson, who shifted uneasily from foot to foot. The\n",
      "girl's flaming glance followed his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you from Texas?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss, I am--an' I reckon I don't deserve it,” replied Wilson. It\n",
      "was certain that a vague shame attended his confession.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I believed even a bandit from Texas would fight for a helpless\n",
      "girl!” she replied, in withering scorn of disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson dropped his head. If any one there suspected a serious\n",
      "turn to Wilson's attitude toward that situation it was the keen outlaw\n",
      "leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley, you're courtin' death,” he broke in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You bet you are!” added Bo, with a passion that made her listeners\n",
      "quiver. “You've put me at the mercy of a gang of outlaws! You may force\n",
      "my sister out of her home! But your day will come.' Tom Carmichael will\n",
      "KILL you.”\n",

      "rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "This start was made a little after the noon hour. They zigzagged up the\n",
      "slope, took to a deep ravine, and followed it up to where it headed in\n",
      "the level forest. From there travel was rapid, the pack-horses being\n",
      "driven at a jogtrot. Once when a troop of deer burst out of a thicket\n",
      "into a glade, to stand with ears high, young Burt halted the cavalcade.\n",
      "His well-aimed shot brought down a deer. Then the men rode on, leaving\n",
      "him behind to dress and pack the meat. The only other halt made was at\n",
      "the crossing of the first water, a clear, swift brook, where both horses\n",
      "and men drank thirstily. Here Burt caught up with his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "They traversed glade and park, and wended a crooked trail through the\n",
      "deepening forest, and climbed, bench after bench, to higher ground,\n",
      "while the sun sloped to the westward, lower and redder. Sunset had gone,\n",
      "and twilight was momentarily brightening to the afterglow when Anson,\n",
      "breaking his silence of the afternoon, ordered a halt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place was wild, dismal, a shallow vale between dark slopes of\n",
      "spruce. Grass, fire-wood, and water were there in abundance. All the\n",
      "men were off, throwing saddles and packs, before the tired girl made an\n",
      "effort to get down. Riggs, observing her, made a not ungentle move to\n",
      "pull her off. She gave him a sounding slap with her gloved hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your paws to yourself,” she said. No evidence of exhaustion was\n",
      "there in her spirit.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "was doin' the elegant,” replied Moze, who stood nearest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, was you watchin'?” queried Anson. His curiosity had held through\n",
      "the afternoon.\n",

      "Many hands made quick work. In a few moments a fire was burning\n",
      "brightly, water was boiling, pots were steaming, the odor of venison\n",
      "permeated the cool air. The girl had at last slipped off her saddle to\n",
      "the ground, where she sat while Riggs led the horse away. She sat there\n",
      "apparently forgotten, a pathetic droop to her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson had taken an ax and was vigorously wielding it among the spruces.\n",
      "One by one they fell with swish and soft crash. Then the sliding ring\n",
      "of the ax told how he was slicing off the branches with long sweeps.\n",
      "Presently he appeared in the semi-darkness, dragging half-trimmed\n",
      "spruces behind him. He made several trips, the last of which was to\n",
      "stagger under a huge burden of spruce boughs. These he spread under a\n",
      "low, projecting branch of an aspen. Then he leaned the bushy spruces\n",
      "slantingly against this branch on both sides, quickly improvising a\n",
      "V-shaped shelter with narrow aperture in front. Next from one of\n",
      "the packs he took a blanket and threw that inside the shelter. Then,\n",
      "touching the girl on the shoulder, he whispered:\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you're ready, slip in there. An' don't lose no sleep by worryin',\n",
      "fer I'll be layin' right here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made a motion to indicate his length across the front of the narrow\n",
      "aperture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, thank you! Maybe you really are a Texan,” she whispered back.\n",

      "The girl refused to take food proffered her by Riggs, but she ate and\n",

      "\n",
      "Whatever loquacity and companionship had previously existed in\n",

      "preoccupied, as if pondering the dawn in his mind of an ill omen not\n",
      "clear to him yet and not yet dreamed of by his fellows. They all smoked.\n",
      "Then Moze and Shady played cards awhile by the light of the fire, but it\n",
      "was a dull game, in which either seldom spoke. Riggs sought his blanket\n",
      "first, and the fact was significant that he lay down some distance from\n",
      "the spruce shelter which contained Bo Rayner. Presently young Burt went\n",

      "unearthly through the spruce. An occasional thump of hoof sounded from\n",

      "wildness of forest-land.\n",

      "Anson. Then he threw up his hands in a strange gesture of resignation.\n",
      "The outlaw was brave, but all men of the wilds recognized a force\n",
      "stronger than themselves. He sat there resembling a brooding snake with\n",
      "basilisk eyes upon the fire. At length he arose, and without another\n",
      "word to his comrade he walked wearily to where lay the dark, quiet forms\n",
      "of the sleepers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson remained beside the flickering fire. He was reading something\n",
      "in the red embers, perhaps the past. Shadows were on his face, not all\n",
      "from the fading flames or the towering spruces. Ever and anon he raised\n",
      "his head to listen, not apparently that he expected any unusual sound,\n",
      "but as if involuntarily. Indeed, as Anson had said, there was something\n",
      "nameless in the air. The black forest breathed heavily, in fitful moans\n",
      "of wind. It had its secrets. The glances Wilson threw on all sides\n",
      "betrayed that any hunted man did not love the dark night, though it hid\n",
      "him. Wilson seemed fascinated by the life inclosed there by the black\n",
      "circle of spruce. He might have been reflecting on the strange reaction\n",
      "happening to every man in that group, since a girl had been brought\n",
      "among them. Nothing was clear, however; the forest kept its secret, as\n",
      "did the melancholy wind; the outlaws were sleeping like tired beasts,\n",
      "with their dark secrets locked in their hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Wilson put some sticks on the red embers, then pulled the\n",
      "end of a log over them. A blaze sputtered up, changing the dark circle\n",
      "and showing the sleepers with their set, shadowed faces upturned. Wilson\n",
      "gazed on all of them, a sardonic smile on his lips, and then his look\n",
      "fixed upon the sleeper apart from the others--Riggs. It might have been\n",
      "the false light of flame and shadow that created Wilson's expression of\n",
      "dark and terrible hate. Or it might have been the truth, expressed\n",
      "in that lonely, unguarded hour, from the depths of a man born in the\n",
      "South--a man who by his inheritance of race had reverence for all\n",
      "womanhood--by whose strange, wild, outlawed bloody life of a gun-fighter\n",
      "he must hate with the deadliest hate this type that aped and mocked his\n",
      "fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long gaze Wilson rested upon Riggs--as strange and secretive as\n",
      "the forest wind moaning down the great aisles--and when that dark gaze\n",
      "was withdrawn Wilson stalked away to make his bed with the stride of one\n",
      "ill whom spirit had liberated force.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid his saddle in front of the spruce shelter where the girl had\n",
      "entered, and his tarpaulin and blankets likewise and then wearily\n",
      "stretched his long length to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camp-fire blazed up, showing the exquisite green and brown-flecked\n",
      "festooning of the spruce branches, symmetrical and perfect, yet so\n",
      "irregular, and then it burned out and died down, leaving all in the dim\n",
      "gray starlight. The horses were not moving around; the moan of night\n",
      "wind had grown fainter; the low hum of insects was dying away; even\n",
      "the tinkle of the brook had diminished. And that growth toward absolute\n",
      "silence continued, yet absolute silence was never attained. Life abided\n",
      "in the forest; only it had changed its form for the dark hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's gang did not bestir themselves at the usual early sunrise hour\n",
      "common to all woodsmen, hunters, or outlaws, to whom the break of day\n",
      "was welcome. These companions--Anson and Riggs included--might have\n",
      "hated to see the dawn come. It meant only another meager meal, then\n",
      "the weary packing and the long, long ride to nowhere in particular,\n",
      "and another meager meal--all toiled for without even the necessities of\n",
      "satisfactory living, and assuredly without the thrilling hopes that\n",
      "made their life significant, and certainly with a growing sense of\n",
      "approaching calamity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlaw leader rose surly and cross-grained. He had to boot Burt\n",
      "to drive him out for the horses. Riggs followed him. Shady Jones did\n",
      "nothing except grumble. Wilson, by common consent, always made the\n",
      "sour-dough bread, and he was slow about it this morning. Anson and Moze\n",
      "did the rest of the work, without alacrity. The girl did not appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she dead?” growled Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, she ain't,” replied Wilson, looking up. “She's sleepin'. Let her\n",
      "sleep. She'd shore be a sight better off if she was daid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! So would all of this hyar outfit,” was Anson's response.\n",
      "\n",

      "Anson did not address the Texas member of his party again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burt rode bareback into camp, driving half the number of the horses;\n",
      "Riggs followed shortly with several more. But three were missed, one\n",
      "of them being Anson's favorite. He would not have budged without that\n",
      "horse. During breakfast he growled about his lazy men, and after the\n",
      "meal tried to urge them off. Riggs went unwillingly. Burt refused to go\n",
      "at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nix. I footed them hills all I'm a-goin' to,” he said. “An' from now on\n",
      "I rustle my own hoss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The leader glared his reception of this opposition. Perhaps his sense of\n",
      "fairness actuated him once more, for he ordered Shady and Moze out to do\n",
      "their share.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you're the best tracker in this outfit. Suppose you go,” suggested\n",
      "Anson. “You allus used to be the first one off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Times has changed, Snake,” was the imperturbable reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, won't you go?” demanded the leader, impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shore won't.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson did not look or intimate in any way that he would not leave the\n",
      "girl in camp with one or any or all of Anson's gang, but the truth was\n",
      "as significant as if he had shouted it. The slow-thinking Moze gave\n",
      "Wilson a sinister look.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, ain't it funny how a pretty wench--?” began Shady Jones,\n",
      "sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up, you fool!” broke in Anson. “Come on, I'll help rustle them\n",
      "hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had gone Burt took his rifle and strolled off into the\n",
      "forest. Then the girl appeared. Her hair was down, her face pale, with\n",
      "dark shadows. She asked for water to wash her face. Wilson pointed to\n",
      "the brook, and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean\n",
      "scarf from his pack and carried them to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon her return to the camp-fire she looked very different with her hair\n",
      "arranged and the red stains in her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, air you hungry?” asked Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He helped her to portions of bread, venison and gravy, and a cup of\n",
      "coffee. Evidently she relished the meat, but she had to force down the\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are they all?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rustlin' the hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably she divined that he did not want to talk, for the fleeting\n",
      "glance she gave him attested to a thought that his voice or demeanor had\n",
      "changed. Presently she sought a seat under the aspen-tree, out of\n",
      "the sun, and the smoke continually blowing in her face; and there she\n",
      "stayed, a forlorn little figure, for all the resolute lips and defiant\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Texan paced to and fro beside the camp-fire with bent head,\n",
      "and hands locked behind him. But for the swinging gun he would have\n",
      "resembled a lanky farmer, coatless and hatless, with his brown vest\n",
      "open, his trousers stuck in the top of the high boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "And neither he nor the girl changed their positions relatively for\n",
      "a long time. At length, however, after peering into the woods, and\n",
      "listening, he remarked to the girl that he would be back in a moment,\n",
      "and then walked off around the spruces.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had he disappeared--in fact, so quickly after-ward that it\n",
      "presupposed design instead of accident--than Riggs came running from the\n",
      "opposite side of the glade. He ran straight to the girl, who sprang to\n",
      "her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hid--two of the--horses,” he panted, husky with excitement. “I'll\n",
      "take--two saddles. You grab some grub. We'll run for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she cried, stepping back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it's not safe--for us--here,” he said, hurriedly, glancing all\n",
      "around. “I'll take you--home. I swear.... Not safe--I tell you--this\n",
      "gang's after me. Hurry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid hold of two saddles, one with each hand. The moment had reddened\n",
      "his face, brightened his eyes, made his action strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm safer--here with this outlaw gang,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't come!” His color began to lighten then, and his face to\n",
      "distort. He dropped his hold on the saddles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, I'd rather become a toy and a rag for these ruffians than\n",
      "spend an hour alone with you,” she flashed at him, in unquenchable hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll drag you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized her, but could not hold her. Breaking away, she screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Help!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That whitened his face, drove him to frenzy. Leaping forward, he struck\n",
      "her a hard blow across the mouth. It staggered her, and, tripping on a\n",
      "saddle, she fell. His hands flew to her throat, ready to choke her. But\n",
      "she lay still and held her tongue. Then he dragged her to her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hurry now--grab that pack--an' follow me.” Again Riggs laid hold of the\n",
      "two saddles. A desperate gleam, baleful and vainglorious, flashed over\n",
      "his face. He was living his one great adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl's eyes dilated. They looked beyond him. Her lips opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scream again an' I'll kill you!” he cried, hoarsely and swiftly. The\n",
      "very opening of her lips had terrified Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon one scream was enough,” spoke a voice, slow, but without the\n",
      "drawl, easy and cool, yet incalculable in some terrible sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs wheeled with inarticulate cry. Wilson stood a few paces off, with\n",
      "his gun half leveled, low down. His face seemed as usual, only his eyes\n",
      "held a quivering, light intensity, like boiling molten silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girl, what made thet blood on your mouth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs hit me!” she whispered. Then at something she feared or saw or\n",
      "divined she shrank back, dropped on her knees, and crawled into the\n",
      "spruce shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Riggs, I'd invite you to draw if thet 'd be any use,” said Wilson.\n",
      "This speech was reflective, yet it hurried a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs could not draw nor move nor speak. He seemed turned to stone,\n",
      "except his jaw, which slowly fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, gunman from down Missouri way,” continued the voice of\n",
      "incalculable intent, “reckon you've looked into a heap of gun-barrels in\n",
      "your day. Shore! Wal, look in this heah one!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson deliberately leveled the gun on a line with Riggs's starting\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't you heard to brag in Turner's saloon--thet you could see lead\n",
      "comin'--an' dodge it? Shore you must be swift!... DODGE THIS HEAH\n",
      "BULLET!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gun spouted flame and boomed. One of Riggs's starting, popping\n",
      "eyes--the right one--went out, like a lamp. The other rolled horribly,\n",
      "then set in blank dead fixedness. Riggs swayed in slow motion until a\n",
      "lost balance felled him heavily, an inert mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson bent over the prostrate form. Strange, violent contrast to the\n",
      "cool scorn of the preceding moment! Hissing, spitting, as if poisoned by\n",
      "passion, he burst with the hate that his character had forbidden him to\n",
      "express on a living counterfeit. Wilson was shaken, as if by a palsy. He\n",
      "choked over passionate, incoherent invective. It was class hate first,\n",
      "then the hate of real manhood for a craven, then the hate of disgrace\n",
      "for a murder. No man so fair as a gun-fighter in the Western creed of an\n",
      "“even break”!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's terrible cataclysm of passion passed. Straightening up, he\n",
      "sheathed his weapon and began a slow pace before the fire. Not many\n",
      "moments afterward he jerked his head high and listened. Horses were\n",
      "softly thudding through the forest. Soon Anson rode into sight with\n",
      "his men and one of the strayed horses. It chanced, too, that young Burt\n",
      "appeared on the other side of the glade. He walked quickly, as one who\n",
      "anticipated news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson as he dismounted espied the dead man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--I thought I heard a shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The others exclaimed and leaped off their horses to view the prostrate\n",
      "form with that curiosity and strange fear common to all men confronted\n",
      "by sight of sudden death.\n",
      "\n",
      "That emotion was only momentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shot his lamp out!” ejaculated Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wonder how Gunman Riggs liked thet plumb center peg!” exclaimed Shady\n",
      "Jones, with a hard laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Back of his head all gone!” gasped young Burt. Not improbably he had\n",
      "not seen a great many bullet-marked men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim!--the long-haired fool didn't try to draw on you!” exclaimed Snake\n",
      "Anson, astounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson neither spoke nor ceased his pacing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was it over?” added Anson, curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He hit the gurl,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there were long-drawn exclamations all around, and glance met\n",
      "glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you saved me the job,” continued the outlaw leader. “An' I'm much\n",
      "obliged.... Fellars, search Riggs an' we'll divvy.... Thet all right,\n",
      "Jim?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, an' you can have my share.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They found bank-notes in the man's pocket and considerable gold worn in\n",
      "a money-belt around his waist. Shady Jones appropriated his boots, and\n",
      "Moze his gun. Then they left him as he had fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you'll have to track them lost hosses. Two still missin' an' one\n",
      "of them's mine,” called Anson as Wilson paced to the end of his beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl heard Anson, for she put her head out of the spruce shelter and\n",
      "called: “Riggs said he'd hid two of the horses. They must be close. He\n",
      "came that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, kid! Thet's good news,” replied Anson. His spirits were rising.\n",
      "“He must hev wanted you to slope with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I wouldn't go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' then he hit you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, recallin' your talk of yestiddy, I can't see as Mister Riggs\n",
      "lasted much longer hyar than he'd hev lasted in Texas. We've some of\n",
      "thet great country right in our outfit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl withdrew her white face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's break camp, boys,” was the leader's order. “A couple of you look\n",
      "up them hosses. They'll be hid in some thick spruces. The rest of us 'll\n",
      "pack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the gang was on the move, heading toward the height of land, and\n",
      "swerving from it only to find soft and grassy ground that would not\n",
      "leave any tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not travel more than a dozen miles during the afternoon, but\n",
      "they climbed bench after bench until they reached the timbered plateau\n",
      "that stretched in sheer black slope up to the peaks. Here rose the great\n",
      "and gloomy forest of firs and pines, with the spruce overshadowed and\n",
      "thinned out. The last hour of travel was tedious and toilsome, a zigzag,\n",
      "winding, breaking, climbing hunt for the kind of camp-site suited\n",
      "to Anson's fancy. He seemed to be growing strangely irrational about\n",
      "selecting places to camp. At last, for no reason that could have been\n",
      "manifest to a good woodsman, he chose a gloomy bowl in the center of the\n",
      "densest forest that had been traversed. The opening, if such it could\n",
      "have been called, was not a park or even a glade. A dark cliff, with\n",
      "strange holes, rose to one side, but not so high as the lofty pines that\n",
      "brushed it. Along its base babbled a brook, running over such formation\n",
      "of rock that from different points near at hand it gave forth different\n",
      "sounds, some singing, others melodious, and one at least of a hollow,\n",
      "weird, deep sound, not loud, but strangely penetrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure spooky I say,” observed Shady, sentiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little uplift of mood, coincident with the rifling of Riggs's\n",
      "person, had not worn over to this evening camp. What talk the outlaws\n",
      "indulged in was necessary and conducted in low tones. The place enjoined\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson performed for the girl very much the same service as he had the\n",
      "night before. Only he advised her not to starve herself; she must eat\n",
      "to keep up her strength. She complied at the expense of considerable\n",
      "effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it had been a back-breaking day, in which all of them, except the\n",
      "girl, had climbed miles on foot, they did not linger awake long enough\n",
      "after supper to learn what a wild, weird, and pitch-black spot the\n",
      "outlaw leader had chosen. The little spaces of open ground between the\n",
      "huge-trunked pine-trees had no counterpart up in the lofty spreading\n",
      "foliage. Not a star could blink a wan ray of light into that Stygian\n",
      "pit. The wind, cutting down over abrupt heights farther up, sang in the\n",
      "pine-needles as if they were strings vibrant with chords. Dismal creaks\n",
      "were audible. They were the forest sounds of branch or tree rubbing one\n",
      "another, but which needed the corrective medium of daylight to convince\n",
      "any human that they were other than ghostly. Then, despite the wind and\n",
      "despite the changing murmur of the brook, there seemed to be a silence\n",
      "insulating them, as deep and impenetrable as the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the outlaws, who were fugitives now, slept the sleep of the weary,\n",
      "and heard nothing. They awoke with the sun, when the forest seemed smoky\n",
      "in a golden gloom, when light and bird and squirrel proclaimed the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses had not strayed out of this basin during the night, a\n",
      "circumstance that Anson was not slow to appreciate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't no cheerful camp, but I never seen a safer place to hole up\n",
      "in,” he remarked to Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, yes--if any place is safe,” replied that ally, dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can watch our back tracks. There ain't any other way to git in hyar\n",
      "thet I see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, we was tolerable fair sheep-rustlers, but we're no good\n",
      "woodsmen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson grumbled his disdain of this comrade who had once been his\n",
      "mainstay. Then he sent Burt out to hunt fresh meat and engaged his other\n",
      "men at cards. As they now had the means to gamble, they at once became\n",
      "absorbed. Wilson smoked and divided his thoughtful gaze between the\n",
      "gamblers and the drooping figure of the girl. The morning air was\n",
      "keen, and she, evidently not caring to be near her captors beside the\n",
      "camp-fire, had sought the only sunny spot in this gloomy dell. A couple\n",
      "of hours passed; the sun climbed high; the air grew warmer. Once the\n",
      "outlaw leader raised his head to scan the heavy-timbered slopes that\n",
      "inclosed the camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, them hosses are strayin' off,” he observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson leisurely rose and stalked off across the small, open patches,\n",
      "in the direction of the horses. They had grazed around from the right\n",
      "toward the outlet of the brook. Here headed a ravine, dense and green.\n",
      "Two of the horses had gone down. Wilson evidently heard them, though\n",
      "they were not in sight, and he circled somewhat so as to get ahead of\n",
      "them and drive them back. The invisible brook ran down over the rocks\n",
      "with murmur and babble. He halted with instinctive action. He listened.\n",
      "Forest sounds, soft, lulling, came on the warm, pine-scented breeze. It\n",
      "would have taken no keen ear to hear soft and rapid padded footfalls.\n",
      "He moved on cautiously and turned into a little open, mossy spot,\n",
      "brown-matted and odorous, full of ferns and bluebells. In the middle\n",
      "of this, deep in the moss, he espied a huge round track of a cougar.\n",
      "He bent over it. Suddenly he stiffened, then straightened guardedly. At\n",
      "that instant he received a hard prod in the back. Throwing up his hands,\n",
      "he stood still, then slowly turned. A tall hunter in gray buckskin,\n",
      "gray-eyed and square-jawed, had him covered with a cocked rifle. And\n",
      "beside this hunter stood a monster cougar, snarling and blinking.\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER XXII\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Dale,” drawled Wilson. “Reckon you're a little previous on me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sssssh! Not so loud,” said the hunter, in low voice. “You're Jim\n",
      "Wilson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore am. Say, Dale, you showed up soon. Or did you jest happen to run\n",

      "\n",
      "“I knowed thet when I seen you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cougar seemed actuated by the threatening position of his master,\n",
      "and he opened his mouth, showing great yellow fangs, and spat at Wilson.\n",
      "The outlaw apparently had no fear of Dale or the cocked rifle, but that\n",
      "huge, snarling cat occasioned him uneasiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson, I've heard you spoken of as a white outlaw,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Wal, lemme see. Supposin' I refuse?” queried Wilson, shrewdly.\n",

      "“Reckon I 'ain't got much choice. Yes, I'll do it. But, Dale, are you\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am. You're no fool. An' I believe you're square. I've got Anson\n",
      "and his gang corralled. You can't slip me--not in these woods. I could\n",
      "run off your horses--pick you off one by one--or turn the cougar loose\n",
      "on you at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. It's your game. Anson dealt himself this hand.... Between you\n",

      "“But, Dale, listen,” remonstrated Wilson, earnestly. “Too quick 'll\n",
      "be as bad as too slow. Snake is sore these days, gittin' sorer all the\n",
      "time. He might savvy somethin', if I ain't careful, an' kill the girl\n",
      "or do her harm. I know these fellars. They're all ready to go to pieces.\n",
      "An' shore I must play safe. Shore it'd be safer to have a plan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's shrewd, light eyes gleamed with an idea. He was about to lower\n",
      "one of his upraised hands, evidently to point to the cougar, when he\n",
      "thought better of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anson's scared of cougars. Mebbe we can scare him an' the gang so it\n",
      "'d be easy to sneak the girl off. Can you make thet big brute do tricks?\n",
      "Rush the camp at night an' squall an' chase off the horses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll guarantee to scare Anson out of ten years' growth,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's a go, then,” resumed Wilson, as if glad. “I'll post the\n",
      "girl--give her a hunch to do her part. You sneak up to-night jest before\n",
      "dark. I'll hev the gang worked up. An' then you put the cougar to his\n",
      "tricks, whatever you want. When the gang gits wild I'll grab the girl\n",
      "an' pack her off down heah or somewheres aboot an' whistle fer you....\n",
      "But mebbe thet ain't so good. If thet cougar comes pilin' into camp he\n",
      "might jump me instead of one of the gang. An' another hunch. He might\n",
      "slope up on me in the dark when I was tryin' to find you. Shore thet\n",
      "ain't appealin' to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson, this cougar is a pet,” replied Dale. “You think he's dangerous,\n",
      "but he's not. No more than a kitten. He only looks fierce. He has never\n",
      "been hurt by a person an' he's never fought anythin' himself but deer\n",
      "an' bear. I can make him trail any scent. But the truth is I couldn't\n",
      "make him hurt you or anybody. All the same, he can be made to scare the\n",
      "hair off any one who doesn't know him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore thet settles me. I'll be havin' a grand joke while them fellars\n",
      "is scared to death.... Dale, you can depend on me. An' I'm beholdin'\n",
      "to you fer what 'll square me some with myself.... To-night, an' if it\n",
      "won't work then, to-morrer night shore!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale lowered the rifle. The big cougar spat again. Wilson dropped his\n",
      "hands and, stepping forward, split the green wall of intersecting spruce\n",
      "branches. Then he turned up the ravine toward the glen. Once there, in\n",
      "sight of his comrades, his action and expression changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hosses all thar, Jim?” asked Anson, as he picked up, his cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. They act awful queer, them hosses,” replied. Wilson. “They're\n",
      "afraid of somethin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Silvertip mebbe,” muttered Anson. “Jim, You jest keep watch of\n",

      "\n",
      "“Reckon I'm elected to do all the work now,” complained Wilson, “while\n",

      "fire-wood. Cook an' wash. Hey?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one I ever seen can do them camp tricks any better 'n Jim Wilson,”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Jim, you're a lady's man an' thar's our pretty hoodoo over thar to\n",
      "feed an' amoose,” remarked Shady Jones, with a smile that disarmed his\n",

      "\n",
      "The outlaws guffawed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Git out, Jim, you're breakin' up the game,” said Moze, who appeared\n",
      "loser.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet gurl would starve if it wasn't fer me,” replied Wilson,\n",
      "genially, and he walked over toward her, beginning to address her, quite\n",
      "loudly, as he approached. “Wal, miss, I'm elected cook an' I'd shore\n",
      "like to heah what you fancy fer dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlaws heard, for they guffawed again. “Haw! Haw! if Jim ain't\n",
      "funny!” exclaimed Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl looked up amazed. Wilson was winking at her, and when he got\n",
      "near he began to speak rapidly and low.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I jest met Dale down in the woods with his pet cougar. He's after you.\n",
      "I'm goin' to help him git you safe away. Now you do your part. I want\n",
      "you to pretend you've gone crazy. Savvy? Act out of your head! Shore\n",
      "I don't care what you do or say, only act crazy. An' don't be scared.\n",
      "We're goin' to scare the gang so I'll hev a chance to sneak you away.\n",
      "To-night or to-morrow--shore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he began to speak she was pale, sad, dull of eye. Swiftly, with\n",
      "his words, she was transformed, and when he had ended she did not appear\n",
      "the same girl. She gave him one blazing flash of comprehension and\n",
      "nodded her head rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I understand. I'll do it!” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlaw turned slowly away with the most abstract air, confounded\n",
      "amid his shrewd acting, and he did not collect himself until half-way\n",
      "back to his comrades. Then, beginning to hum an old darky tune, he\n",
      "stirred up and replenished the fire, and set about preparation for the\n",
      "midday meal. But he did not miss anything going on around him. He saw\n",
      "the girl go into her shelter and come out with her hair all down over\n",
      "her face. Wilson, back to his comrades, grinned his glee, and he wagged\n",
      "his head as if he thought the situation was developing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gambling outlaws, however, did not at once see the girl preening\n",
      "herself and smoothing her long hair in a way calculated to startle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Busted!” ejaculated Anson, with a curse, as he slammed down his cards.\n",
      "“If I ain't hoodooed I'm a two-bit of a gambler!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sartin you're hoodooed,” said Shady Jones, in scorn. “Is thet jest\n",

      "\n",
      "“Boss, you play like a cow stuck in the mud,” remarked Moze,\n",
      "laconically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fellars, it ain't funny,” declared Anson, with pathetic gravity. “I'm\n",
      "jest gittin' on to myself. Somethin's wrong. Since 'way last fall no\n",
      "luck--nothin' but the wust end of everythin'. I ain't blamin' anybody.\n",
      "I'm the boss. It's me thet's off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, shore it was the gurl deal you made,” rejoined Wilson, who had\n",
      "listened. “I told you. Our troubles hev only begun. An' I can see the\n",
      "wind-up. Look!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson pointed to where the girl stood, her hair flying wildly all over\n",
      "her face and shoulders. She was making most elaborate bows to an old\n",
      "stump, sweeping the ground with her tresses in her obeisance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson started. He grew utterly astounded. His amaze was ludicrous. And\n",
      "the other two men looked to stare, to equal their leader's bewilderment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What 'n hell's come over her?” asked Anson, dubiously. “Must hev perked\n",
      "up.... But she ain't feelin' thet gay!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson tapped his forehead with a significant finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I was scared of her this mawnin',” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naw!” exclaimed Anson, incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If she hain't queer I never seen no queer wimmin,” vouchsafed Shady\n",
      "Jones, and it would have been judged, by the way he wagged his head,\n",
      "that he had been all his days familiar with women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze looked beyond words, and quite alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen it comin',” declared Wilson, very much excited. “But I was\n",
      "scared to say so. You-all made fun of me aboot her. Now I shore wish I\n",
      "had spoken up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson nodded solemnly. He did not believe the evidence of his sight,\n",
      "but the facts seemed stunning. As if the girl were a dangerous and\n",
      "incomprehensible thing, he approached her step by step. Wilson followed,\n",
      "and the others appeared drawn irresistibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey thar--kid!” called Anson, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl drew her slight form up haughtily. Through her spreading\n",
      "tresses her eyes gleamed unnaturally upon the outlaw leader. But she\n",
      "deigned not to reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey thar--you Rayner girl!” added Anson, lamely. “What's ailin' you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My lord! did you address me?” she asked, loftily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones got over his consternation and evidently extracted some\n",
      "humor from the situation, as his dark face began to break its strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aww!” breathed Anson, heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ophelia awaits your command, my lord. I've been gathering flowers,”\n",
      " she said, sweetly, holding up her empty hands as if they contained a\n",
      "bouquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones exploded in convulsed laughter. But his merriment was not\n",
      "shared. And suddenly it brought disaster upon him. The girl flew at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you croak, you toad? I will have you whipped and put in irons,\n",
      "you scullion!” she cried, passionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady underwent a remarkable change, and stumbled in his backward\n",
      "retreat. Then she snapped her fingers in Moze's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You black devil! Get hence! Avaunt!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson plucked up courage enough to touch her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aww! Now, Ophelyar--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably he meant to try to humor her, but she screamed, and he jumped\n",
      "back as if she might burn him. She screamed shrilly, in wild, staccato\n",
      "notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You! You!” she pointed her finger at the outlaw leader. “You brute to\n",
      "women! You ran off from your wife!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson turned plum-color and then slowly white. The girl must have sent a\n",
      "random shot home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now the devil's turned you into a snake. A long, scaly snake with\n",
      "green eyes! Uugh! You'll crawl on your belly soon--when my cowboy finds\n",
      "you. And he'll tramp you in the dust.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She floated away from them and began to whirl gracefully, arms spread\n",
      "and hair flying; and then, apparently oblivious of the staring men, she\n",
      "broke into a low, sweet song. Next she danced around a pine, then danced\n",
      "into her little green inclosure. From which presently she sent out the\n",
      "most doleful moans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aww! What a shame!” burst out Anson. “Thet fine, healthy, nervy kid!\n",
      "Clean gone! Daffy! Crazy 'n a bedbug!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's a shame,” protested Wilson. “But it's wuss for us. Lord! if\n",
      "we was hoodooed before, what will we be now? Didn't I tell you, Snake\n",
      "Anson? You was warned. Ask Shady an' Moze--they see what's up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No luck 'll ever come our way ag'in,” predicted Shady, mournfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It beats me, boss, it beats me,” muttered Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A crazy woman on my hands! If thet ain't the last straw!” broke out\n",
      "Anson, tragically, as he turned away. Ignorant, superstitious, worked\n",
      "upon by things as they seemed, the outlaw imagined himself at last beset\n",
      "by malign forces. When he flung himself down upon one of the packs his\n",
      "big red-haired hands shook. Shady and Moze resembled two other men at\n",
      "the end of their ropes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's tense face twitched, and he averted it, as apparently he fought\n",
      "off a paroxysm of some nature. Just then Anson swore a thundering oath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crazy or not, I'll git gold out of thet kid!” he roared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, man, talk sense. Are you gittin' daffy, too? I declare this\n",
      "outfit's been eatin' loco. You can't git gold fer her!” said Wilson,\n",
      "deliberately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why can't I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Cause we're tracked. We can't make no dickers. Why, in another day or\n",
      "so we'll be dodgin' lead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tracked! Whar 'd you git thet idee? As soon as this?” queried Anson,\n",
      "lifting his head like a striking snake. His men, likewise, betrayed\n",
      "sudden interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's no idee. I 'ain't seen any one. But I feel it in my senses.\n",
      "I hear somebody comin'--a step on our trail--all the time--night in\n",
      "particular. Reckon there's a big posse after us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if I see or hear anythin' I'll knock the girl on the head an'\n",
      "we'll dig out of hyar,” replied Anson, sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson executed a swift forward motion, violent and passionate, so\n",
      "utterly unlike what might have been looked for from him, that the three\n",
      "outlaws gaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you'll shore hev to knock Jim Wilson on the haid first,” he said,\n",
      "in voice as strange as his action.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim! You wouldn't go back on me!” implored Anson, with uplifted hands,\n",
      "in a dignity of pathos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm losin' my haid, too, an' you shore might as well knock it in, an'\n",
      "you'll hev to before I'll stand you murderin' thet pore little gurl\n",
      "you've drove crazy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, I was only mad,” replied Anson. “Fer thet matter, I'm growin'\n",
      "daffy myself. Aw! we all need a good stiff drink of whisky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he tried to throw off gloom and apprehension, but he failed. His\n",
      "comrades did not rally to his help. Wilson walked away, nodding his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, let Jim alone,” whispered Shady. “It's orful the way you buck\n",
      "ag'in' him--when you seen he's stirred up. Jim's true blue. But you\n",
      "gotta be careful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze corroborated this statement by gloomy nods.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the card-playing was resumed, Anson did not join the game, and\n",
      "both Moze and Shady evinced little of that whole-hearted obsession which\n",
      "usually attended their gambling. Anson lay at length, his head in a\n",
      "saddle, scowling at the little shelter where the captive girl kept\n",
      "herself out of sight. At times a faint song or laugh, very unnatural,\n",
      "was wafted across the space. Wilson plodded at the cooking and\n",
      "apparently heard no sounds. Presently he called the men to eat, which\n",
      "office they surlily and silently performed, as if it was a favor\n",
      "bestowed upon the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, hadn't I ought to take a bite of grub over to the gurl?” asked\n",
      "Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you hev to ask me thet?” snapped Anson. “She's gotta be fed, if we\n",
      "hev to stuff it down her throat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I ain't stuck on the job,” replied Wilson. “But I'll tackle it,\n",
      "seein' you-all got cold feet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With plate and cup be reluctantly approached the little lean-to, and,\n",
      "kneeling, he put his head inside. The girl, quick-eyed and alert, had\n",
      "evidently seen him coming. At any rate, she greeted him with a cautious\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, was I pretty good?” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, you was shore the finest aktress I ever seen,” he responded, in a\n",
      "low voice. “But you dam near overdid it. I'm goin' to tell Anson you're\n",
      "sick now--poisoned or somethin' awful. Then we'll wait till night. Dale\n",
      "shore will help us out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I'm on fire to get away,” she exclaimed. “Jim Wilson, I'll never\n",
      "forget you as long as I live!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed greatly embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal--miss--I--I'll do my best licks. But I ain't gamblin' none on\n",
      "results. Be patient. Keep your nerve. Don't get scared. I reckon between\n",
      "me an' Dale you'll git away from heah.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Withdrawing his head, he got up and returned to the camp-fire, where\n",
      "Anson was waiting curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I left the grub. But she didn't touch it. Seems sort of sick to me,\n",
      "like she was poisoned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, didn't I hear you talkin'?” asked Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. I was coaxin' her. Reckon she ain't so ranty as she was. But she\n",
      "shore is doubled-up, an' sickish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wuss an' wuss all the time,” said Anson, between his teeth. “An'\n",
      "where's Burt? Hyar it's noon an' he left early. He never was no\n",
      "woodsman. He's got lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Either thet or he's run into somethin',” replied Wilson, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson doubled a huge fist and cursed deep under his breath--the reaction\n",
      "of a man whose accomplices and partners and tools, whose luck, whose\n",
      "faith in himself had failed him. He flung himself down under a tree, and\n",
      "after a while, when his rigidity relaxed, he probably fell asleep. Moze\n",
      "and Shady kept at their game. Wilson paced to and fro, sat down, and\n",
      "then got up to bunch the horses again, walked around the dell and back\n",
      "to camp. The afternoon hours were long. And they were waiting hours. The\n",
      "act of waiting appeared on the surface of all these outlaws did.\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunset the golden gloom of the glen changed to a vague, thick\n",
      "twilight. Anson rolled over, yawned, and sat up. As he glanced around,\n",
      "evidently seeking Burt, his face clouded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No sign of Burt?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson expressed a mild surprise. “Wal, Snake, you ain't expectin' Burt\n",
      "now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am, course I am. Why not?” demanded Anson. “Any other time we'd look\n",
      "fer him, wouldn't we?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any other time ain't now.... Burt won't ever come back!” Wilson spoke\n",
      "it with a positive finality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Some more of them queer feelin's of yourn--operatin' again, hey?\n",
      "Them onnatural kind thet you can't explain, hey?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's queries were bitter and rancorous.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. An', Snake, I tax you with this heah. Ain't any of them queer\n",
      "feelin's operatin' in you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” rolled out the leader, savagely. But his passionate denial was a\n",
      "proof that he lied. From the moment of this outburst, which was a fierce\n",
      "clinging to the old, brave instincts of his character, unless a sudden\n",
      "change marked the nature of his fortunes, he would rapidly deteriorate\n",
      "to the breaking-point. And in such brutal, unrestrained natures as his\n",
      "this breaking-point meant a desperate stand, a desperate forcing of\n",
      "events, a desperate accumulation of passions that stalked out to deal\n",
      "and to meet disaster and blood and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson put a little wood on the fire and he munched a biscuit. No one\n",
      "asked him to cook. No one made any effort to do so. One by one each man\n",
      "went to the pack to get some bread and meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they waited as men who knew not what they waited for, yet hated and\n",
      "dreaded it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twilight in that glen was naturally a strange, veiled condition of the\n",
      "atmosphere. It was a merging of shade and light, which two seemed to\n",
      "make gray, creeping shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a snorting and stamping of the horses startled the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somethin' scared the hosses,” said Anson, rising. “Come on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze accompanied him, and they disappeared in the gloom. More trampling\n",
      "of hoofs was heard, then a cracking of brush, and the deep voices of\n",
      "men. At length the two outlaws returned, leading three of the horses,\n",
      "which they haltered in the open glen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camp-fire light showed Anson's face dark and serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, them hosses are wilder 'n deer,” he said. “I ketched mine, an'\n",
      "Moze got two. But the rest worked away whenever we come close. Some\n",
      "varmint has scared them bad. We all gotta rustle out thar quick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson rose, shaking his head doubtfully. And at that moment the quiet\n",
      "air split to a piercing, horrid neigh of a terrified horse. Prolonged to\n",
      "a screech, it broke and ended. Then followed snorts of fright, pound and\n",
      "crack and thud of hoofs, and crash of brush; then a gathering thumping,\n",
      "crashing roar, split by piercing sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stampede!” yelled Anson, and he ran to hold his own horse, which he had\n",
      "haltered right in camp. It was big and wild-looking, and now reared and\n",
      "plunged to break away. Anson just got there in time, and then it took\n",
      "all his weight to pull the horse down. Not until the crashing, snorting,\n",
      "pounding melee had subsided and died away over the rim of the glen did\n",
      "Anson dare leave his frightened favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone! Our horses are gone! Did you hear 'em?” he exclaimed, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. They're a cut-up an' crippled bunch by now,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, we'll never git 'ern back, not 'n a hundred years,” declared\n",
      "Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet settles us, Snake Anson,” stridently added Shady Jones. “Them\n",
      "hosses are gone! You can kiss your hand to them.... They wasn't hobbled.\n",
      "They hed an orful scare. They split on thet stampede an' they'll never\n",
      "git together. ... See what you've fetched us to!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the force of this triple arraignment the outlaw leader dropped to\n",
      "his seat, staggered and silenced. In fact, silence fell upon all the men\n",
      "and likewise enfolded the glen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night set in jet-black, dismal, lonely, without a star. Faintly the wind\n",
      "moaned. Weirdly the brook babbled through its strange chords to end in\n",
      "the sound that was hollow. It was never the same--a rumble, as if faint,\n",
      "distant thunder--a deep gurgle, as of water drawn into a vortex--a\n",
      "rolling, as of a stone in swift current. The black cliff was invisible,\n",
      "yet seemed to have many weird faces; the giant pines loomed spectral;\n",
      "the shadows were thick, moving, changing. Flickering lights from the\n",
      "camp-fire circled the huge trunks and played fantastically over the\n",
      "brooding men. This camp-fire did not burn or blaze cheerily; it had no\n",
      "glow, no sputter, no white heart, no red, living embers. One by one the\n",
      "outlaws, as if with common consent, tried their hands at making the fire\n",
      "burn aright. What little wood had been collected was old; it would burn\n",
      "up with false flare, only to die quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while not one of the outlaws spoke or stirred. Not one smoked.\n",
      "Their gloomy eyes were fixed on the fire. Each one was concerned with\n",
      "his own thoughts, his own lonely soul unconsciously full of a doubt of\n",
      "the future. That brooding hour severed him from comrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "At night nothing seemed the same as it was by day. With success and\n",
      "plenty, with full-blooded action past and more in store, these outlaws\n",
      "were as different from their present state as this black night was\n",
      "different from the bright day they waited for. Wilson, though he played\n",
      "a deep game of deceit for the sake of the helpless girl--and thus did\n",
      "not have haunting and superstitious fears on her account--was probably\n",
      "more conscious of impending catastrophe than any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evil they had done spoke in the voice of nature, out of the\n",
      "darkness, and was interpreted by each according to his hopes and fears.\n",
      "Fear was their predominating sense. For years they had lived with some\n",
      "species of fear--of honest men or vengeance, of pursuit, of starvation,\n",
      "of lack of drink or gold, of blood and death, of stronger men, of luck,\n",
      "of chance, of fate, of mysterious nameless force. Wilson was the type of\n",
      "fearless spirit, but he endured the most gnawing and implacable fear of\n",
      "all--that of himself--that he must inevitably fall to deeds beneath his\n",
      "manhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they hunched around the camp-fire, brooding because hope was at\n",
      "lowest ebb; listening because the weird, black silence, with its moan\n",
      "of wind and hollow laugh of brook, compelled them to hear; waiting for\n",
      "sleep, for the hours to pass, for whatever was to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was Anson who caught the first intimation of an impending doom.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXIII\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson whispered tensely. His poise was motionless, his eyes roved\n",
      "everywhere. He held up a shaking, bludgy finger, to command silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third and stranger sound accompanied the low, weird moan of the wind,\n",
      "and the hollow mockery of the brook--and it seemed a barely perceptible,\n",
      "exquisitely delicate wail or whine. It filled in the lulls between the\n",
      "other sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If thet's some varmint he's close,” whispered Anson.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Shady Jones and Moze divided their opinions in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "All breathed freer when the wail ceased, relaxing to their former\n",
      "lounging positions around the fire. An impenetrable wall of blackness\n",
      "circled the pale space lighted by the camp-fire; and this circle\n",
      "contained the dark, somber group of men in the center, the dying\n",
      "camp-fire, and a few spectral trunks of pines and the tethered horses on\n",
      "the outer edge. The horses scarcely moved from their tracks, and their\n",
      "erect, alert heads attested to their sensitiveness to the peculiarities\n",
      "of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, at an unusually quiet lull the strange sound gradually arose to a\n",
      "wailing whine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's thet crazy wench cryin',” declared the outlaw leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently his allies accepted that statement with as much relief as\n",
      "they had expressed for the termination of the sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, thet must be it,” agreed Jim Wilson, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll git a lot of sleep with thet gurl whinin' all night,” growled\n",
      "Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She gives me the creeps,” said Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson got up to resume his pondering walk, head bent, hands behind his\n",
      "back, a grim, realistic figure of perturbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--set down. You make me nervous,” said Anson, irritably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson actually laughed, but low, as if to keep his strange mirth well\n",
      "confined.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, I'll bet you my hoss an' my gun ag'in' a biscuit thet in aboot\n",
      "six seconds more or less I'll be stampedin like them hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's lean jaw dropped. The other two outlaws stared with round\n",
      "eyes. Wilson was not drunk, they evidently knew; but what he really was\n",
      "appeared a mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim Wilson, are you showin' yellow?” queried Anson, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe. The Lord only knows. But listen heah.... Snake, you've seen an'\n",
      "heard people croak?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Shore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, yes--a couple or so,” replied Anson, grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you never seen no one die of shock--of an orful scare?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I reckon I never did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have. An' thet's what's ailin' Jim Wilson,” and he resumed his dogged\n",
      "steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson and his two comrades exchanged bewildered glances with one\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Say, what's thet got to do with us hyar? asked Anson, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet gurl is dyin'!” retorted Wilson, in a voice cracking like a whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three outlaws stiffened in their seats, incredulous, yet\n",
      "irresistibly swayed by emotions that stirred to this dark, lonely,\n",
      "ill-omened hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson trudged to the edge of the lighted circle, muttering to himself,\n",
      "and came back again; then he trudged farther, this time almost out\n",
      "of sight, but only to return; the third time he vanished in the\n",
      "impenetrable wall of light. The three men scarcely moved a muscle as\n",
      "they watched the place where he had disappeared. In a few moments he\n",
      "came stumbling back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore she's almost gone,” he said, dismally. “It took my nerve, but\n",
      "I felt of her face.... Thet orful wail is her breath chokin' in her\n",
      "throat.... Like a death-rattle, only long instead of short.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if she's gotta croak it's good she gits it over quick,” replied\n",
      "Anson. “I 'ain't hed sleep fer three nights. ... An' what I need is\n",
      "whisky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, thet's gospel you're spoutin',” remarked Shady Jones, morosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The direction of sound in the glen was difficult to be assured of, but\n",
      "any man not stirred to a high pitch of excitement could have told that\n",
      "the difference in volume of this strange wail must have been caused by\n",
      "different distances and positions. Also, when it was loudest, it was\n",
      "most like a whine. But these outlaws heard with their consciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last it ceased abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson again left the group to be swallowed up by the night. His absence\n",
      "was longer than usual, but he returned hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's daid!” he exclaimed, solemnly. “Thet innocent kid--who never\n",
      "harmed no one--an' who'd make any man better fer seein' her--she's\n",
      "daid!... Anson, you've shore a heap to answer fer when your time comes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's eatin' you?” demanded the leader, angrily. “Her blood ain't on\n",
      "my hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It shore is,” shouted Wilson, shaking his hand at Anson. “An' you'll\n",
      "hev to take your medicine. I felt thet comin' all along. An' I feel some\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw! She's jest gone to sleep,” declared Anson, shaking his long frame\n",
      "as he rose. “Gimme a light.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, you're plumb off to go near a dead gurl thet's jest died crazy,”\n",
      " protested Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Off! Haw! Haw! Who ain't off in this outfit, I'd like to know?” Anson\n",
      "possessed himself of a stick blazing at one and, and with this he\n",
      "stalked off toward the lean-to where the girl was supposed to be dead.\n",
      "His gaunt figure, lighted by the torch, certainly fitted the weird,\n",
      "black surroundings. And it was seen that once near the girl's shelter he\n",
      "proceeded more slowly, until he halted. He bent to peer inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“SHE'S GONE!” he yelled, in harsh, shaken accents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Than the torch burned out, leaving only a red glow. He whirled it about,\n",
      "but the blaze did not rekindle. His comrades, peering intently, lost\n",
      "sight of his tall form and the end of the red-ended stick. Darkness like\n",
      "pitch swallowed him. For a moment no sound intervened. Again the moan of\n",
      "wind, the strange little mocking hollow roar, dominated the place. Then\n",
      "there came a rush of something, perhaps of air, like the soft swishing\n",
      "of spruce branches swinging aside. Dull, thudding footsteps followed it.\n",
      "Anson came running back to the fire. His aspect was wild, his face pale,\n",
      "his eyes were fierce and starting from their sockets. He had drawn his\n",
      "gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did--ye--see er hear--anythin'?” he panted, peering back, then all\n",
      "around, and at last at his man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. An' I shore was lookin' an' listenin',” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, there wasn't nothin',” declared Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ain't so sartin,” said Shady Jones, with doubtful, staring eyes. “I\n",
      "believe I heerd a rustlin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She wasn't there!” ejaculated Anson, in wondering awe. “She's gone!...\n",
      "My torch went out. I couldn't see. An' jest then I felt somethin' was\n",
      "passin'. Fast! I jerked 'round. All was black, an' yet if I didn't see\n",
      "a big gray streak I'm crazier 'n thet gurl. But I couldn't swear to\n",
      "anythin' but a rushin' of wind. I felt thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone!” exclaimed Wilson, in great alarm. “Fellars, if thet's so, then\n",
      "mebbe she wasn't daid an' she wandered off. ... But she was daid! Her\n",
      "heart hed quit beatin'. I'll swear to thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I move to break camp,” said Shady Jones, gruffly, and he stood up. Moze\n",
      "seconded that move by an expressive flash of his black visage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, if she's dead--an' gone--what 'n hell's come off?” huskily asked\n",
      "Anson. “It, only seems thet way. We're all worked up.... Let's talk\n",
      "sense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anson, shore there's a heap you an' me don't know,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "“The world come to an end once. Wal, it can come to another end.... I\n",
      "tell you I ain't surprised--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“THAR!” cried Anson, whirling, with his gun leaping out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something huge, shadowy, gray against the black rushed behind the men\n",
      "and trees; and following it came a perceptible acceleration of the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, Snake, there wasn't nothin',” said Wilson, “presently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heerd,” whispered Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was only a breeze blowin' thet smoke,” rejoined Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd bet my soul somethin' went back of me,” declared Anson, glaring\n",
      "into the void.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen an' let's make shore,” suggested Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guilty, agitated faces of the outlaws showed plain enough in the\n",
      "flickering light for each to see a convicting dread in his fellow. Like\n",
      "statues they stood, watching and listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few sounds stirred in the strange silence. Now and then the horses\n",
      "heaved heavily, but stood still; a dismal, dreary note of the wind in\n",
      "the pines vied with a hollow laugh of the brook. And these low sounds\n",
      "only fastened attention upon the quality of the silence. A breathing,\n",
      "lonely spirit of solitude permeated the black dell. Like a pit of\n",
      "unplumbed depths the dark night yawned. An evil conscience, listening\n",
      "there, could have heard the most peaceful, beautiful, and mournful\n",
      "sounds of nature only as strains of a calling hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the silent, oppressive, surcharged air split to a short,\n",
      "piercing scream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's big horse stood up straight, pawing the air, and came down with\n",
      "a crash. The other horses shook with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't--thet--a cougar?” whispered Anson, thickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet was a woman's scream,” replied Wilson, and he appeared to be\n",
      "shaking like a leaf in the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then--I figgered right--the kid's alive--wonderin' around--an' she let\n",
      "out thet orful scream,” said Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wonderin' 'round, yes--but she's daid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Gawd! it ain't possible!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if she ain't wonderin' round daid she's almost daid,” replied\n",
      "Wilson. And he began to whisper to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I'd only knowed what thet deal meant I'd hev plugged Beasley instead\n",
      "of listenin'.... An' I ought to hev knocked thet kid on the head an'\n",
      "made sartin she'd croaked. If she goes screamin' 'round thet way--”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice failed as there rose a thin, splitting, high-pointed shriek,\n",
      "somewhat resembling the first scream, only less wild. It came apparently\n",
      "from the cliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "From another point in the pitch-black glen rose the wailing, terrible\n",
      "cry of a woman in agony. Wild, haunting, mournful wail!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's horse, loosing the halter, plunged back, almost falling over a\n",
      "slight depression in the rocky ground. The outlaw caught him and dragged\n",
      "him nearer the fire. The other horses stood shaking and straining. Moze\n",
      "ran between them and held them. Shady Jones threw green brush on the\n",
      "fire. With sputter and crackle a blaze started, showing Wilson standing\n",
      "tragically, his arms out, facing the black shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strange, live shriek was not repeated. But the cry, like that of\n",
      "a woman in her death-throes, pierced the silence again. It left a\n",
      "quivering ring that softly died away. Then the stillness clamped down\n",
      "once more and the darkness seemed to thicken. The men waited, and when\n",
      "they had begun to relax the cry burst out appallingly close, right\n",
      "behind the trees. It was human--the personification of pain and\n",
      "terror--the tremendous struggle of precious life against horrible death.\n",
      "So pure, so exquisite, so wonderful was the cry that the listeners\n",
      "writhed as if they saw an innocent, tender, beautiful girl torn\n",
      "frightfully before their eyes. It was full of suspense; it thrilled\n",
      "for death; its marvelous potency was the wild note--that beautiful and\n",
      "ghastly note of self-preservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sheer desperation the outlaw leader fired his gun at the black wall\n",
      "whence the cry came. Then he had to fight his horse to keep him from\n",
      "plunging away. Following the shot was an interval of silence; the horses\n",
      "became tractable; the men gathered closer to the fire, with the halters\n",
      "still held firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it was a cougar--thet 'd scare him off,” said Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, but it ain't a cougar,” replied Wilson. “Wait an' see!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all waited, listening with ears turned to different points, eyes\n",
      "roving everywhere, afraid of their very shadows. Once more the moan of\n",
      "wind, the mockery of brook, deep gurgle, laugh and babble, dominated the\n",
      "silence of the glen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, let's shake this spooky hole,” whispered Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion attracted Anson, and he pondered it while slowly shaking\n",
      "his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We've only three hosses. An' mine 'll take ridin'--after them squalls,”\n",
      " replied the leader. “We've got packs, too. An' hell 'ain't nothin' on\n",
      "this place fer bein' dark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter. Let's go. I'll walk an' lead the way,” said Moze, eagerly.\n",
      "“I got sharp eyes. You fellars can ride an' carry a pack. We'll git out\n",
      "of here an' come back in daylight fer the rest of the outfit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anson, I'm keen fer thet myself,” declared Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, what d'ye say to thet?” queried Anson. “Rustlin' out of this black\n",
      "hole?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's a grand idee,” agreed Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet was a cougar,” avowed Anson, gathering courage as the silence\n",
      "remained unbroken. “But jest the same it was as tough on me as if it hed\n",
      "been a woman screamin' over a blade twistin' in her gizzards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, shore you seen a woman heah lately?” deliberately asked Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I did. Thet kid,” replied Anson, dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you seen her go crazy, didn't you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“'An' she wasn't heah when you went huntin' fer her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Correct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if thet's so, what do you want to blab about cougars for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's argument seemed incontestable. Shady and Moze nodded gloomily\n",
      "and shifted restlessly from foot to foot. Anson dropped his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter--if we only don't hear--” he began, suddenly to grow mute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right upon them, from some place, just out the circle of light, rose a\n",
      "scream, by reason of its proximity the most piercing and agonizing yet\n",
      "heard, simply petrifying the group until the peal passed. Anson's huge\n",
      "horse reared, and with a snort of terror lunged in tremendous leap,\n",
      "straight out. He struck Anson with thudding impact, knocking him over\n",
      "the rocks into the depression back of the camp-fire, and plunging after\n",
      "him. Wilson had made a flying leap just in time to avoid being struck,\n",
      "and he turned to see Anson go down. There came a crash, a groan, and\n",
      "then the strike and pound of hoofs as the horse struggled up. Apparently\n",
      "he had rolled over his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Help, fellars!” yelled Wilson, quick to leap down over the little bank,\n",
      "and in the dim light to grasp the halter. The three men dragged the\n",
      "horse out and securely tied him close to a tree. That done, they\n",
      "peered down into the depression. Anson's form could just barely be\n",
      "distinguished in the gloom. He lay stretched out. Another groan escaped\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'm scared he's hurt,” said Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hoss rolled right on top of him. An' thet hoss's heavy,” declared Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "They got down and knelt beside their leader. In the darkness his face\n",
      "looked dull gray. His breathing was not right.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, old man, you ain't--hurt?” asked Wilson, with a tremor in his\n",
      "voice. Receiving no reply, he said to his comrades, “Lay hold an' we'll\n",
      "heft him up where we can see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three men carefully lifted Anson up on the bank and laid him near\n",
      "the fire in the light. Anson was conscious. His face was ghastly. Blood\n",
      "showed on his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson knelt beside him. The other outlaws stood up, and with one dark\n",
      "gaze at one another damned Anson's chance of life. And on the instant\n",
      "rose that terrible distressing scream of acute agony--like that of a\n",
      "woman being dismembered. Shady Jones whispered something to Moze. Then\n",
      "they stood up, gazing down at their fallen leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me where you're hurt?” asked Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He--smashed--my chest,” said Anson, in a broken, strangled whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's deft hands opened the outlaw's shirt and felt of his chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Shore your breast-bone ain't smashed,” replied Wilson, hopefully.\n",
      "And he began to run his hand around one side of Anson's body and then\n",
      "the other. Abruptly he stopped, averted his gaze, then slowly ran the\n",
      "hand all along that side. Anson's ribs had been broken and crushed in\n",
      "by the weight of the horse. He was bleeding at the mouth, and his slow,\n",
      "painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth, which showed that\n",
      "the broken bones had penetrated the lungs. An injury sooner or later\n",
      "fatal!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pard, you busted a rib or two,” said Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Jim--it must be--wuss 'n thet!” he whispered. “I'm--in orful--pain.\n",
      "An' I can't--git any--breath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe you'll be better,” said Wilson, with a cheerfulness his face\n",
      "belied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze bent close over Anson, took a short scrutiny of that ghastly face,\n",
      "at the blood-stained lips, and the lean hands plucking at nothing. Then\n",
      "he jerked erect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shady, he's goin' to cash. Let's clear out of this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm yours pertickler previous,” replied Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both turned away. They untied the two horses and led them up to where\n",
      "the saddles lay. Swiftly the blankets went on, swiftly the saddles\n",
      "swung up, swiftly the cinches snapped. Anson lay gazing up at Wilson,\n",
      "comprehending this move. And Wilson stood strangely grim and silent,\n",
      "somehow detached coldly from that self of the past few hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shady, you grab some bread an' I'll pack a bunk of meat,” said Moze.\n",
      "Both men came near the fire, into the light, within ten feet of where\n",
      "the leader lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fellars--you ain't--slopin'?” he whispered, in husky amaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, we air thet same. We can't do you no good an' this hole ain't\n",
      "healthy,” replied Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones swung himself astride his horse, all about him sharp, eager,\n",
      "strung.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Moze, I'll tote the grub an' you lead out of hyar, till we git past the\n",
      "wust timber,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Moze--you wouldn't leave--Jim hyar--alone,” implored Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim can stay till he rots,” retorted Moze. “I've hed enough of this\n",
      "hole.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Moze--it ain't square--” panted Anson. “Jim wouldn't--leave me.\n",
      "I'd stick--by you.... I'll make it--all up to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, you're goin' to cash,” sardonically returned Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "A current leaped all through Anson's stretched frame. His ghastly face\n",
      "blazed. That was the great and the terrible moment which for long had\n",
      "been in abeyance. Wilson had known grimly that it would come, by one\n",
      "means or another. Anson had doggedly and faithfully struggled against\n",
      "the tide of fatal issues. Moze and Shady Jones, deep locked in their\n",
      "self-centered motives, had not realized the inevitable trend of their\n",
      "dark lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson, prostrate as he was, swiftly drew his gun and shot Moze. Without\n",
      "sound or movement of hand Moze fell. Then the plunge of Shady's horse\n",
      "caused Anson's second shot to miss. A quick third shot brought no\n",
      "apparent result but Shady's cursing resort to his own weapon. He tried\n",
      "to aim from his plunging horse. His bullets spattered dust and gravel\n",
      "over Anson. Then Wilson's long arm stretched and his heavy gun banged.\n",
      "Shady collapsed in the saddle, and the frightened horse, throwing him,\n",
      "plunged out of the circle of light. Thudding hoofs, crashings of brush,\n",
      "quickly ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--did you--git him?” whispered Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore did, Snake,” was the slow, halting response. Jim Wilson must have\n",
      "sustained a sick shudder as he replied. Sheathing his gun, he folded a\n",
      "blanket and put it under Anson's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--my feet--air orful cold,” whispered Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, it's gittin' chilly,” replied Wilson, and, taking a second\n",
      "blanket, he laid that over Anson's limbs. “Snake, I'm feared Shady hit\n",
      "you once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! But not so I'd care--much--if I hed--no wuss hurt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You lay still now. Reckon Shady's hoss stopped out heah a ways. An'\n",
      "I'll see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--I 'ain't heerd--thet scream fer--a little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's gone.... Reckon now thet was a cougar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knowed it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson stalked away into the darkness. That inky wall did not seem so\n",
      "impenetrable and black after he had gotten out of the circle of light.\n",
      "He proceeded carefully and did not make any missteps. He groped from\n",
      "tree to tree toward the cliff and presently brought up against a huge\n",
      "flat rock as high as his head. Here the darkness was blackest, yet he\n",
      "was able to see a light form on the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, are you there--all right?” he called, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but I'm scared to death,” she whispered in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it wound up sudden. Come now. I reckon your trouble's over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He helped her off the rock, and, finding her unsteady on her feet, he\n",
      "supported her with one arm and held the other out in front of him to\n",
      "feel for objects. Foot by foot they worked out from under the dense\n",
      "shadow of the cliff, following the course of the little brook. It\n",
      "babbled and gurgled, and almost drowned the low whistle Wilson sent out.\n",
      "The girl dragged heavily upon him now, evidently weakening. At length he\n",
      "reached the little open patch at the head of the ravine. Halting here,\n",
      "he whistled. An answer came from somewhere behind him and to the right.\n",
      "Wilson waited, with the girl hanging on his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale's heah,” he said. “An' don't you keel over now--after all the\n",
      "nerve you hed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A swishing of brush, a step, a soft, padded footfall; a looming, dark\n",
      "figure, and a long, low gray shape, stealthily moving--it was the last\n",
      "of these that made Wilson jump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson!” came Dale's subdued voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heah. I've got her, Dale. Safe an sound,” replied Wilson, stepping\n",
      "toward the tall form. And he put the drooping girl into Dale's arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! Bo! You're all right?” Dale's deep voice was tremulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "She roused up to seize him and to utter little cries of joy\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Dale!... Oh, thank Heaven! I'm ready to drop now.... Hasn't it been\n",
      "a night--an adventure?... I'm well--safe--sound.... Dale, we owe it to\n",
      "this Jim Wilson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I--we'll all thank him--all our lives,” replied Dale. “Wilson,\n",
      "you're a man!... If you'll shake that gang--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, shore there ain't much of a gang left, onless you let Burt git\n",
      "away,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn't kill him--or hurt him. But I scared him so I'll bet he's\n",
      "runnin' yet.... Wilson, did all the shootin' mean a fight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tolerable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Dale, it was terrible! I saw it all. I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Miss, you can tell him after I go.... I'm wishin' you good luck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice was a cool, easy drawl, slightly tremulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl's face flashed white in the gloom. She pressed against the\n",
      "outlaw--wrung his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heaven help you, Jim Wilson! You ARE from Texas!... I'll remember\n",
      "you--pray for you all my life!”\n",

      "CHAPTER XXIV\n",
      "\n",
      "As Helen Rayner watched Dale ride away on a quest perilous to him, and\n",
      "which meant almost life or death for her, it was surpassing strange that\n",
      "she could think of nothing except the thrilling, tumultuous moment when\n",
      "she had put her arms round his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not matter that Dale--splendid fellow that he was--had made\n",
      "the ensuing moment free of shame by taking her action as he had taken\n",
      "it--the fact that she had actually done it was enough. How utterly\n",
      "impossible for her to anticipate her impulses or to understand them,\n",
      "once they were acted upon! Confounding realization then was that when\n",
      "Dale returned with her sister, Helen knew she would do the same thing\n",
      "over again!\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I do--I won't be two-faced about it,” she soliloquized, and a hot\n",
      "blush flamed her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "She watched Dale until he rode out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had gone, worry and dread replaced this other confusing emotion.\n",
      "She turned to the business of meeting events. Before supper she packed\n",
      "her valuables and books, papers, and clothes, together with Bo's, and\n",
      "had them in readiness so if she was forced to vacate the premises she\n",
      "would have her personal possessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mormon boys and several other of her trusted men slept in their\n",
      "tarpaulin beds on the porch of the ranch-house that night, so that Helen\n",
      "at least would not be surprised. But the day came, with its manifold\n",
      "duties undisturbed by any event. And it passed slowly with the leaden\n",
      "feet of listening, watching vigilance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael did not come back, nor was there news of him to be had. The\n",
      "last known of him had been late the afternoon of the preceding day, when\n",
      "a sheep-herder had seen him far out on the north range, headed for the\n",
      "hills. The Beemans reported that Roy's condition had improved, and also\n",
      "that there was a subdued excitement of suspense down in the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second lonely night was almost unendurable for Helen. When she\n",
      "slept it was to dream horrible dreams; when she lay awake it was to have\n",
      "her heart leap to her throat at a rustle of leaves near the window, and\n",
      "to be in torture of imagination as to poor Bo's plight. A thousand times\n",
      "Helen said to herself that Beasley could have had the ranch and welcome,\n",
      "if only Bo had been spared. Helen absolutely connected her enemy with\n",
      "her sister's disappearance. Riggs might have been a means to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight was not attended by so many fears; there were things to do\n",
      "that demanded attention. And thus it was that the next morning, shortly\n",
      "before noon, she was recalled to her perplexities by a shouting out at\n",
      "the corrals and a galloping of horses somewhere near. From the window\n",
      "she saw a big smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fire! That must be one of the barns--the old one, farthest out,”\n",
      " she said, gazing out of the window. “Some careless Mexican with his\n",
      "everlasting cigarette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen resisted an impulse to go out and see what had happened. She had\n",
      "decided to stay in the house. But when footsteps sounded on the porch\n",
      "and a rap on the door, she unhesitatingly opened it. Four Mexicans stood\n",
      "close. One of them, quick as thought, flashed a hand in to grasp her,\n",
      "and in a single motion pulled her across the threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No hurt, Senora,” he said, and pointed--making motions she must go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen did not need to be told what this visit meant. Many as her\n",
      "conjectures had been, however, she had not thought of Beasley subjecting\n",
      "her to this outrage. And her blood boiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dare you!” she said, trembling in her effort to control her temper.\n",
      "But class, authority, voice availed nothing with these swarthy Mexicans.\n",
      "They grinned. Another laid hold of Helen with dirty, brown hand. She\n",
      "shrank from the contact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let go!” she burst out, furiously. And instinctively she began to\n",
      "struggle to free herself. Then they all took hold of her. Helen's\n",
      "dignity might never have been! A burning, choking rush of blood was\n",
      "her first acquaintance with the terrible passion of anger that was her\n",
      "inheritance from the Auchinclosses. She who had resolved never to lay\n",
      "herself open to indignity now fought like a tigress. The Mexicans,\n",
      "jabbering in their excitement, had all they could do, until they\n",
      "lifted her bodily from the porch. They handled her as if she had been a\n",
      "half-empty sack of corn. One holding each hand and foot they packed her,\n",
      "with dress disarranged and half torn off, down the path to the lane and\n",
      "down the lane to the road. There they stood upright and pushed her off\n",
      "her property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through half-blind eyes Helen saw them guarding the gateway, ready to\n",
      "prevent her entrance. She staggered down the road to the village.\n",
      "It seemed she made her way through a red dimness--that there was a\n",
      "congestion in her brain--that the distance to Mrs. Cass's cottage was\n",
      "insurmountable. But she got there, to stagger up the path, to hear the\n",
      "old woman's cry. Dizzy, faint, sick, with a blackness enveloping all she\n",
      "looked at, Helen felt herself led into the sitting-room and placed in\n",
      "the big chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently sight and clearness of mind returned to her. She saw Roy,\n",
      "white as a sheet, questioning her with terrible eyes. The old woman\n",
      "hung murmuring over her, trying to comfort her as well as fasten the\n",
      "disordered dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four greasers--packed me down--the hill--threw me off my ranch--into\n",
      "the road!” panted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed to tell this also to her own consciousness and to realize the\n",
      "mighty wave of danger that shook her whole body.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I'd known--I would have killed them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She exclaimed that, full-voiced and hard, with dry, hot eyes on her\n",
      "friends. Roy reached out to take her hand, speaking huskily. Helen\n",
      "did not distinguish what he said. The frightened old woman knelt, with\n",
      "unsteady fingers fumbling over the rents in Helen's dress. The moment\n",
      "came when Helen's quivering began to subside, when her blood quieted\n",
      "to let her reason sway, when she began to do battle with her rage, and\n",
      "slowly to take fearful stock of this consuming peril that had been a\n",
      "sleeping tigress in her veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Miss Helen, you looked so turrible, I made sure you was hurted,”\n",
      " the old woman was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed strangely at her bruised wrists, at the one stocking that\n",
      "hung down over her shoe-top, at the rent which had bared her shoulder to\n",
      "the profane gaze of those grinning, beady-eyed Mexicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My body's--not hurt,” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy had lost some of his whiteness, and where his eyes had been fierce\n",
      "they were now kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Miss Nell, it's lucky no harm's done.... Now if you'll only see\n",
      "this whole deal clear!... Not let it spoil your sweet way of lookin' an'\n",
      "hopin'! If you can only see what's raw in this West--an' love it jest\n",
      "the same!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen only half divined his meaning, but that was enough for a future\n",
      "reflection. The West was beautiful, but hard. In the faces of these\n",
      "friends she began to see the meaning of the keen, sloping lines, and\n",
      "shadows of pain, of a lean, naked truth, cut as from marble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the land's sakes, tell us all about it,” importuned Mrs. Cass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Helen shut her eyes and told the brief narrative of her\n",
      "expulsion from her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore we-all expected thet,” said Roy. “An' it's jest as well you're\n",

      "all sooner hev you away from thet ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Roy, I won't let Beasley stay there,” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",

      "law you'll hev gray in thet pretty hair. You can't put Beasley off with\n",
      "your honest an' rightful claim. Al Auchincloss was a hard driver. He\n",
      "made enemies an' he made some he didn't kill. The evil men do lives\n",
      "after them. An' you've got to suffer fer Al's sins, though Al was as\n",

      "“Oh, what can I do? I won't give up. I've been robbed. Can't the people\n",

      "“I'll try to be brave, but--but I must be prepared,” she replied,\n",
      "tremulously.\n",

      "“Reckon you'll only begin to care when thet happens. Your big hunter has\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before noon that day the baggage Helen had packed at home was left on\n",
      "the porch of Widow Cass's cottage, and Helen's anxious need of the hour\n",
      "was satisfied. She was made comfortable in the old woman's one spare\n",
      "room, and she set herself the task of fortitude and endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her surprise, many of Mrs. Cass's neighbors came unobtrusively to\n",
      "the back door of the little cottage and made sympathetic inquiries. They\n",
      "appeared a subdued and apprehensive group, and whispered to one another\n",
      "as they left. Helen gathered from their visits a conviction that the\n",
      "wives of the men dominated by Beasley believed no good could come of\n",
      "this high-handed taking over of the ranch. Indeed, Helen found at the\n",
      "end of the day that a strength had been borne of her misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Roy informed her that his brother John had come down the\n",
      "preceding night with the news of Beasley's descent upon the ranch. Not a\n",
      "shot had been fired, and the only damage done was that of the burning of\n",
      "a hay-filled barn. This had been set on fire to attract Helen's men to\n",
      "one spot, where Beasley had ridden down upon them with three times their\n",
      "number. He had boldly ordered them off the land, unless they wanted to\n",
      "acknowledge him boss and remain there in his service. The three Beemans\n",
      "had stayed, having planned that just in this event they might be\n",
      "valuable to Helen's interests. Beasley had ridden down into Pine the\n",
      "same as upon any other day. Roy reported also news which had come in\n",
      "that morning, how Beasley's crowd had celebrated late the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second and third and fourth days endlessly wore away, and Helen\n",
      "believed they had made her old. At night she lay awake most of the time,\n",
      "thinking and praying, but during the afternoon she got some sleep. She\n",
      "could think of nothing and talk of nothing except her sister, and Dale's\n",
      "chances of saving her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, shore you pay Dale a pore compliment,” finally protested the\n",
      "patient Roy. “I tell you--Milt Dale can do anythin' he wants to do in\n",
      "the woods. You can believe thet. ... But I reckon he'll run chances\n",
      "after he comes back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This significant speech thrilled Helen with its assurance of hope, and\n",

      "\n",
      "On the afternoon of the fifth day Helen was abruptly awakened from her\n",
      "nap. The sun had almost set. She heard voices--the shrill, cackling\n",
      "notes of old Mrs. Cass, high in excitement, a deep voice that made Helen\n",
      "tingle all over, a girl's laugh, broken but happy. There were footsteps\n",
      "and stamping of hoofs. Dale had brought Bo back! Helen knew it. She grew\n",
      "very weak, and had to force herself to stand erect. Her heart began to\n",
      "pound in her very ears. A sweet and perfect joy suddenly flooded her\n",
      "soul. She thanked God her prayers had been answered. Then suddenly alive\n",
      "with sheer mad physical gladness, she rushed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was just in time to see Roy Beeman stalk out as if he had never been\n",
      "shot, and with a yell greet a big, gray-clad, gray-faced man--Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Roy! Glad to see you up,” said Dale. How the quiet voice\n",
      "steadied Helen! She beheld Bo. Bo, looking the same, except a little\n",
      "pale and disheveled! Then Bo saw her and leaped at her, into her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! I'm here! Safe--all right! Never was so happy in my life....\n",
      "Oh-h! talk about your adventures! Nell, you dear old mother to me--I've\n",
      "had e-enough forever!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was wild with joy, and by turns she laughed and cried. But Helen\n",
      "could not voice her feelings. Her eyes were so dim that she could\n",
      "scarcely see Dale when he loomed over her as she held Bo. But he found\n",
      "the hand she put shakily out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!... Reckon it's been harder--on you.” His voice was earnest and\n",
      "halting. She felt his searching gaze upon her face. “Mrs. Cass said you\n",
      "were here. An' I know why.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy led them all indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, one of the neighbor boys will take care of thet hoss,” he said,\n",
      "as Dale turned toward the dusty and weary Ranger. “Where'd you leave the\n",
      "cougar?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sent him home,” replied Date.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laws now, Milt, if this ain't grand!” cackled Mrs. Cass. “We've worried\n",
      "some here. An' Miss Helen near starved a-hopin' fer you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother, I reckon the girl an' I are nearer starved than anybody you\n",
      "know,” replied Dale, with a grim laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fer the land's sake! I'll be fixin' supper this minit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, why are you here?” asked Bo, suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "For answer Helen led her sister into the spare room and closed the door.\n",
      "Bo saw the baggage. Her expression changed. The old blaze leaped to the\n",
      "telltale eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's done it!” she cried, hotly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dearest--thank God. I've got you--back again!” murmured Helen, finding\n",
      "her voice. “Nothing else matters!... I've prayed only for that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good old Nell!” whispered Bo, and she kissed and embraced Helen. “You\n",
      "really mean that, I know. But nix for yours truly! I'm back alive and\n",
      "kicking, you bet.... Where's my--where's Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, not a word has been heard of him for five days. He's searching for\n",
      "you, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you've been--been put off the ranch?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, rather,” replied Helen, and in a few trembling words she told the\n",
      "story of her eviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo uttered a wild word that had more force than elegance, but it became\n",
      "her passionate resentment of this outrage done her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!... Does Tom Carmichael know this?” she added, breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When he finds out, then--Oh, won't there be hell? I'm glad I got here\n",
      "first.... Nell, my boots haven't been off the whole blessed time. Help\n",
      "me. And oh, for some soap and hot water and some clean clothes! Nell,\n",
      "old girl, I wasn't raised right for these Western deals. Too luxurious!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Helen had her ears filled with a rapid-fire account of running\n",
      "horses and Riggs and outlaws and Beasley called boldly to his teeth, and\n",
      "a long ride and an outlaw who was a hero--a fight with Riggs--blood and\n",
      "death--another long ride--a wild camp in black woods--night--lonely,\n",
      "ghostly sounds--and day again--plot--a great actress lost to the\n",
      "world--Ophelia--Snakes and Ansons--hoodooed outlaws--mournful moans\n",
      "and terrible cries--cougar--stampede--fight and shots, more blood and\n",
      "death--Wilson hero--another Tom Carmichael--fallen in love with outlaw\n",
      "gun-fighter if--black night and Dale and horse and rides and starved\n",
      "and, “Oh, Nell, he WAS from Texas!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gathered that wonderful and dreadful events had hung over\n",
      "the bright head of this beloved little sister, but the bewilderment\n",
      "occasioned by Bo's fluent and remarkable utterance left only that last\n",
      "sentence clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Helen got a word in to inform Bo that Mrs. Cass had knocked\n",
      "twice for supper, and that welcome news checked Bo's flow of speech when\n",
      "nothing else seemed adequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was obvious to Helen that Roy and Dale had exchanged stories. Roy\n",
      "celebrated this reunion by sitting at table the first time since he\n",
      "had been shot; and despite Helen's misfortune and the suspended waiting\n",
      "balance in the air the occasion was joyous. Old Mrs. Cass was in the\n",
      "height of her glory. She sensed a romance here, and, true to her sex,\n",
      "she radiated to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight was still lingering when Roy got up and went out on the porch.\n",
      "His keen ears had heard something. Helen fancied she herself had heard\n",
      "rapid hoof-beats.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, come out!” called Roy, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter moved with his swift, noiseless agility. Helen and Bo\n",
      "followed, halting in the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's Las Vegas,” whispered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen it seemed that the cowboy's name changed the very atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voices were heard at the gate; one that, harsh and quick, sounded like\n",
      "Carmichael's. And a spirited horse was pounding and scattering\n",
      "gravel. Then a lithe figure appeared, striding up the path. It was\n",
      "Carmichael--yet not the Carmichael Helen knew. She heard Bo's strange\n",
      "little cry, a corroboration of her own impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy might never have been shot, judging from the way he stepped out,\n",
      "and Dale was almost as quick. Carmichael reached them--grasped them with\n",
      "swift, hard hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boys--I jest rode in. An' they said you'd found her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, Las Vegas. Dale fetched her home safe an' sound.... There she\n",
      "is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy thrust aside the two men, and with a long stride he faced the\n",
      "porch, his piercing eyes on the door. All that Helen could think of his\n",
      "look was that it seemed terrible. Bo stepped outside in front of Helen.\n",
      "Probably she would have run straight into Carmichael's arms if some\n",
      "strange instinct had not withheld her. Helen judged it to be fear; she\n",
      "found her heart lifting painfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo!” he yelled, like a savage, yet he did not in the least resemble\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--Tom!” cried Bo, falteringly. She half held out her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You, girl?” That seemed to be his piercing query, like the quivering\n",
      "blade in his eyes. Two more long strides carried him close up to her,\n",
      "and his look chased the red out of Bo's cheek. Then it was beautiful to\n",
      "see his face marvelously change until it was that of the well remembered\n",
      "Las Vegas magnified in all his old spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” The exclamation was a tremendous sigh. “I shore am glad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That beautiful flash left his face as he wheeled to the men. He wrung\n",
      "Dale's hand long and hard, and his gaze confused the older man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“RIGGS!” he said, and in the jerk of his frame as he whipped out the\n",
      "word disappeared the strange, fleeting signs of his kindlier emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson killed him,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim Wilson--that old Texas Ranger!... Reckon he lent you a hand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, he saved Bo,” replied Dale, with emotion. “My old cougar an'\n",
      "me--we just hung 'round.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You made Wilson help you?” cut in the hard voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. But he killed Riggs before I come up an' I reckon he'd done well\n",
      "by Bo if I'd never got there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How about the gang?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All snuffed out, I reckon, except Wilson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somebody told me Beasley hed ran Miss Helen off the ranch. Thet so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Four of his greasers packed her down the hill--most tore her\n",
      "clothes off, so Roy tells me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four greasers!... Shore it was Beasley's deal clean through?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Riggs was led. He had an itch for a bad name, you know. But\n",
      "Beasley made the plan. It was Nell they wanted instead of Bo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Abruptly Carmichael stalked off down the darkening path, his silver\n",
      "heel-plates ringing, his spurs jingling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, Carmichael,” called Dale, taking a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Tom!” cried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore folks callin' won't be no use, if anythin would be,” said Roy.\n",
      "“Las Vegas has hed a look at red liquor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's been drinking! Oh, that accounts!... he never--never even touched\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "For once Helen was not ready to comfort Bo. A mighty tug at her heart\n",
      "had sent her with flying, uneven steps toward Dale. He took another\n",
      "stride down the path, and another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale--oh--please stop!” she called, very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted as if he had run sharply into a bar across the path. When he\n",
      "turned Helen had come close. Twilight was deep there in the shade of the\n",
      "peach-trees, but she could see his face, the hungry, flaring eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I haven't thanked you--yet--for bringing Bo home,” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, never mind that,” he said, in surprise. “If you must--why, wait.\n",
      "I've got to catch up with that cowboy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Let me thank you now,” she whispered, and, stepping closer, she put\n",
      "her arms up, meaning to put them round his neck. That action must be her\n",
      "self-punishment for the other time she had done it. Yet it might also\n",
      "serve to thank him. But, strangely, her hands got no farther than his\n",
      "breast, and fluttered there to catch hold of the fringe of his buckskin\n",
      "jacket. She felt a heave of his deep chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I do thank you--with all my heart,” she said, softly. “I owe you\n",
      "now--for myself and her--more than I can ever repay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm your friend,” he replied, hurriedly. “Don't talk of repayin'\n",
      "me. Let me go now--after Las Vegas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” she queried, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean to line up beside him--at the bar--or wherever he goes,”\n",
      " returned Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't tell me that. _I_ know. You're going straight to meet Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, if you hold me up any longer I reckon I'll have to run--or never\n",
      "get to Beasley before that cowboy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen locked her fingers in the fringe of his jacket--leaned closer to\n",
      "him, all her being responsive to a bursting gust of blood over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll not let you go,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed, and put his great hands over hers. “What 're you sayin',\n",
      "girl? You can't stop me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I can. Dale, I don't want you to risk your life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared at her, and made as if to tear her hands from their hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen--please--oh--please!” she implored. “If you go deliberately\n",
      "to kill Beasley--and do it--that will be murder.... It's against my\n",
      "religion.... I would be unhappy all my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, child, you'll be ruined all your life if Beasley is not dealt\n",
      "with--as men of his breed are always dealt with in the West,” he\n",
      "remonstrated, and in one quick move he had freed himself from her\n",
      "clutching fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen, with a move as swift, put her arms round his neck and clasped her\n",
      "hands tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I'm finding myself,” she said. “The other day, when I\n",
      "did--this--you made an excuse for me.... I'm not two-faced now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She meant to keep him from killing Beasley if she sacrificed every last\n",
      "shred of her pride. And she stamped the look of his face on her heart\n",
      "of hearts to treasure always. The thrill, the beat of her pulses, almost\n",
      "obstructed her thought of purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, just now--when you're overcome--rash with feelin's--don't say to\n",
      "me--a word--a--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke down huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My first friend--my--Oh Dale, I KNOW you love me! she whispered. And\n",
      "she hid her face on his breast, there to feel a tremendous tumult.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don't you?” she cried, in low, smothered voice, as his silence\n",
      "drove her farther on this mad, yet glorious purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you need to be told--yes--I reckon I do love you, Nell Rayner,” he\n",
      "replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Helen that he spoke from far off. She lifted her face, her\n",
      "heart on her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you kill Beasley I'll never marry you,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's expectin' you to?” he asked, with low, hoarse laugh. “Do you\n",
      "think you have to marry me to square accounts? This's the only time you\n",
      "ever hurt me, Nell Rayner.... I'm 'shamed you could think I'd expect\n",
      "you--out of gratitude--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--you--you are as dense as the forest where you live,” she cried.\n",
      "And then she shut her eyes again, the better to remember that\n",
      "transfiguration of his face, the better to betray herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man--I love you!” Full and deep, yet tremulous, the words burst from\n",
      "her heart that had been burdened with them for many a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it seemed, in the throbbing riot of her senses, that she was\n",
      "lifted and swung into his arms, and handled with a great and terrible\n",
      "tenderness, and hugged and kissed with the hunger and awkwardness of a\n",
      "bear, and held with her feet off the ground, and rendered blind, dizzy,\n",
      "rapturous, and frightened, and utterly torn asunder from her old calm,\n",
      "thinking self.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put her down--released her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothin' could have made me so happy as what you said.” He finished with\n",
      "a strong sigh of unutterable, wondering joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you will not go to--to meet--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's happy query froze on her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've got to go!” he rejoined, with his old, quiet voice. “Hurry in to\n",
      "Bo.... An' don't worry. Try to think of things as I taught you up in the\n",
      "woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen heard his soft, padded footfalls swiftly pass away. She was left\n",
      "there, alone in the darkening twilight, suddenly cold and stricken, as\n",
      "if turned to stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she stood an age-long moment until the upflashing truth galvanized\n",
      "her into action. Then she flew in pursuit of Dale. The truth was that,\n",
      "in spite of Dale's' early training in the East and the long years of\n",
      "solitude which had made him wonderful in thought and feeling, he had\n",
      "also become a part of this raw, bold, and violent West.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite dark now and she had run quite some distance before she saw\n",
      "Dale's tall, dark form against the yellow light of Turner's saloon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow, in that poignant moment, when her flying feet kept pace with\n",
      "her heart, Helen felt in herself a force opposing itself against this\n",
      "raw, primitive justice of the West. She was one of the first influences\n",
      "emanating from civilized life, from law and order. In that flash of\n",
      "truth she saw the West as it would be some future time, when through\n",
      "women and children these wild frontier days would be gone forever. Also,\n",
      "just as clearly she saw the present need of men like Roy Beeman and Dale\n",
      "and the fire-blooded Carmichael. Beasley and his kind must be killed.\n",
      "But Helen did not want her lover, her future husband, and the probable\n",
      "father of her children to commit what she held to be murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the door of the saloon she caught up with Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt--oh--wait!'--wait!” she panted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard him curse under his breath as he turned. They were alone in\n",
      "the yellow flare of light. Horses were champing bits and drooping before\n",
      "the rails.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You go back!” ordered Dale, sternly. His face was pale, his eyes were\n",
      "gleaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! Not till--you take me--or carry me!” she replied, resolutely, with\n",
      "all a woman's positive and inevitable assurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he laid hold of her with ungentle hands. His violence, especially\n",
      "the look on his face, terrified Helen, rendered her weak. But nothing\n",
      "could have shaken her resolve. She felt victory. Her sex, her love, and\n",
      "her presence would be too much for Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he swung Helen around, the low hum of voices inside the saloon\n",
      "suddenly rose to sharp, hoarse roars, accompanied by a scuffling of feet\n",
      "and crashing of violently sliding chairs or tables. Dale let go of Helen\n",
      "and leaped toward the door. But a silence inside, quicker and stranger\n",
      "than the roar, halted him. Helen's heart contracted, then seemed to\n",
      "cease beating. There was absolutely not a perceptible sound. Even the\n",
      "horses appeared, like Dale, to have turned to statues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two thundering shots annihilated this silence. Then quickly came a\n",
      "lighter shot--the smash of glass. Dale ran into the saloon. The horses\n",
      "began to snort, to rear, to pound. A low, muffled murmur terrified Helen\n",
      "even as it drew her. Dashing at the door, she swung it in and entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place was dim, blue-hazed, smelling of smoke. Dale stood just inside\n",
      "the door. On the floor lay two men. Chairs and tables were overturned.\n",
      "A motley, dark, shirt-sleeved, booted, and belted crowd of men appeared\n",
      "hunched against the opposite wall, with pale, set faces, turned to the\n",
      "bar. Turner, the proprietor, stood at one end, his face livid, his hands\n",
      "aloft and shaking. Carmichael leaned against the middle of the bar. He\n",
      "held a gun low down. It was smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a gasp Helen flashed her eyes back to Dale. He had seen her--was\n",
      "reaching an arm toward her. Then she saw the man lying almost at her\n",
      "feet. Jeff Mulvey--her uncle's old foreman! His face was awful to\n",
      "behold. A smoking gun lay near his inert hand. The other man had fallen\n",
      "on his face. His garb proclaimed him a Mexican. He was not yet dead.\n",
      "Then Helen, as she felt Dale's arm encircle her, looked farther, because\n",
      "she could not prevent it--looked on at that strange figure against the\n",
      "bar--this boy who had been such a friend in her hour of need--this naive\n",
      "and frank sweetheart of her sister's.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw a man now--wild, white, intense as fire, with some terrible cool\n",
      "kind of deadliness in his mien. His left elbow rested upon the bar, and\n",
      "his hand held a glass of red liquor. The big gun, low down in his other\n",
      "hand, seemed as steady as if it were a fixture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heah's to thet--half-breed Beasley an' his outfit!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael drank, while his flaming eyes held the crowd; then with\n",
      "savage action of terrible passion he flung the glass at the quivering\n",
      "form of the still living Mexican on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt herself slipping. All seemed to darken around her. She could\n",
      "not see Dale, though she knew he held her. Then she fainted.\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER XXV\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas Carmichael was a product of his day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pan Handle of Texas, the old Chisholm Trail along which were\n",
      "driven the great cattle herds northward, Fort Dodge, where the cowboys\n",
      "conflicted with the card-sharps--these hard places had left their marks\n",
      "on Carmichael. To come from Texas was to come from fighting stock. And\n",
      "a cowboy's life was strenuous, wild, violent, and generally brief. The\n",
      "exceptions were the fortunate and the swiftest men with guns; and they\n",
      "drifted from south to north and west, taking with them the reckless,\n",
      "chivalrous, vitriolic spirit peculiar to their breed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pioneers and ranchers of the frontier would never have made the West\n",
      "habitable had it not been for these wild cowboys, these hard-drinking,\n",
      "hard-riding, hard-living rangers of the barrens, these easy, cool,\n",
      "laconic, simple young men whose blood was tinged with fire and who\n",
      "possessed a magnificent and terrible effrontery toward danger and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas ran his horse from Widow Cass's cottage to Turner's saloon,\n",
      "and the hoofs of the goaded steed crashed in the door. Las Vegas's\n",
      "entrance was a leap. Then he stood still with the door ajar and the\n",
      "horse pounding and snorting back. All the men in that saloon who saw the\n",
      "entrance of Las Vegas knew what it portended. No thunderbolt could\n",
      "have more quickly checked the drinking, gambling, talking crowd. They\n",
      "recognized with kindred senses the nature of the man and his arrival.\n",
      "For a second the blue-hazed room was perfectly quiet, then men breathed,\n",
      "moved, rose, and suddenly caused a quick, sliding crash of chairs and\n",
      "tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy's glittering eyes flashed to and fro, and then fixed on\n",
      "Mulvey and his Mexican companion. That glance singled out these two, and\n",
      "the sudden rush of nervous men proved it. Mulvey and the sheep-herder\n",
      "were left alone in the center of the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Jeff! Where's your boss?” asked Las Vegas. His voice was cool,\n",
      "friendly; his manner was easy, natural; but the look of him was what\n",
      "made Mulvey pale and the Mexican livid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon he's home,” replied Mulvey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Home? What's he call home now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's hangin' out hyar at Auchincloss's,” replied Mulvey. His voice was\n",
      "not strong, but his eyes were steady, watchful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas quivered all over as if stung. A flame that seemed white and\n",
      "red gave his face a singular hue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jeff, you worked for old Al a long time, an' I've heard of your\n",
      "differences,” said Las Vegas. “Thet ain't no mix of mine.... But you\n",
      "double-crossed Miss Helen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mulvey made no attempt to deny this. He gulped slowly. His hands\n",
      "appeared less steady, and he grew paler. Again Las Vegas's words\n",
      "signified less than his look. And that look now included the Mexican.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pedro, you're one of Beasley's old hands,” said Las Vegas, accusingly.\n",
      "“An'--you was one of them four greasers thet--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the cowboy choked and bit over his words as if they were a material\n",
      "poison. The Mexican showed his guilt and cowardice. He began to jabber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shet up!” hissed Las Vegas, with a savage and significant jerk of\n",
      "his arm, as if about to strike. But that action was read for its true\n",
      "meaning. Pell-mell the crowd split to rush each way and leave an open\n",
      "space behind the three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas waited. But Mulvey seemed obstructed. The Mexican looked\n",
      "dangerous through his fear. His fingers twitched as if the tendons\n",
      "running up into his arms were being pulled.\n",
      "\n",
      "An instant of suspense--more than long enough for Mulvey to be tried and\n",
      "found wanting--and Las Vegas, with laugh and sneer, turned his back upon\n",
      "the pair and stepped to the bar. His call for a bottle made Turner jump\n",
      "and hold it out with shaking hands. Las Vegas poured out a drink, while\n",
      "his gaze was intent on the scarred old mirror hanging behind the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This turning his back upon men he had just dared to draw showed what\n",
      "kind of a school Las Vegas had been trained in. If those men had been\n",
      "worthy antagonists of his class he would never have scorned them. As it\n",
      "was, when Mulvey and the Mexican jerked at their guns, Las Vegas swiftly\n",
      "wheeled and shot twice. Mulvey's gun went off as he fell, and the\n",
      "Mexican doubled up in a heap on the floor. Then Las Vegas reached around\n",
      "with his left hand for the drink he had poured out.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture Dale burst into the saloon, suddenly to check his\n",
      "impetus, to swerve aside toward the bar and halt. The door had not\n",
      "ceased swinging when again it was propelled inward, this time to admit\n",
      "Helen Rayner, white and wide-eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment then Las Vegas had spoken his deadly toast to\n",
      "Beasley's gang and had fiercely flung the glass at the writhing Mexican\n",
      "on the floor. Also Dale had gravitated toward the reeling Helen to catch\n",
      "her when she fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas began to curse, and, striding to Dale, he pushed him out of\n",
      "the saloon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“--! What 're you doin' heah?” he yelled, stridently. “Hevn't you got\n",
      "thet girl to think of? Then do it, you big Indian! Lettin' her run after\n",
      "you heah--riskin' herself thet way! You take care of her an' Bo an'\n",
      "leave this deal to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy, furious as he was at Dale, yet had keen, swift eyes for the\n",
      "horses near at hand, and the men out in the dim light. Dale lifted\n",
      "the girl into his arms, and, turning without a word, stalked away to\n",
      "disappear in the darkness. Las Vegas, holding his gun low, returned to\n",
      "the bar-room. If there had been any change in the crowd it was slight.\n",
      "The tension had relaxed. Turner no longer stood with hands up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You-all go on with your fun,” called the cowboy, with a sweep of his\n",
      "gun. “But it'd be risky fer any one to start leavin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he backed against the bar, near where the black bottle stood.\n",
      "Turner walked out to begin righting tables and chairs, and presently the\n",
      "crowd, with some caution and suspense, resumed their games and drinking.\n",
      "It was significant that a wide berth lay between them and the door. From\n",
      "time to time Turner served liquor to men who called for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas leaned with back against the bar. After a while he sheathed\n",
      "his gun and reached around for the bottle. He drank with his piercing\n",
      "eyes upon the door. No one entered and no one went out. The games\n",
      "of chance there and the drinking were not enjoyed. It was a hard\n",
      "scene--that smoky, long, ill-smelling room, with its dim, yellow lights,\n",
      "and dark, evil faces, with the stealthy-stepping Turner passing to and\n",
      "fro, and the dead Mulvey staring in horrible fixidity at the ceiling,\n",
      "and the Mexican quivering more and more until he shook violently, then\n",
      "lay still, and with the drinking, somber, waiting cowboy, more fiery and\n",
      "more flaming with every drink, listening for a step that did not come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed, and what little change it wrought was in the cowboy. Drink\n",
      "affected him, but he did not become drunk. It seemed that the liquor he\n",
      "drank was consumed by a mounting fire. It was fuel to a driving passion.\n",
      "He grew more sullen, somber, brooding, redder of eye and face, more\n",
      "crouching and restless. At last, when the hour was so late that there\n",
      "was no probability of Beasley appearing, Las Vegas flung himself out of\n",
      "the saloon.\n",
      "\n",
      "All lights of the village had now been extinguished. The tired horses\n",
      "drooped in the darkness. Las Vegas found his horse and led him away down\n",
      "the road and out a lane to a field where a barn stood dim and dark in\n",
      "the starlight. Morning was not far off. He unsaddled the horse and,\n",
      "turning him loose, went into the barn. Here he seemed familiar with\n",
      "his surroundings, for he found a ladder and climbed to a loft, where he\n",
      "threw himself on the hay.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rested, but did not sleep. At daylight he went down and brought his\n",
      "horse into the barn. Sunrise found Las Vegas pacing to and fro the short\n",
      "length of the interior, and peering out through wide cracks between\n",
      "the boards. Then during the succeeding couple of hours he watched\n",
      "the occasional horseman and wagon and herder that passed on into the\n",
      "village.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the breakfast hour Las Vegas saddled his horse and rode back the\n",
      "way he had come the night before. At Turner's he called for something\n",
      "to eat as well as for whisky. After that he became a listening, watching\n",
      "machine. He drank freely for an hour; then he stopped. He seemed to\n",
      "be drunk, but with a different kind of drunkenness from that usual in\n",
      "drinking men. Savage, fierce, sullen, he was one to avoid. Turner waited\n",
      "on him in evident fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Las Vegas's condition became such that action was involuntary.\n",
      "He could not stand still nor sit down. Stalking out, he passed the\n",
      "store, where men slouched back to avoid him, and he went down the road,\n",
      "wary and alert, as if he expected a rifle-shot from some hidden enemy.\n",
      "Upon his return down that main thoroughfare of the village not a person\n",
      "was to be seen. He went in to Turner's. The proprietor was there at his\n",
      "post, nervous and pale. Las Vegas did not order any more liquor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turner, I reckon I'll bore you next time I run in heah,” he said, and\n",
      "stalked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had the stores, the road, the village, to himself; and he patrolled a\n",
      "beat like a sentry watching for an Indian attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward noon a single man ventured out into the road to accost the\n",
      "cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I'm tellin' you--all the greasers air leavin' the range,” he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Abe!” replied Las Vegas. “What 'n hell you talkin' about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man repeated his information. And Las Vegas spat out frightful\n",
      "curses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Abe--you heah what Beasley's doin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. He's with his men--up at the ranch. Reckon he can't put off ridin'\n",
      "down much longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was where the West spoke. Beasley would be forced to meet the enemy\n",
      "who had come out single-handed against him. Long before this hour a\n",
      "braver man would have come to face Las Vegas. Beasley could not hire\n",
      "any gang to bear the brunt of this situation. This was the test by which\n",
      "even his own men must judge him. All of which was to say that as the\n",
      "wildness of the West had made possible his crimes, so it now held him\n",
      "responsible for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Abe, if thet--greaser don't rustle down heah I'm goin' after him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. But don't be in no hurry,” replied Abe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm waltzin' to slow music.... Gimme a smoke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With fingers that slightly trembled Abe rolled a cigarette, lit it from\n",
      "his own, and handed it to the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I reckon I hear hosses,” he said, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me, too,” replied Las Vegas, with his head high like that of a\n",
      "listening deer. Apparently he forgot the cigarette and also his friend.\n",
      "Abe hurried back to the store, where he disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas began his stalking up and down, and his action now was an\n",
      "exaggeration of all his former movements. A rational, ordinary mortal\n",
      "from some Eastern community, happening to meet this red-faced cowboy,\n",
      "would have considered him drunk or crazy. Probably Las Vegas looked\n",
      "both. But all the same he was a marvelously keen and strung and\n",
      "efficient instrument to meet the portending issue. How many thousands of\n",
      "times, on the trails, and in the wide-streeted little towns all over the\n",
      "West, had this stalk of the cowboy's been perpetrated! Violent, bloody,\n",
      "tragic as it was, it had an importance in that pioneer day equal to the\n",
      "use of a horse or the need of a plow.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Pine was apparently a deserted village, except for Las Vegas,\n",
      "who patrolled his long beat in many ways--he lounged while he\n",
      "watched; he stalked like a mountaineer; he stole along Indian fashion,\n",
      "stealthily, from tree to tree, from corner to corner; he disappeared in\n",
      "the saloon to reappear at the back; he slipped round behind the barns to\n",
      "come out again in the main road; and time after time he approached his\n",
      "horse as if deciding to mount.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last visit he made into Turner's saloon he found no one there.\n",
      "Savagely he pounded on the bar with his gun. He got no response. Then\n",
      "the long-pent-up rage burst. With wild whoops he pulled another gun and\n",
      "shot at the mirror, the lamps. He shot the neck off a bottle and drank\n",
      "till he choked, his neck corded, bulging, and purple. His only slow and\n",
      "deliberate action was the reloading of his gun. Then he crashed through\n",
      "the doors, and with a wild yell leaped sheer into the saddle, hauling\n",
      "his horse up high and goading him to plunge away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men running to the door and windows of the store saw a streak of dust\n",
      "flying down the road. And then they trooped out to see it disappear. The\n",
      "hour of suspense ended for them. Las Vegas had lived up to the code of\n",
      "the West, had dared his man out, had waited far longer than needful to\n",
      "prove that man a coward. Whatever the issue now, Beasley was branded\n",
      "forever. That moment saw the decline of whatever power he had wielded.\n",
      "He and his men might kill the cowboy who had ridden out alone to face\n",
      "him, but that would not change the brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preceding night Beasley bad been finishing a late supper at his\n",
      "newly acquired ranch, when Buck Weaver, one of his men, burst in upon\n",
      "him with news of the death of Mulvey and Pedro.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's in the outfit? How many?” he had questioned, quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a one-man outfit, boss,” replied Weaver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley appeared astounded. He and his men had prepared to meet the\n",
      "friends of the girl whose property he had taken over, and because of the\n",
      "superiority of his own force he had anticipated no bloody or extended\n",
      "feud. This amazing circumstance put the case in very much more difficult\n",
      "form.\n",
      "\n",

      "This rider had once worked for Al Auchincloss and had deserted to\n",

      "Beasley gave Weaver a dark, lowering glance, and waved him away. From\n",

      "But Beasley did not go. Instead he paced to and fro the length of Helen\n",
      "Rayner's long sitting-room with the nervous energy of a man who\n",
      "could not rest. Many times he hesitated, and at others he made sudden\n",
      "movements toward the door, only to halt. Long after midnight he went\n",
      "to bed, but not to sleep. He tossed and rolled all night, and at dawn\n",
      "arose, gloomy and irritable.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cursed the Mexican serving-women who showed their displeasure at\n",
      "his authority. And to his amaze and rage not one of his men came to\n",
      "the house. He waited and waited. Then he stalked off to the corrals and\n",
      "stables carrying a rifle with him. The men were there, in a group that\n",
      "dispersed somewhat at his advent. Not a Mexican was in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley ordered the horses to be saddled and all hands to go down into\n",
      "the village with him. That order was disobeyed. Beasley stormed and\n",
      "raged. His riders sat or lounged, with lowered faces. An unspoken\n",
      "hostility seemed present. Those who had been longest with him were least\n",
      "distant and strange, but still they did not obey. At length Beasley\n",
      "roared for his Mexicans.\n",

      "Of all these sudden-uprising perplexities this latest was the most\n",
      "astounding. Beasley cursed with his questioning wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, they was sure scared of thet gun-slingin' cowboy from Texas,”\n",
      " replied Weaver, imperturbably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley's dark, swarthy face changed its hue. What of the subtle\n",
      "reflection in Weaver's slow speech! One of the men came out of a corral\n",
      "leading Beasley's saddled and bridled horse. This fellow dropped the\n",
      "bridle and sat down among his comrades without a word. No one spoke. The\n",
      "presence of the horse was significant. With a snarling, muttered curse,\n",
      "Beasley took up his rifle and strode back to the ranch-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his rage and passion he did not realize what his men had known for\n",
      "hours--that if he had stood any chance at all for their respect as well\n",
      "as for his life the hour was long past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley avoided the open paths to the house, and when he got there he\n",
      "nervously poured out a drink. Evidently something in the fiery liquor\n",
      "frightened him, for he threw the bottle aside. It was as if that bottle\n",
      "contained a courage which was false.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he paced the long sitting-room, growing more and more wrought-up\n",
      "as evidently he grew familiar with the singular state of affairs. Twice\n",
      "the pale serving-woman called him to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dining-room was light and pleasant, and the meal, fragrant and\n",
      "steaming, was ready for him. But the women had disappeared. Beasley\n",
      "seated himself--spread out his big hands on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a slight rustle--a clink of spur--startled him. He twisted his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Beasley!” said Las Vegas, who had appeared as if by magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley's frame seemed to swell as if a flood had been loosed in his\n",
      "veins. Sweat-drops stood out on his pallid face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What--you--want?” he asked, huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal now, my boss, Miss Helen, says, seein' I am foreman heah, thet it'd\n",
      "be nice an' proper fer me to drop in an' eat with you--THE LAST TIME!”\n",
      " replied the cowboy. His drawl was slow and cool, his tone was friendly\n",

      "Beasley's reply was loud, incoherent, hoarse.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Eat or not, it's shore all the same to me,” said Las Vegas, and he\n",
      "began to load his plate with his left hand. His right hand rested very\n",
      "lightly, with just the tips of his vibrating fingers on the edge of\n",
      "the table; and he never for the slightest fraction of a second took his\n",

      " began Las Vegas, softly. And then he helped himself leisurely to food\n",
      "and drink. “In my day I've shore stacked up against a lot of outlaws,\n",
      "thieves, rustlers, an' sich like, but fer an out an' out dirty low-down\n",

      "worst!... I was thinkin' last night mebbe you'd come down an' meet me\n",
      "like a man, so 's I could wash my hands ever afterward without gettin'\n",
      "sick to my stummick. But you didn't come.... Beasley, I'm so ashamed of\n",

      "Gawd!--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael, gimme a word in,” hoarsely broke out Beasley. “You're\n",
      "right, it won't do no good to call me.... But let's talk.... I'll buy\n",
      "you off. Ten thousand dollars--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! Haw!” roared Las Vegas. He was as tense as a strung cord and\n",
      "his face possessed a singular pale radiance. His right hand began to\n",
      "quiver more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll--double--it!” panted Beasley. “I'll--make over--half the\n",
      "ranch--all the stock--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swaller thet!” yelled Las Vegas, with terrible strident ferocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen--man!... I take--it back!... I'll give up--Auchincloss's ranch!”\n",
      " Beasley was now a shaking, whispering, frenzied man, ghastly white, with\n",
      "rolling eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas's left fist pounded hard on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“GREASER, COME ON!” he thundered.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXVI\n",
      "\n",
      "For Helen Rayner that brief, dark period of expulsion from her home had\n",
      "become a thing of the past, almost forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two months had flown by on the wings of love and work and the joy of\n",
      "finding her place there in the West. All her old men had been only too\n",
      "glad of the opportunity to come back to her, and under Dale and Roy\n",
      "Beeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of\n",
      "rooms and adding a new section. Only once had she ventured into the old\n",
      "dining-room where Las Vegas Carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner\n",
      "for Beasley. She made a store-room of it, and a place she would never\n",
      "again enter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was happy, almost too happy, she thought, and therefore made\n",
      "more than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of\n",
      "life. Carmichael had ridden out of Pine, ostensibly on the trail of the\n",
      "Mexicans who had executed Beasley's commands. The last seen of him\n",
      "had been reported from Show Down, where he had appeared red-eyed and\n",
      "dangerous, like a hound on a scent. Then two months had flown by without\n",
      "a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboy's\n",
      "absence. It would be just like Las Vegas never to be heard of again.\n",
      "Also it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his\n",
      "drunken, savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by\n",
      "his friends. Bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than\n",
      "Helen. But Bo grew more restless, wilder, and more wilful than ever.\n",
      "Helen thought she guessed Bo's secret; and once she ventured a hint\n",
      "concerning Carmichael's return.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Tom doesn't come back pretty soon I'll marry Milt Dale,” retorted\n",
      "Bo, tauntingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This fired Helen's cheeks with red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, child,” she protested, half angry, half grave. “Milt and I are\n",
      "engaged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. Only you're so slow. There's many a slip--you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I tell you Tom will come back,” replied Helen, earnestly. “I feel\n",
      "it. There was something fine in that cowboy. He understood me better\n",
      "than you or Milt, either.... And he was perfectly wild in love with\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! WAS he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much more than you deserved, Bo Rayner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then occurred one of Bo's sweet, bewildering, unexpected\n",
      "transformations. Her defiance, resentment, rebelliousness, vanished from\n",
      "a softly agitated face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell, I know that.... You just watch me if I ever get another\n",
      "chance at him!... Then--maybe he'd never drink again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, be happy--and be good. Don't ride off any more--don't tease the\n",
      "boys. It'll all come right in the end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo recovered her equanimity quickly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! You can afford to be cheerful. You've got a man who can't live\n",
      "when you're out of his sight. He's like a fish on dry land.... And\n",
      "you--why, once you were an old pessimist!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was not to be consoled or changed. Helen could only sigh and pray\n",
      "that her convictions would be verified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first day of July brought an early thunder-storm, just at sunrise.\n",
      "It roared and flared and rolled away, leaving a gorgeous golden cloud\n",
      "pageant in the sky and a fresh, sweetly smelling, glistening green range\n",
      "that delighted Helen's eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Birds were twittering in the arbors and bees were humming in the\n",
      "flowers. From the fields down along the brook came a blended song of\n",
      "swamp-blackbird and meadow-lark. A clarion-voiced burro split the air\n",
      "with his coarse and homely bray. The sheep were bleating, and a soft baa\n",
      "of little lambs came sweetly to Helen's ears. She went her usual rounds\n",
      "with more than usual zest and thrill. Everywhere was color, activity,\n",
      "life. The wind swept warm and pine-scented down from the mountain\n",
      "heights, now black and bold, and the great green slopes seemed to call\n",
      "to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment she came suddenly upon Dale, in his shirt-sleeves,\n",
      "dusty and hot, standing motionless, gazing at the distant mountains.\n",
      "Helen's greeting startled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I was just looking away yonder,” he said, smiling. She thrilled at\n",
      "the clear, wonderful light of his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So was I--a moment ago,” she replied, wistfully. “Do you miss the\n",
      "forest--very much?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I miss nothing. But I'd like to ride with you under the pines\n",
      "once more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll go,” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When?” he asked, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--soon!” And then with flushed face and downcast eyes she passed on.\n",
      "For long Helen had cherished a fond hope that she might be married in\n",
      "Paradise Park, where she had fallen in love with Dale and had realized\n",
      "herself. But she had kept that hope secret. Dale's eager tone, his\n",
      "flashing eyes, had made her feel that her secret was there in her\n",
      "telltale face.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she entered the lane leading to the house she encountered one of the\n",
      "new stable-boys driving a pack-mule.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, whose pack is that?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ma'am, I dunno, but I heard him tell Roy he reckoned his name was mud,”\n",
      " replied the boy, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's heart gave a quick throb. That sounded like Las Vegas. She\n",
      "hurried on, and upon entering the courtyard she espied Roy Beeman\n",
      "holding the halter of a beautiful, wild-looking mustang. There was\n",
      "another horse with another man, who was in the act of dismounting on the\n",
      "far side. When he stepped into better view Helen recognized Las Vegas.\n",
      "And he saw her at the same instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen did not look up again until she was near the porch. She had\n",
      "dreaded this meeting, yet she was so glad that she could have cried\n",
      "aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, I shore am glad to see you,” he said, standing bareheaded\n",
      "before her, the same young, frank-faced cowboy she had seen first from\n",
      "the train.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom!” she exclaimed, and offered her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrung them hard while he looked at her. The swift woman's glance\n",
      "Helen gave in return seemed to drive something dark and doubtful out of\n",
      "her heart. This was the same boy she had known--whom she had liked so\n",
      "well--who had won her sister's love. Helen imagined facing him thus was\n",
      "like awakening from a vague nightmare of doubt. Carmichael's face was\n",
      "clean, fresh, young, with its healthy tan; it wore the old glad smile,\n",
      "cool, easy, and natural; his eyes were like Dale's--penetrating, clear\n",
      "as crystal, without a shadow. What had evil, drink, blood, to do\n",
      "with the real inherent nobility of this splendid specimen of Western\n",
      "hardihood? Wherever he had been, whatever he had done during that\n",
      "long absence, he had returned long separated from that wild and savage\n",
      "character she could now forget. Perhaps there would never again be call\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How's my girl?” he asked, just as naturally as if he had been gone a\n",
      "few days on some errand of his employer's.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo? Oh, she's well--fine. I--I rather think she'll be glad to see you,”\n",
      " replied Helen, warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' how's thet big Indian, Dale?” he drawled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, too--I'm sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I got back heah in time to see you-all married?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I assure you I--no one around here has been married yet,” replied\n",
      "Helen, with a blush.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet shore is fine. Was some worried,” he said, lazily. “I've been\n",
      "chasin' wild hosses over in New Mexico, an' I got after this heah blue\n",
      "roan. He kept me chasin' him fer a spell. I've fetched him back for Bo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen looked at the mustang Roy was holding, to be instantly delighted.\n",
      "He was a roan almost blue in color, neither large nor heavy, but\n",
      "powerfully built, clean-limbed, and racy, with a long mane and tail,\n",
      "black as coal, and a beautiful head that made Helen love him at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'm jealous,” declared Helen, archly. “I never did see such a\n",
      "pony.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckoned you'd never ride any hoss but Ranger,” said Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I never will. But I can be jealous, anyhow, can't I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. An I reckon if you say you're goin' to have him--wal, Bo 'd be\n",
      "funny,” he drawled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon she would be funny,” retorted Helen. She was so happy that\n",
      "she imitated his speech. She wanted to hug him. It was too good to be\n",
      "true--the return of this cowboy. He understood her. He had come back\n",
      "with nothing that could alienate her. He had apparently forgotten the\n",
      "terrible role he had accepted and the doom he had meted out to her\n",
      "enemies. That moment was wonderful for Helen in its revelation of the\n",
      "strange significance of the West as embodied in this cowboy. He was\n",
      "great. But he did not know that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the door of the living-room opened, and a sweet, high voice pealed\n",
      "out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy! Oh, what a mustang! Whose is he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Bo, if all I hear is so he belongs to you,” replied Roy with a\n",
      "huge grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo appeared in the door. She stepped out upon the porch. She saw the\n",
      "cowboy. The excited flash of her pretty face vanished as she paled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I shore am glad to see you,” drawled Las Vegas, as he stepped\n",
      "forward, sombrero in hand. Helen could not see any sign of confusion in\n",
      "him. But, indeed, she saw gladness. Then she expected to behold Bo run\n",
      "right into the cowboys's arms. It appeared, however, that she was doomed\n",
      "to disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, I'm glad to see you,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "They shook hands as old friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're lookin' right fine,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I'm well.... And how have you been these six months?” she queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I though it was longer,” he drawled. “Wal, I'm pretty tip-top\n",
      "now, but I was laid up with heart trouble for a spell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heart trouble?” she echoed, dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore.... I ate too much over heah in New Mexico.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's no news to me--where your heart's located,” laughed Bo. Then she\n",
      "ran off the porch to see the blue mustang. She walked round and round\n",
      "him, clasping her hands in sheer delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, he's a plumb dandy,” said Roy. “Never seen a prettier hoss. He'll\n",
      "run like a streak. An' he's got good eyes. He'll be a pet some day. But\n",
      "I reckon he'll always be spunky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo ventured to step closer, and at last got a hand on the mustang, and\n",
      "then another. She smoothed his quivering neck and called softly to him,\n",
      "until he submitted to her hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's his name?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blue somethin' or other,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, has my new mustang a name?” asked Bo, turning to the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I named him Blue-Bo,” answered Las Vegas, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blue-Boy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nope. He's named after you. An' I chased him, roped him, broke him all\n",
      "myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well. Blue-Bo he is, then.... And he's a wonderful darling horse.\n",
      "Oh, Nell, just look at him.... Tom, I can't thank you enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I don't want any thanks,” drawled the cowboy. “But see heah, Bo,\n",
      "you shore got to live up to conditions before you ride him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” exclaimed Bo, who was startled by his slow, cool, meaning tone,\n",
      "of voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen delighted in looking at Las Vegas then. He had never appeared to\n",
      "better advantage. So cool, careless, and assured! He seemed master of\n",
      "a situation in which his terms must be accepted. Yet he might have been\n",
      "actuated by a cowboy motive beyond the power of Helen to divine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo Rayner,” drawled Las Vegas, “thet blue mustang will be yours, an'\n",
      "you can ride him--when you're MRS. TOM CARMICHAEL!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had he spoken a softer, more drawling speech, nor gazed at Bo\n",
      "more mildly. Roy seemed thunderstruck. Helen endeavored heroically to\n",
      "restrain her delicious, bursting glee. Bo's wide eyes stared at her\n",
      "lover--darkened--dilated. Suddenly she left the mustang to confront the\n",
      "cowboy where he lounged on the porch steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that?” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah! It's only a magnificent bluff,” she retorted. “You're only in fun.\n",
      "It's your--your darned nerve!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Bo,” began Las Vegas, reproachfully. “You shore know I'm not the\n",
      "four-flusher kind. Never got away with a bluff in my life! An' I'm jest\n",
      "in daid earnest aboot this heah.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All the same, signs were not wanting in his mobile face that he was\n",
      "almost unable to restrain his mirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen realized then that Bo saw through the cowboy--that the ultimatum\n",
      "was only one of his tricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It IS a bluff and I CALL you!” declared Bo, ringingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas suddenly awoke to consequences. He essayed to speak, but she\n",
      "was so wonderful then, so white and blazing-eyed, that he was stricken\n",
      "mute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll ride Blue-Bo this afternoon,” deliberately stated the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas had wit enough to grasp her meaning, and he seemed about to\n",
      "collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well, you can make me Mrs. Tom Carmichael to-day--this\n",
      "morning--just before dinner.... Go get a preacher to marry us--and\n",
      "make yourself look a more presentable bridegroom--UNLESS IT WAS ONLY A\n",
      "BLUFF!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her imperiousness changed as the tremendous portent of her words seemed\n",
      "to make Las Vegas a blank, stone image of a man. With a wild-rose color\n",
      "suffusing her face, she swiftly bent over him, kissed him, and flashed\n",
      "away into the house. Her laugh pealed back, and it thrilled Helen, so\n",
      "deep and strange was it for the wilful sister, so wild and merry and\n",
      "full of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that Roy Beeman recovered from his paralysis, to let out\n",
      "such a roar of mirth as to frighten the horses. Helen was laughing, and\n",
      "crying, too, but laughing mostly. Las Vegas Carmichael was a sight for\n",
      "the gods to behold. Bo's kiss had unclamped what had bound him. The\n",
      "sudden truth, undeniable, insupportable, glorious, made him a madman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bluff--she called me--ride Blue-Bo saf'ternoon!” he raved,\n",
      "reaching wildly for Helen. “Mrs.--Tom--Carmichael--before\n",
      "dinner--preacher--presentable bridegroom!... Aw! I'm drunk again! I--who\n",
      "swore off forever!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Tom, you're just happy,” said Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between her and Roy the cowboy was at length persuaded to accept the\n",
      "situation and to see his wonderful opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now--now, Miss Helen--what'd Bo mean by pre--presentable bridegroom?...\n",
      "Presents? Lord, I'm clean busted flat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She meant you must dress up in your best, of course,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where 'n earth will I get a preacher?... Show Down's forty miles....\n",
      "Can't ride there in time.... Roy, I've gotta have a preacher.... Life or\n",
      "death deal fer me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, old man, if you'll brace up I'll marry you to Bo,” said Roy, with\n",
      "his glad grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” gasped Las Vegas, as if at the coming of a sudden beautiful hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, I'm a preacher,” replied Roy, now earnestly. “You didn't know\n",
      "thet, but I am. An' I can marry you an' Bo as good as any one, an'\n",
      "tighter 'n most.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas reached for his friend as a drowning man might have reached\n",
      "for solid rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, can you really marry them--with my Bible--and the service of my\n",
      "church?” asked Helen, a happy hope flushing her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, indeed I can. I've married more 'n one couple whose religion\n",
      "wasn't mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“B-b-before--d-d-din-ner!” burst out Las Vegas, like a stuttering idiot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon. Come on, now, an' make yourself pre-senttible,” said Roy.\n",
      "“Miss Helen, you tell Bo thet it's all settled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up the halter on the blue mustang and turned away toward the\n",
      "corrals. Las Vegas put the bridle of his horse over his arm, and seemed\n",
      "to be following in a trance, with his dazed, rapt face held high.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bring Dale,” called Helen, softly after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So it came about as naturally as it was wonderful that Bo rode the blue\n",
      "mustang before the afternoon ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas disobeyed his first orders from Mrs. Tom Carmichael and rode\n",
      "out after her toward the green-rising range. Helen seemed impelled to\n",
      "follow. She did not need to ask Dale the second time. They rode swiftly,\n",
      "but never caught up with Bo and Las Vegas, whose riding resembled their\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale read Helen's mind, or else his own thoughts were in harmony with\n",
      "hers, for he always seemed to speak what she was thinking. And as they\n",
      "rode homeward he asked her in his quiet way if they could not spare a\n",
      "few days to visit his old camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And take Bo--and Tom? Oh, of all things I'd like to'” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--an' Roy, too,” added Dale, significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” said Helen, lightly, as if she had not caught his meaning.\n",
      "But she turned her eyes away, while her heart thumped disgracefully and\n",
      "all her body was aglow. “Will Tom and Bo go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was Tom who got me to ask you,” replied Dale. “John an' Hal can look\n",
      "after the men while we're gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--so Tom put it in your head? I guess--maybe--I won't go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is always in my mind, Nell,” he said, with his slow seriousness.\n",
      "“I'm goin' to work all my life for you. But I'll want to an' need to go\n",
      "back to the woods often.... An' if you ever stoop to marry me--an' make\n",
      "me the richest of men--you'll have to marry me up there where I fell in\n",
      "love with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Did Las Vegas Tom Carmichael say that, too?” inquired Helen,\n",
      "softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, do you want to know what Las Vegas said?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By all means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He said this--an' not an hour ago. 'Milt, old hoss, let me give you a\n",
      "hunch. I'm a man of family now--an' I've been a devil with the wimmen\n",
      "in my day. I can see through 'em. Don't marry Nell Rayner in or near the\n",
      "house where I killed Beasley. She'd remember. An' don't let her remember\n",
      "thet day. Go off into the woods. Paradise Park! Bo an' me will go with\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gave him her hand, while they walked the horses homeward in the\n",
      "long sunset shadows. In the fullness of that happy hour she had time for\n",
      "a grateful wonder at the keen penetration of the cowboy Carmichael. Dale\n",
      "had saved her life, but it was Las Vegas who had saved her happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not many days later, when again the afternoon shadows were slanting low,\n",
      "Helen rode out upon the promontory where the dim trail zigzagged far\n",
      "above Paradise Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy was singing as he drove the pack-burros down the slope; Bo and Las\n",
      "Vegas were trying to ride the trail two abreast, so they could hold\n",
      "hands; Dale had dismounted to stand beside Helen's horse, as she gazed\n",
      "down the shaggy black slopes to the beautiful wild park with its gray\n",
      "meadows and shining ribbons of brooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was July, and there were no golden-red glorious flames and blazes of\n",
      "color such as lingered in Helen's memory. Black spruce slopes and green\n",
      "pines and white streaks of aspens and lacy waterfall of foam and dark\n",
      "outcroppings of rock--these colors and forms greeted her gaze with all\n",
      "the old enchantment. Wildness, beauty, and loneliness were there, the\n",
      "same as ever, immutable, like the spirit of those heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen would fain have lingered longer, but the others called, and Ranger\n",
      "impatiently snorted his sense of the grass and water far below. And she\n",
      "knew that when she climbed there again to the wide outlook she would be\n",
      "another woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, come on,” said Dale, as he led on. “It's better to look up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had just sunk behind the ragged fringe of mountain-rim when\n",
      "those three strong and efficient men of the open had pitched camp and\n",
      "had prepared a bountiful supper. Then Roy Beeman took out the little\n",
      "worn Bible which Helen had given him to use when he married Bo, and as\n",
      "he opened it a light changed his dark face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Helen an' Dale,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arose to stand before him. And he married them there under the\n",
      "great, stately pines, with the fragrant blue smoke curling upward, and\n",
      "the wind singing through the branches, while the waterfall murmured its\n",
      "low, soft, dreamy music, and from the dark slope came the wild, lonely\n",
      "cry of a wolf, full of the hunger for life and a mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us pray,” said Roy, as he closed the Bible, and knelt with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is only one God, an' Him I beseech in my humble office for the\n",
      "woman an' man I have just wedded in holy bonds. Bless them an' watch\n",
      "them an' keep them through all the comin' years. Bless the sons of\n",
      "this strong man of the woods an' make them like him, with love an'\n",
      "understandin' of the source from which life comes. Bless the daughters\n",
      "of this woman an' send with them more of her love an' soul, which must\n",
      "be the softenin' an' the salvation of the hard West. O Lord, blaze the\n",
      "dim, dark trail for them through the unknown forest of life! O Lord,\n",
      "lead the way across the naked range of the future no mortal knows! We\n",
      "ask in Thy name! Amen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the preacher stood up again and raised the couple from their\n",
      "kneeling posture, it seemed that a grave and solemn personage had left\n",
      "him. This young man was again the dark-faced, clear-eyed Roy, droll and\n",
      "dry, with the enigmatic smile on his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Dale,” he said, taking her hands, “I wish you joy.... An' now,\n",
      "after this here, my crownin' service in your behalf--I reckon I'll claim\n",
      "a reward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he kissed her. Bo came next with her warm and loving felicitations,\n",
      "and the cowboy, with characteristic action, also made at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, shore it's the only chance I'll ever have to kiss you,” he\n",
      "drawled. “Because when this heah big Indian once finds out what kissin'\n",
      "is--!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas then proved how swift and hearty he could be upon occasions.\n",
      "All this left Helen red and confused and unutterably happy. She\n",
      "appreciated Dale's state. His eyes reflected the precious treasure\n",
      "which manifestly he saw, but realization of ownership had not yet become\n",
      "demonstrable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with gay speech and happy laugh and silent look these five partook\n",
      "of the supper. When it was finished Roy made known his intention to\n",
      "leave. They all protested and coaxed, but to no avail. He only laughed\n",
      "and went on saddling his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, please stay,” implored Helen. “The day's almost ended. You're\n",
      "tired.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nope. I'll never be no third party when there's only two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there are four of us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn't I just make you an' Dale one?... An', Mrs. Dale, you forget I've\n",
      "been married more 'n once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen found herself confronted by an unanswerable side of the argument.\n",
      "Las Vegas rolled on the grass in his mirth. Dale looked strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, then that's why you're so nice,” said Bo, with a little devil in\n",
      "her eyes. “Do you know I had my mind made up if Tom hadn't come around I\n",
      "was going to make up to you, Roy.... I sure was. What number wife would\n",
      "I have been?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It always took Bo to turn the tables on anybody. Roy looked mightily\n",
      "embarrassed. And the laugh was on him. He did not face them again until\n",
      "he had mounted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I've done my best for you--hitched you to thet blue-eyed\n",
      "girl the best I know how,” he declared. “But I shore ain't guaranteein'\n",
      "nothin'. You'd better build a corral for her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Roy, you shore don't savvy the way to break these wild ones,”\n",
      " drawled Las Vegas. “Bo will be eatin' out of my hand in about a week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's blue eyes expressed an eloquent doubt as to this extraordinary\n",
      "claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-by, friends,” said Roy, and rode away to disappear in the spruces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon Bo and Las Vegas forgot Roy, and Dale and Helen, the camp\n",
      "chores to be done, and everything else except themselves. Helen's first\n",
      "wifely duty was to insist that she should and could and would help her\n",
      "husband with the work of cleaning up after the sumptuous supper. Before\n",
      "they had finished a sound startled them. It came from Roy, evidently\n",
      "high on the darkening slope, and was a long, mellow pealing halloo, that\n",
      "rang on the cool air, burst the dreamy silence, and rapped across\n",
      "from slope to slope and cliff to cliff, to lose its power and die away\n",
      "hauntingly in the distant recesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook his head as if he did not care to attempt a reply to that\n",
      "beautiful call. Silence once again enfolded the park, and twilight\n",
      "seemed to be born of the air, drifting downward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, do you miss anythin'?” asked Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Nothing in all the world,” she murmured. “I am happier than I ever\n",
      "dared pray to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't mean people or things. I mean my pets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! I had forgotten.... Milt, where are they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone back to the wild,” he said. “They had to live in my absence. An'\n",
      "I've been away long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the brooding silence, with its soft murmur of falling water\n",
      "and faint sigh of wind in the pines, was broken by a piercing scream,\n",
      "high, quivering, like that of a woman in exquisite agony.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's Tom!” exclaimed Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--I was so--so frightened!” whispered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo came running, with Las Vegas at her heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, that was your tame cougar,” cried Bo, excitedly. “Oh, I'll never\n",
      "forget him! I'll hear those cries in my dreams!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it was Tom,” said Dale, thoughtfully. “But I never heard him cry\n",
      "just like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, call him in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale whistled and called, but Tom did not come. Then the hunter stalked\n",
      "off in the gloom to call from different points under the slope. After\n",
      "a while he returned without the cougar. And at that moment, from far\n",
      "up the dark ravine, drifted down the same wild cry, only changed by\n",
      "distance, strange and tragic in its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He scented us. He remembers. But he'll never come back,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt stirred anew with the convictions of Dale's deep knowledge of\n",
      "life and nature. And her imagination seemed to have wings. How full and\n",
      "perfect her trust, her happiness in the realization that her love and\n",
      "her future, her children, and perhaps grandchildren, would come under\n",
      "the guidance of such a man! Only a little had she begun to comprehend\n",
      "the secrets of good and ill in their relation to the laws of nature.\n",
      "Ages before men had lived on the earth there had been the creatures of\n",
      "the wilderness, and the holes of the rocks, and the nests of the trees,\n",
      "and rain, frost, heat, dew, sunlight and night, storm and calm, the\n",
      "honey of the wildflower and the instinct of the bee--all the beautiful\n",
      "and multiple forms of life with their inscrutable design. To know\n",
      "something of them and to love them was to be close to the kingdom of\n",
      "earth--perhaps to the greater kingdom of heaven. For whatever breathed\n",
      "and moved was a part of that creation. The coo of the dove, the lichen\n",
      "on the mossy rock, the mourn of a hunting wolf, and the murmur of the\n",
      "waterfall, the ever-green and growing tips of the spruces, and the\n",
      "thunderbolts along the battlements of the heights--these one and all\n",
      "must be actuated by the great spirit--that incalculable thing in the\n",
      "universe which had produced man and soul.\n",

      "\n",
      "At sunset hour the forest was still, lonely, sweet with tang of fir and\n",
      "spruce, blazing in gold and red and green; and the man who glided on\n",
      "under the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and, disappearing,\n",
      "to have become a part of the wild woodland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Baldy, highest of the White Mountains, stood up round and bare,\n",
      "rimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun. Then, as the\n",
      "fire dropped behind the domed peak, a change, a cold and darkening\n",
      "blight, passed down the black spear-pointed slopes over all that\n",
      "mountain world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a wild, richly timbered, and abundantly watered region of dark\n",
      "forests and grassy parks, ten thousand feet above sea-level, isolated\n",
      "on all sides by the southern Arizona desert--the virgin home of elk and\n",
      "deer, of bear and lion, of wolf and fox, and the birthplace as well as\n",
      "the hiding-place of the fierce Apache.\n",
      "\n",
      "September in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze\n",
      "following shortly after sundown. Twilight appeared to come on its wings,\n",
      "as did faint sounds, not distinguishable before in the stillness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milt Dale, man of the forest, halted at the edge of a timbered ridge, to\n",
      "listen and to watch. Beneath him lay a narrow valley, open and grassy,\n",
      "from which rose a faint murmur of running water. Its music was pierced\n",
      "by the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote. From overhead in the\n",
      "giant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the\n",
      "night; and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild\n",
      "turkeys going to roost.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Dale's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been,\n",
      "betokening an unchanged serenity of forestland. He was glad, for he had\n",
      "expected to hear the clipclop of white men's horses--which to hear up\n",
      "in those fastnesses was hateful to him. He and the Indian were friends.\n",
      "That fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter. But there hid\n",
      "somewhere in the forest a gang of bad men, sheep-thieves, whom Dale did\n",
      "not want to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he started out upon the slope, a sudden flaring of the afterglow of\n",
      "sunset flooded down from Old Baldy, filling the valley with lights and\n",
      "shadows, yellow and blue, like the radiance of the sky. The pools in the\n",
      "curves of the brook shone darkly bright. Dale's gaze swept up and down\n",
      "the valley, and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook\n",
      "where the wall of spruce stood up, its speared and spiked crest against\n",
      "the pale clouds. The wind began to moan in the trees and there was a\n",
      "feeling of rain in the air. Dale, striking a trail, turned his back to\n",
      "the fading afterglow and strode down the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "With night at hand and a rain-storm brewing, he did not head for his\n",
      "own camp, some miles distant, but directed his steps toward an old log\n",
      "cabin. When he reached it darkness had almost set in. He approached with\n",
      "caution. This cabin, like the few others scattered in the valleys, might\n",
      "harbor Indians or a bear or a panther. Nothing, however, appeared to be\n",
      "there. Then Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky, and he felt\n",
      "the cool dampness of a fine, misty rain on his face. It would rain off\n",
      "and on during the night. Whereupon he entered the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the next moment he heard quick hoof-beats of trotting horses.\n",
      "Peering out, he saw dim, moving forms in the darkness, quite close\n",
      "at hand. They had approached against the wind so that sound had been\n",
      "deadened. Five horses with riders, Dale made out--saw them loom close.\n",
      "Then he heard rough voices. Quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a\n",
      "ladder he knew led to a loft; and finding it, he quickly mounted, taking\n",
      "care not to make a noise with his rifle, and lay down upon the floor\n",
      "of brush and poles. Scarcely had he done so when heavy steps, with\n",
      "accompaniment of clinking spurs, passed through the door below into the\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Beasley, are you here?” queried a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no reply. The man below growled under his breath, and again\n",
      "the spurs jingled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fellars, Beasley ain't here yet,” he called. “Put the hosses under the\n",
      "shed. We'll wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait, huh!” came a harsh reply. “Mebbe all night--an' we got nuthin' to\n",
      "eat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up, Moze. Reckon you're no good for anythin' but eatin'. Put them\n",
      "hosses away an' some of you rustle fire-wood in here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Low, muttered curses, then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain\n",
      "of leather and heaves of tired horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another shuffling, clinking footstep entered the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, it'd been sense to fetch a pack along,” drawled this newcomer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon so, Jim. But we didn't, an' what's the use hollerin'? Beasley\n",
      "won't keep us waitin' long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, lying still and prone, felt a slow start in all his blood--a\n",
      "thrilling wave. That deep-voiced man below was Snake Anson, the worst\n",
      "and most dangerous character of the region; and the others, undoubtedly,\n",
      "composed his gang, long notorious in that sparsely settled country.\n",
      "And the Beasley mentioned--he was one of the two biggest ranchers and\n",
      "sheep-raisers of the White Mountain ranges. What was the meaning of\n",
      "a rendezvous between Snake Anson and Beasley? Milt Dale answered that\n",
      "question to Beasley's discredit; and many strange matters pertaining to\n",
      "sheep and herders, always a mystery to the little village of Pine, now\n",
      "became as clear as daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other men entered the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't a-goin' to rain much,” said one. Then came a crash of wood\n",
      "thrown to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, hyar's a chunk of pine log, dry as punk,” said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rustlings and slow footsteps, and then heavy thuds attested to the\n",
      "probability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to\n",
      "split off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, lemme your pipe, an' I'll hev a fire in a jiffy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I want my terbacco an' I ain't carin' about no fire,” replied\n",
      "Snake.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you're the meanest cuss in these woods,” drawled Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharp click of steel on flint--many times--and then a sound of hard\n",
      "blowing and sputtering told of Jim's efforts to start a fire. Presently\n",
      "the pitchy blackness of the cabin changed; there came a little crackling\n",
      "of wood and the rustle of flame, and then a steady growing roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it chanced, Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft, and right\n",
      "near his eyes there were cracks between the boughs. When the fire blazed\n",
      "up he was fairly well able to see the men below. The only one he had\n",
      "ever seen was Jim Wilson, who had been well known at Pine before Snake\n",
      "Anson had ever been heard of. Jim was the best of a bad lot, and he had\n",
      "friends among the honest people. It was rumored that he and Snake did\n",
      "not pull well together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fire feels good,” said the burly Moze, who appeared as broad as he was\n",
      "black-visaged. “Fall's sure a-comin'... Now if only we had some grub!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Moze, there's a hunk of deer meat in my saddle-bag, an' if you git it\n",
      "you can have half,” spoke up another voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze shuffled out with alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the firelight Snake Anson's face looked lean and serpent-like, his\n",
      "eyes glittered, and his long neck and all of his long length carried out\n",
      "the analogy of his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, what's this here deal with Beasley?” inquired Jim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you'll l'arn when I do,” replied the leader. He appeared tired\n",
      "and thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herders--for\n",
      "nothin'?” queried the youngest of the gang, a boy in years, whose hard,\n",
      "bitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're dead right, Burt--an' that's my stand,” replied the man who\n",
      "had sent Moze out. “Snake, snow 'll be flyin' round these woods before\n",
      "long,” said Jim Wilson. “Are we goin' to winter down in the Tonto Basin\n",
      "or over on the Gila?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon we'll do some tall ridin' before we strike south,” replied\n",
      "Snake, gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the juncture Moze returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, I heerd a hoss comin' up the trail,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake rose and stood at the door, listening. Outside the wind moaned\n",
      "fitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” exclaimed Snake, in relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence ensued then for a moment, at the end of which interval Dale\n",
      "heard a rapid clip-clop on the rocky trail outside. The men below\n",
      "shuffled uneasily, but none of them spoke. The fire cracked cheerily.\n",
      "Snake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that\n",
      "expressed both doubt and caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trotting horse had halted out there somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ho there, inside!” called a voice from the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ho yourself!” replied Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That you, Snake?” quickly followed the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon so,” returned Anson, showing himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newcomer entered. He was a large man, wearing a slicker that shone\n",
      "wet in the firelight. His sombrero, pulled well down, shadowed his face,\n",
      "so that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked.\n",
      "He had a black, drooping mustache, and a chin like a rock. A potential\n",
      "force, matured and powerful, seemed to be wrapped in his movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo, Snake! Hullo, Wilson!” he said. “I've backed out on the other\n",
      "deal. Sent for you on--on another little matter... particular private.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here he indicated with a significant gesture that Snake's men were to\n",
      "leave the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! ejaculated Anson, dubiously. Then he turned abruptly. Moze,\n",
      "you an' Shady an' Burt go wait outside. Reckon this ain't the deal I\n",
      "expected.... An' you can saddle the hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three members of the gang filed out, all glancing keenly at the\n",
      "stranger, who had moved back into the shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right now, Beasley,” said Anson, low-voiced. “What's your game?\n",
      "Jim, here, is in on my deals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beasley came forward to the fire, stretching his hands to the\n",
      "blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothin' to do with sheep,” replied he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckoned not,” assented the other. “An' say--whatever your game\n",
      "is, I ain't likin' the way you kept me waitin' an' ridin' around. We\n",
      "waited near all day at Big Spring. Then thet greaser rode up an' sent us\n",
      "here. We're a long way from camp with no grub an' no blankets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't keep you long,” said Beasley. “But even if I did you'd not\n",
      "mind--when I tell you this deal concerns Al Auchincloss--the man who\n",
      "made an outlaw of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame. Wilson,\n",
      "likewise, bent forward eagerly. Beasley glanced at the door--then began\n",
      "to whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Auchincloss is on his last legs. He's goin' to croak. He's sent\n",
      "back to Missouri for a niece--a young girl--an' he means to leave his\n",
      "ranches an' sheep--all his stock to her. Seems he has no one else....\n",
      "Them ranches--an' all them sheep an' hosses! You know me an' Al were\n",
      "pardners in sheep-raisin' for years. He swore I cheated him an' he threw\n",
      "me out. An' all these years I've been swearin' he did me dirt--owed me\n",
      "sheep an' money. I've got as many friends in Pine--an' all the way down\n",
      "the trail--as Auchincloss has.... An' Snake, see here--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the\n",
      "blaze. Anson leaned forward, like a serpent ready to strike, and Jim\n",
      "Wilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here,” panted Beasley. “The girl's due to arrive at Magdalena on\n",
      "the sixteenth. That's a week from to-morrow. She'll take the stage to\n",
      "Snowdrop, where some of Auchincloss's men will meet her with a team.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” grunted Anson as Beasley halted again. “An' what of all thet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She mustn't never get as far as Snowdrop!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You want me to hold up the stage--an' get the girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal--an' what then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make off with her.... She disappears. That's your affair. ... I'll\n",
      "press my claims on Auchincloss--hound him--an' be ready when he croaks\n",
      "to take over his property. Then the girl can come back, for all I\n",
      "care.... You an' Wilson fix up the deal between you. If you have to let\n",
      "the gang in on it don't give them any hunch as to who an' what. This 'll\n",
      "make you a rich stake. An' providin', when it's paid, you strike for new\n",
      "territory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet might be wise,” muttered Snake Anson. “Beasley, the weak point in\n",
      "your game is the uncertainty of life. Old Al is tough. He may fool you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Auchincloss is a dyin' man,” declared Beasley, with such positiveness\n",
      "that it could not be doubted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, he sure wasn't plumb hearty when I last seen him.... Beasley, in\n",
      "case I play your game--how'm I to know that girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her name's Helen Rayner,” replied Beasley, eagerly. “She's twenty\n",
      "years old. All of them Auchinclosses was handsome an' they say she's the\n",
      "handsomest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!... Beasley, this 's sure a bigger deal--an' one I ain't\n",
      "fancyin'.... But I never doubted your word.... Come on--an' talk out.\n",
      "What's in it for me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't let any one in on this. You two can hold up the stage. Why, it\n",
      "was never held up.... But you want to mask.... How about ten thousand\n",
      "sheep--or what they bring at Phenix in gold?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson whistled low.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' leave for new territory?” repeated Snake Anson, under his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You've said it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I ain't fancyin' the girl end of this deal, but you can count on\n",
      "me.... September sixteenth at Magdalena--an' her name's Helen--an' she's\n",
      "handsome?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. My herders will begin drivin' south in about two weeks. Later, if\n",
      "the weather holds good, send me word by one of them an' I'll meet you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze, pulled on his gloves\n",
      "and pulled down his sombrero, and with an abrupt word of parting strode\n",
      "out into the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, what do you make of him?” queried Snake Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pard, he's got us beat two ways for Sunday,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!... Wal, let's get back to camp.” And he led the way out.\n",

      "Low voices drifted into the cabin, then came snorts of horses and\n",

      "He was thirty years old. As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his\n",

      "And on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one\n",
      "of all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That man Beasley!” he soliloquized. “Beasley--in cahoots with Snake\n",
      "Anson!... Well, he was right. Al Auchincloss is on his last legs. Poor\n",
      "old man! When I tell him he'll never believe ME, that's sure!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Discovery of the plot meant to Dale that he must hurry down to Pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A girl--Helen Rayner--twenty years old,” he mused. “Beasley wants her\n",
      "made off with.... That means--worse than killed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired\n",
      "by one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore. Bad men worked\n",
      "their evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer. He had shot wolves for\n",
      "that trick. With men, good or bad, he had not clashed. Old women and\n",
      "children appealed to him, but he had never had any interest in girls.\n",
      "The image, then, of this Helen Rayner came strangely to Dale; and he\n",
      "suddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent Beasley, not\n",
      "to befriend old Al Auchincloss, but for the sake of the girl. Probably\n",
      "she was already on her way West, alone, eager, hopeful of a future home.\n",
      "How little people guessed what awaited them at a journey's end! Many\n",
      "trails ended abruptly in the forest--and only trained woodsmen could\n",
      "read the tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strange how I cut across country to-day from Spruce Swamp,” reflected\n",
      "Dale. Circumstances, movements, usually were not strange to him. His\n",
      "methods and habits were seldom changed by chance. The matter, then, of\n",
      "his turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason, and\n",
      "of his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl, was\n",
      "indeed an adventure to provoke thought. It provoked more, for Dale grew\n",
      "conscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins. He who had\n",
      "little to do with the strife of men, and nothing to do with anger, felt\n",
      "his blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Al won't listen to me,” pondered Dale. “An' even if he did, he\n",
      "wouldn't believe me. Maybe nobody will.... All the same, Snake Anson\n",
      "won't get that girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position, and\n",
      "his pondering ceased. Taking his rifle, he descended from the loft and\n",
      "peered out of the door. The night had grown darker, windier, cooler;\n",
      "broken clouds were scudding across the sky; only a few stars showed;\n",
      "fine rain was blowing from the northwest; and the forest seemed full of\n",
      "a low, dull roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I'd better hang up here,” he said, and turned to the fire. The\n",
      "coals were red now. From the depths of his hunting-coat he procured a\n",
      "little bag of salt and some strips of dried meat. These strips he laid\n",
      "for a moment on the hot embers, until they began to sizzle and curl;\n",
      "then with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter\n",
      "grateful for little.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of\n",
      "the fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing, glowing, golden embers.\n",
      "Outside, the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased\n",
      "to a roar. Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him, drowsily\n",
      "lulling; and he heard the storm-wind in the trees, now like a waterfall,\n",
      "and anon like a retreating army, and again low and sad; and he saw\n",
      "pictures in the glowing embers, strange as dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he rose and, climbing to the loft, he stretched himself out,\n",
      "and soon fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gray dawn broke he was on his way, 'cross-country, to the\n",
      "village of Pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased. A\n",
      "suspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places. All was gray--the\n",
      "parks, the glades--and deeper, darker gray marked the aisles of the\n",
      "forest. Shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent\n",
      "with spectral forms. Then the east kindled, the gray lightened, the\n",
      "dreaming woodland awoke to the far-reaching rays of a bursting red sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was always the happiest moment of Dale's lonely days, as sunset\n",
      "was his saddest. He responded, and there was something in his blood that\n",
      "answered the whistle of a stag from a near-by ridge. His strides were\n",
      "long, noiseless, and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the\n",
      "dew-laden grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest\n",
      "climbing, but the “senacas”--those parklike meadows so named by Mexican\n",
      "sheep-herders--were as round and level as if they had been made by man\n",
      "in beautiful contrast to the dark-green, rough, and rugged ridges. Both\n",
      "open senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance\n",
      "of game. The cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the\n",
      "spruces, a round black lumbering object, a twittering in the brush,\n",
      "and stealthy steps, were all easy signs for Dale to read. Once, as he\n",
      "noiselessly emerged into a little glade, he espied a red fox stalking\n",
      "some quarry, which, as he advanced, proved to be a flock of partridges.\n",
      "They whirred up, brushing the branches, and the fox trotted away. In\n",
      "every senaca Dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the\n",
      "high grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had always been his custom, on his visits to Pine, to kill and\n",
      "pack fresh meat down to several old friends, who were glad to give him\n",
      "lodging. And, hurried though he was now, he did not intend to make an\n",
      "exception of this trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length he got down into the pine belt, where the great, gnarled,\n",
      "yellow trees soared aloft, stately, and aloof from one another, and the\n",
      "ground was a brown, odorous, springy mat of pine-needles, level as a\n",
      "floor. Squirrels watched him from all around, scurrying away at his\n",
      "near approach--tiny, brown, light-striped squirrels, and larger ones,\n",
      "russet-colored, and the splendid dark-grays with their white bushy tails\n",
      "and plumed ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "This belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide, gray, rolling, open land,\n",
      "almost like a prairie, with foot-hills lifting near and far, and the\n",
      "red-gold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun. Here Dale\n",
      "flushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their\n",
      "subdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build,\n",
      "showed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock. They began\n",
      "to run pell-mell out into the grass, until only their heads appeared\n",
      "bobbing along, and finally disappeared. Dale caught a glimpse of\n",
      "skulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys, and as\n",
      "they saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the\n",
      "hindmost. His bullet struck low, as he had meant it to, but too low, and\n",
      "the coyote got only a dusting of earth and pine-needles thrown up into\n",
      "his face. This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt\n",
      "into a tree, rolled over, gained his feet, and then the cover of the\n",
      "forest. Dale was amused at this. His hand was against all the predatory\n",
      "beasts of the forest, though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf\n",
      "and fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the\n",
      "gentle, beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed. But some he\n",
      "loved better than others, and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "He crossed the wide, grassy plain and struck another gradual descent\n",
      "where aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm, sun-lighted\n",
      "glades bordered along a sparkling brook. Here he heard a turkey gobble,\n",
      "and that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching,\n",
      "silent detour around a clump of aspens. In a sunny patch of grass\n",
      "a dozen or more big gobblers stood, all suspiciously facing in his\n",
      "direction, heads erect, with that wild aspect peculiar to their species.\n",
      "Old wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk. Dale\n",
      "shot two of them. The others began to run like ostriches, thudding over\n",
      "the ground, spreading their wings, and with that running start launched\n",
      "their heavy bodies into whirring flight. They flew low, at about the\n",
      "height of a man from the grass, and vanished in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way. Soon\n",
      "he came to a break in the forest level, from which he gazed down a\n",
      "league-long slope of pine and cedar, out upon the bare, glistening\n",
      "desert, stretching away, endlessly rolling out to the dim, dark horizon\n",
      "line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered\n",
      "forest. A road, running parallel with a dark-watered, swift-flowing\n",
      "stream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue\n",
      "smoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow\n",
      "in the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted\n",
      "with horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site\n",
      "appeared to be a natural clearing, for there was no evidence of cut\n",
      "timber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene,\n",
      "tranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and\n",
      "happy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden\n",
      "bordered with sunflowers. His call was answered by an old woman, gray\n",
      "and bent, but remarkably spry, who appeared at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, land's sakes, if it ain't Milt Dale!” she exclaimed, in welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon it's me, Mrs. Cass,” he replied. “An' I've brought you a\n",
      "turkey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, you're that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass.... What\n",
      "a gobbler! First one I've seen this fall. My man Tom used to fetch home\n",
      "gobblers like that.... An' mebbe he'll come home again sometime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband, Tom Cass, had gone into the forest years before and had\n",
      "never returned. But the old woman always looked for him and never gave\n",
      "up hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back,” replied Dale, as\n",
      "he had said to her many a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come right in. You air hungry, I know. Now, son, when last did you eat\n",
      "a fresh egg or a flapjack?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should remember,” he answered, laughing, as he followed her into a\n",
      "small, clean kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laws-a'-me! An' thet's months ago,” she replied, shaking her gray head.\n",
      "“Milt, you should give up that wild life--an' marry--an' have a home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You always tell me that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, an' I'll see you do it yet.... Now you set there, an' pretty soon\n",
      "I'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's the news, Auntie?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nary news in this dead place. Why, nobody's been to Snowdrop in two\n",
      "weeks!... Sary Jones died, poor old soul--she's better off--an' one of\n",
      "my cows run away. Milt, she's wild when she gits loose in the woods.\n",
      "An' you'll have to track her, 'cause nobody else can. An' John Dakker's\n",
      "heifer was killed by a lion, an' Lem Harden's fast hoss--you know his\n",
      "favorite--was stole by hoss-thieves. Lem is jest crazy. An' that reminds\n",
      "me, Milt, where's your big ranger, thet you'd never sell or lend?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My horses are up in the woods, Auntie; safe, I reckon, from\n",
      "horse-thieves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, that's a blessin'. We've had some stock stole this summer, Milt,\n",
      "an' no mistake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, while preparing a meal for Dale, the old woman went on recounting\n",
      "all that had happened in the little village since his last visit. Dale\n",
      "enjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy, and it was exceedingly good\n",
      "to sit at her table. In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been\n",
      "such butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple\n",
      "pie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of\n",
      "Dale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How's old Al Auchincloss?” presently inquired Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poorly--poorly,” sighed Mrs. Cass. “But he tramps an' rides around\n",
      "same as ever. Al's not long for this world.... An', Milt, that reminds\n",
      "me--there's the biggest news you ever heard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don't say so!” exclaimed Dale, to encourage the excited old woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece, Helen Rayner. She's to\n",
      "inherit all his property. We've heard much of her--a purty lass, they\n",
      "say.... Now, Milt Dale, here's your chance. Stay out of the woods an' go\n",
      "to work.... You can marry that girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No chance for me, Auntie,” replied Dale, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old woman snorted. “Much you know! Any girl would have you, Milt\n",
      "Dale, if you'd only throw a kerchief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me!... An' why, Auntie?” he queried, half amused, half thoughtful. When\n",
      "he got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the\n",
      "ideas of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why? I declare, Milt, you live so in the woods you're like a boy of\n",
      "ten--an' then sometimes as old as the hills.... There's no young man to\n",
      "compare with you, hereabouts. An' this girl--she'll have all the spunk\n",
      "of the Auchinclosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then maybe she'd not be such a catch, after all,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you've no cause to love them, that's sure. But, Milt, the\n",
      "Auchincloss women are always good wives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Auntie, you're dreamin',” said Dale, soberly. “I want no wife. I'm\n",
      "happy in the woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Air you goin' to live like an Injun all your days, Milt Dale?” she\n",
      "queried, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to be ashamed. But some lass will change you, boy, an' mebbe\n",
      "it'll be this Helen Rayner. I hope an' pray so to thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Auntie, supposin' she did change me. She'd never change old Al. He\n",
      "hates me, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I ain't so sure, Milt. I met Al the other day. He inquired for\n",
      "you, an' said you was wild, but he reckoned men like you was good for\n",
      "pioneer settlements. Lord knows the good turns you've done this village!\n",
      "Milt, old Al doesn't approve of your wild life, but he never had no hard\n",
      "feelin's till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Auntie, I don't believe Tom ever killed Al's sheep,” declared Dale,\n",
      "positively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Al thinks so, an' many other people,” replied Mrs. Cass, shaking\n",
      "her gray head doubtfully. “You never swore he didn't. An' there was them\n",
      "two sheep-herders who did swear they seen him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They only saw a cougar. An' they were so scared they ran.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who wouldn't? Thet big beast is enough to scare any one. For land's\n",
      "sakes, don't ever fetch him down here again! I'll never forgit the time\n",
      "you did. All the folks an' children an' hosses in Pine broke an' run\n",
      "thet day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; but Tom wasn't to blame. Auntie, he's the tamest of my pets.\n",
      "Didn't he try to put his head on your lap an' lick your hand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt, I ain't gainsayin' your cougar pet didn't act better 'n a\n",
      "lot of people I know. Fer he did. But the looks of him an' what's been\n",
      "said was enough for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' what's all that, Auntie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say he's wild when out of your sight. An' thet he'd trail an' kill\n",
      "anythin' you put him after.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I trained him to be just that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, leave Tom to home up in the woods--when you visit us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale finished his hearty meal, and listened awhile longer to the old\n",
      "woman's talk; then, taking his rifle and the other turkey, he bade her\n",
      "good-by. She followed him out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Milt, you'll come soon again, won't you--jest to see Al's\n",
      "niece--who'll be here in a week?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I'll drop in some day.... Auntie, have you seen my friends,\n",
      "the Mormon boys?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I 'ain't seen them an' don't want to,” she retorted. “Milt Dale, if\n",
      "any one ever corrals you it'll be Mormons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't worry, Auntie. I like those boys. They often see me up in the\n",
      "woods an' ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh\n",
      "meat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They're workin' for Beasley now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that so?” rejoined Dale, with a sudden start. “An' what doin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley is gettin' so rich he's buildin' a fence, an' didn't have\n",
      "enough help, so I hear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley gettin' rich!” repeated Dale, thoughtfully. “More sheep an'\n",
      "horses an' cattle than ever, I reckon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laws-a'-me! Why, Milt, Beasley 'ain't any idea what he owns. Yes, he's\n",
      "the biggest man in these parts, since poor old Al's took to failin'. I\n",
      "reckon Al's health ain't none improved by Beasley's success. They've bad\n",
      "some bitter quarrels lately--so I hear. Al ain't what he was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale bade good-by again to his old friend and strode away, thoughtful\n",
      "and serious. Beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent, but he\n",
      "would be dangerous to oppose. There did not appear much doubt of his\n",
      "driving his way rough-shod to the dominance of affairs there in Pine.\n",
      "Dale, passing down the road, began to meet acquaintances who had\n",
      "hearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings, so that his\n",
      "pondering was interrupted for the time being. He carried the turkey to\n",
      "another old friend, and when he left her house he went on to the village\n",
      "store. This was a large log cabin, roughly covered with clapboards, with\n",
      "a wide plank platform in front and a hitching-rail in the road. Several\n",
      "horses were standing there, and a group of lazy, shirt-sleeved loungers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be doggoned if it ain't Milt Dale!” exclaimed one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Milt, old buckskin! Right down glad to see you,” greeted\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Dale! You air shore good for sore eyes,” drawled still another.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long period of absence Dale always experienced a singular warmth\n",
      "of feeling when he met these acquaintances. It faded quickly when he got\n",
      "back to the intimacy of his woodland, and that was because the people of\n",
      "Pine, with few exceptions--though they liked him and greatly admired his\n",
      "outdoor wisdom--regarded him as a sort of nonentity. Because he loved\n",
      "the wild and preferred it to village and range life, they had classed\n",
      "him as not one of them. Some believed him lazy; others believed him\n",
      "shiftless; others thought him an Indian in mind and habits; and there\n",
      "were many who called him slow-witted. Then there was another side to\n",
      "their regard for him, which always afforded him good-natured amusement.\n",
      "Two of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison; another\n",
      "wanted to hunt with him. Lem Harden came out of the store and appealed\n",
      "to Dale to recover his stolen horse. Lem's brother wanted a wild-running\n",
      "mare tracked and brought home. Jesse Lyons wanted a colt broken, and\n",
      "broken with patience, not violence, as was the method of the hard-riding\n",
      "boys at Pine. So one and all they besieged Dale with their selfish\n",
      "needs, all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures. And\n",
      "on the moment there happened by two women whose remarks, as they entered\n",
      "the store, bore strong testimony to Dale's personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there ain't Milt Dale!” exclaimed the older of the two. “How lucky!\n",
      "My cow's sick, an' the men are no good doctorin'. I'll jest ask Milt\n",
      "over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one like Milt!” responded the other woman, heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day there--you Milt Dale!” called the first speaker. “When you git\n",
      "away from these lazy men come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale never refused a service, and that was why his infrequent visits to\n",
      "Pine were wont to be prolonged beyond his own pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Beasley strode down the street, and when about to enter the\n",
      "store he espied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hullo there, Milt!” he called, cordially, as he came forward with\n",
      "extended hand. His greeting was sincere, but the lightning glance he\n",
      "shot over Dale was not born of his pleasure. Seen in daylight, Beasley\n",
      "was a big, bold, bluff man, with strong, dark features. His aggressive\n",
      "presence suggested that he was a good friend and a bad enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook hands with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you, Beasley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain't complainin', Milt, though I got more work than I can rustle.\n",
      "Reckon you wouldn't take a job bossin' my sheep-herders?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I wouldn't,” replied Dale. “Thanks all the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's goin' on up in the woods?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plenty of turkey an' deer. Lots of bear, too. The Indians have worked\n",
      "back on the south side early this fall. But I reckon winter will come\n",
      "late an' be mild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good! An' where 're you headin' from?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Cross-country from my camp,” replied Dale, rather evasively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your camp! Nobody ever found that yet,” declared Beasley, gruffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's up there,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you've got that cougar chained in your cabin door?” queried\n",
      "Beasley, and there was a barely distinguishable shudder of his muscular\n",
      "frame. Also the pupils dilated in his hard brown eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom ain't chained. An' I haven't no cabin, Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean to tell me that big brute stays in your camp without bein'\n",
      "hog-tied or corralled!” demanded Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure he does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beats me! But, then, I'm queer on cougars. Have had many a cougar trail\n",
      "me at night. Ain't sayin' I was scared. But I don't care for that brand\n",
      "of varmint.... Milt, you goin' to stay down awhile?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'll hang around some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come over to the ranch. Glad to see you any time. Some old huntin'\n",
      "pards of yours are workin' for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks, Beasley. I reckon I'll come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley turned away and took a step, and then, as if with an\n",
      "after-thought, he wheeled again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose you've heard about old Al Auchincloss bein' near petered out?”\n",
      " queried Beasley. A strong, ponderous cast of thought seemed to emanate\n",
      "from his features. Dale divined that Beasley's next step would be to\n",
      "further his advancement by some word or hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Widow Cass was tellin' me all the news. Too bad about old Al,” replied\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure is. He's done for. An' I'm sorry--though Al's never been square--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley,” interrupted Dale, quickly, “you can't say that to me. Al\n",
      "Auchincloss always was the whitest an' squarest man in this sheep\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley gave Dale a fleeting, dark glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, what you think ain't goin' to influence feelin' on this range,”\n",
      " returned Beasley, deliberately. “You live in the woods an'--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon livin' in the woods I might think--an' know a whole lot,”\n",
      " interposed Dale, just as deliberately. The group of men exchanged\n",
      "surprised glances. This was Milt Dale in different aspect. And Beasley\n",
      "did not conceal a puzzled surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About what--now?” he asked, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, about what's goin' on in Pine,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the men laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore lots goin' on--an' no mistake,” put in Lem Harden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the keen Beasley had never before considered Milt Dale as a\n",
      "responsible person; certainly never one in any way to cross his trail.\n",
      "But on the instant, perhaps, some instinct was born, or he divined an\n",
      "antagonism in Dale that was both surprising and perplexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, I've differences with Al Auchincloss--have had them for years,”\n",
      " said Beasley. “Much of what he owns is mine. An' it's goin' to come to\n",
      "me. Now I reckon people will be takin' sides--some for me an' some for\n",
      "Al. Most are for me.... Where do you stand? Al Auchincloss never had no\n",
      "use for you, an' besides he's a dyin' man. Are you goin' on his side?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I reckon I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'm glad you've declared yourself,” rejoined Beasley, shortly,\n",
      "and he strode away with the ponderous gait of a man who would brush any\n",
      "obstacle from his path.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, thet's bad--makin' Beasley sore at you,” said Lem Harden. “He's\n",
      "on the way to boss this outfit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's sure goin' to step into Al's boots,” said another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet was white of Milt to stick up fer poor old Al,” declared Lem's\n",
      "brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale broke away from them and wended a thoughtful way down the road. The\n",
      "burden of what he knew about Beasley weighed less heavily upon him, and\n",
      "the close-lipped course he had decided upon appeared wisest. He needed\n",
      "to think before undertaking to call upon old Al Auchincloss; and to that\n",
      "end he sought an hour's seclusion under the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER III\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon, Dale, having accomplished some tasks imposed upon him\n",
      "by his old friends at Pine, directed slow steps toward the Auchincloss\n",
      "ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The flat, square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon\n",
      "a little hill half a mile out of the village. A home as well as a fort,\n",
      "it had been the first structure erected in that region, and the process\n",
      "of building had more than once been interrupted by Indian attacks.\n",
      "The Apaches had for some time, however, confined their fierce raids to\n",
      "points south of the White Mountain range. Auchincloss's house looked\n",
      "down upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes, and\n",
      "hundreds of acres of well-cultivated soil. Fields of oats waved gray and\n",
      "yellow in the afternoon sun; an immense green pasture was divided by a\n",
      "willow-bordered brook, and here were droves of horses, and out on the\n",
      "rolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of\n",
      "man. The brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the\n",
      "village. Water for the house, however, came down from the high, wooded\n",
      "slope of the mountain, and had been brought there by a simple expedient.\n",
      "Pine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end, with a deep trough\n",
      "cut in them, and they made a shining line down the slope, across the\n",
      "valley, and up the little hill to the Auchincloss home. Near the house\n",
      "the hollowed halves of logs had been bound together, making a crude\n",
      "pipe. Water ran uphill in this case, one of the facts that made the\n",
      "ranch famous, as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small\n",
      "boys of Pine. The two good women who managed Auchincloss's large\n",
      "household were often shocked by the strange things that floated into\n",
      "their kitchen with the ever-flowing stream of clear, cold mountain\n",
      "water.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happened this day Dale encountered Al Auchincloss sitting in the\n",
      "shade of a porch, talking to some of his sheep-herders and stockmen.\n",
      "Auchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width\n",
      "of shoulder. He had no gray hairs, and he did not look old, yet there\n",
      "was in his face a certain weariness, something that resembled sloping\n",
      "lines of distress, dim and pale, that told of age and the ebb-tide of\n",
      "vitality. His features, cast in large mold, were clean-cut and comely,\n",
      "and he had frank blue eyes, somewhat sad, yet still full of spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had no idea how his visit would be taken, and he certainly would\n",
      "not have been surprised to be ordered off the place. He had not set foot\n",
      "there for years. Therefore it was with surprise that he saw Auchincloss\n",
      "wave away the herders and take his entrance without any particular\n",
      "expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Al! How are you?” greeted Dale, easily, as he leaned his rifle\n",
      "against the log wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss did not rise, but he offered his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt Dale, I reckon this is the first time I ever seen you that I\n",
      "couldn't lay you flat on your back,” replied the rancher. His tone was\n",
      "both testy and full of pathos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I take it you mean you ain't very well,” replied Dale. “I'm sorry, Al.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it ain't thet. Never was sick in my life. I'm just played out, like\n",
      "a hoss thet had been strong an' willin', an' did too much.... Wal, you\n",
      "don't look a day older, Milt. Livin' in the woods rolls over a man's\n",
      "head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'm feelin' fine, an' time never bothers me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, mebbe you ain't such a fool, after all. I've wondered\n",
      "lately--since I had time to think.... But, Milt, you don't git no\n",
      "richer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, I have all I want an' need.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, then, you don't support anybody; you don't do any good in the\n",
      "world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don't agree, Al,” replied Dale, with his slow smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon we never did.... An' you jest come over to pay your respects to\n",
      "me, eh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not altogether,” answered Dale, ponderingly. “First off, I'd like to\n",
      "say I'll pay back them sheep you always claimed my tame cougar killed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will! An' how'd you go about that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't very many sheep, was there?\n",
      "\n",
      "“A matter of fifty head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So many! Al, do you still think old Tom killed them sheep?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! Milt, I know damn well he did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, now how could you know somethin' I don't? Be reasonable, now. Let's\n",
      "don't fall out about this again. I'll pay back the sheep. Work it out--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt Dale, you'll come down here an' work out that fifty head of\n",
      "sheep!” ejaculated the old rancher, incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'll be damned!” He sat back and gazed with shrewd eyes at Dale.\n",
      "“What's got into you, Milt? Hev you heard about my niece thet's comin',\n",
      "an' think you'll shine up to her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Al, her comin' has a good deal to do with my deal,” replied Dale,\n",
      "soberly. “But I never thought to shine up to her, as you hint.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! You're just like all the other colts hereabouts. Reckon it's\n",
      "a good sign, too. It'll take a woman to fetch you out of the woods. But,\n",
      "boy, this niece of mine, Helen Rayner, will stand you on your head.\n",
      "I never seen her. They say she's jest like her mother. An' Nell\n",
      "Auchincloss--what a girl she was!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale felt his face grow red. Indeed, this was strange conversation for\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Honest, Al--” he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Son, don't lie to an old man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lie! I wouldn't lie to any one. Al, it's only men who live in towns an'\n",
      "are always makin' deals. I live in the forest, where there's nothin' to\n",
      "make me lie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, no offense meant, I'm sure,” responded Auchincloss. “An' mebbe\n",
      "there's somethin' in what you say... We was talkin' about them sheep\n",
      "your big cat killed. Wal, Milt, I can't prove it, that's sure. An' mebbe\n",
      "you'll think me doddery when I tell you my reason. It wasn't what them\n",
      "greaser herders said about seein' a cougar in the herd.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was it, then?” queried Dale, much interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet day a year ago I seen your pet. He was lyin' in front of the\n",
      "store an' you was inside tradin', fer supplies, I reckon. It was like\n",
      "meetin' an enemy face to face. Because, damn me if I didn't know that\n",
      "cougar was guilty when he looked in my eyes! There!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old rancher expected to be laughed at. But Dale was grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, I know how you felt,” he replied, as if they were discussing an\n",
      "action of a human being. “Sure I'd hate to doubt old Tom. But he's a\n",
      "cougar. An' the ways of animals are strange... Anyway, Al, I'll make\n",
      "good the loss of your sheep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you won't,” rejoined Auchincloss, quickly. “We'll call it off. I'm\n",
      "takin' it square of you to make the offer. Thet's enough. So forget your\n",
      "worry about work, if you had any.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There's somethin' else, Al, I wanted to say,” began Dale, with\n",
      "hesitation. “An' it's about Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss started violently, and a flame of red shot into his face.\n",
      "Then he raised a big hand that shook. Dale saw in a flash how the old\n",
      "man's nerves had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't mention--thet--thet greaser--to me!” burst out the rancher. “It\n",
      "makes me see--red.... Dale, I ain't overlookin' that you spoke up fer\n",
      "me to-day--stood fer my side. Lem Harden told me. I was glad. An' thet's\n",
      "why--to-day--I forgot our old quarrel.... But not a word about thet\n",
      "sheep-thief--or I'll drive you off the place!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Al--be reasonable,” remonstrated Dale. “It's necessary thet I\n",
      "speak of--of Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't. Not to me. I won't listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you'll have to, Al,” returned Dale. “Beasley's after your\n",
      "property. He's made a deal--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By Heaven! I know that!” shouted Auchincloss, tottering up, with his\n",
      "face now black-red. “Do you think thet's new to me? Shut up, Dale! I\n",
      "can't stand it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Al--there's worse,” went on Dale, hurriedly. “Worse! Your life's\n",
      "threatened--an' your niece, Helen--she's to be--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up--an' clear out!” roared Auchincloss, waving his huge fists.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed on the verge of a collapse as, shaking all over, he backed\n",
      "into the door. A few seconds of rage had transformed him into a pitiful\n",
      "old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Al--I'm your friend--” began Dale, appealingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friend, hey?” returned the rancher, with grim, bitter passion. “Then\n",
      "you're the only one.... Milt Dale, I'm rich an' I'm a dyin' man. I trust\n",
      "nobody... But, you wild hunter--if you're my friend--prove it!... Go\n",
      "kill thet greaser sheep-thief! DO somethin'--an' then come talk to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he lurched, half falling, into the house, and slammed the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood there for a blank moment, and then, taking up his rifle, he\n",
      "strode away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward sunset Dale located the camp of his four Mormon friends, and\n",
      "reached it in time for supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "John, Roy, Joe, and Hal Beeman were sons of a pioneer Mormon who had\n",
      "settled the little community of Snowdrop. They were young men in years,\n",
      "but hard labor and hard life in the open had made them look matured.\n",
      "Only a year's difference in age stood between John and Roy, and between\n",
      "Roy and Joe, and likewise Joe and Hal. When it came to appearance they\n",
      "were difficult to distinguish from one another. Horsemen, sheep-herders,\n",
      "cattle-raisers, hunters--they all possessed long, wiry, powerful frames,\n",
      "lean, bronzed, still faces, and the quiet, keen eyes of men used to the\n",
      "open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their camp was situated beside a spring in a cove surrounded by aspens,\n",
      "some three miles from Pine; and, though working for Beasley, near\n",
      "the village, they had ridden to and fro from camp, after the habit of\n",
      "seclusion peculiar to their kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale and the brothers had much in common, and a warm regard had sprang\n",
      "up. But their exchange of confidences had wholly concerned things\n",
      "pertaining to the forest. Dale ate supper with them, and talked as usual\n",
      "when he met them, without giving any hint of the purpose forming in his\n",
      "mind. After the meal he helped Joe round up the horses, hobble them for\n",
      "the night, and drive them into a grassy glade among the pines. Later,\n",
      "when the shadows stole through the forest on the cool wind, and the\n",
      "camp-fire glowed comfortably, Dale broached the subject that possessed\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' so you're working for Beasley?” he queried, by way of starting\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We was,” drawled John. “But to-day, bein' the end of our month, we got\n",
      "our pay an' quit. Beasley sure was sore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why'd you knock off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "John essayed no reply, and his brothers all had that quiet, suppressed\n",
      "look of knowledge under restraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen to what I come to tell you, then you'll talk,” went on Dale. And\n",
      "hurriedly he told of Beasley's plot to abduct Al Auchincloss's niece and\n",
      "claim the dying man's property.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Dale ended, rather breathlessly, the Mormon boys sat without any\n",
      "show of surprise or feeling. John, the eldest, took up a stick and\n",
      "slowly poked the red embers of the fire, making the white sparks fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Milt, why'd you tell us thet?” he asked, guardedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're the only friends I've got,” replied Dale. “It didn't seem safe\n",
      "for me to talk down in the village. I thought of you boys right off. I\n",
      "ain't goin' to let Snake Anson get that girl. An' I need help, so I come\n",
      "to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley's strong around Pine, an' old Al's weakenin'. Beasley will git\n",
      "the property, girl or no girl,” said John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Things don't always turn out as they look. But no matter about that.\n",
      "The girl deal is what riled me.... She's to arrive at Magdalena on\n",
      "the sixteenth, an' take stage for Snowdrop.... Now what to do? If she\n",
      "travels on that stage I'll be on it, you bet. But she oughtn't to be in\n",
      "it at all. ... Boys, somehow I'm goin' to save her. Will you help me? I\n",
      "reckon I've been in some tight corners for you. Sure, this 's different.\n",
      "But are you my friends? You know now what Beasley is. An' you're all\n",
      "lost at the hands of Snake Anson's gang. You've got fast hosses, eyes\n",
      "for trackin', an' you can handle a rifle. You're the kind of fellows I'd\n",
      "want in a tight pinch with a bad gang. Will you stand by me or see me go\n",
      "alone?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then John Beeman, silently, and with pale face, gave Dale's hand a\n",
      "powerful grip, and one by one the other brothers rose to do likewise.\n",
      "Their eyes flashed with hard glint and a strange bitterness hovered\n",
      "around their thin lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, mebbe we know what Beasley is better 'n you,” said John, at\n",
      "length. “He ruined my father. He's cheated other Mormons. We boys have\n",
      "proved to ourselves thet he gets the sheep Anson's gang steals.... An'\n",
      "drives the herds to Phenix! Our people won't let us accuse Beasley. So\n",
      "we've suffered in silence. My father always said, let some one else say\n",
      "the first word against Beasley, an' you've come to us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Beeman put a hand on Dale's shoulder. He, perhaps, was the keenest\n",
      "of the brothers and the one to whom adventure and peril called most.\n",
      "He had been oftenest with Dale, on many a long trail, and he was the\n",
      "hardest rider and the most relentless tracker in all that range country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' we're goin' with you,” he said, in a strong and rolling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "They resumed their seats before the fire. John threw on more wood, and\n",
      "with a crackling and sparkling the blaze curled up, fanned by the wind.\n",
      "As twilight deepened into night the moan in the pines increased to a\n",
      "roar. A pack of coyotes commenced to pierce the air in staccato cries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five young men conversed long and earnestly, considering, planning,\n",
      "rejecting ideas advanced by each. Dale and Roy Beeman suggested most of\n",
      "what became acceptable to all. Hunters of their type resembled explorers\n",
      "in slow and deliberate attention to details. What they had to deal with\n",
      "here was a situation of unlimited possibilities; the horses and outfit\n",
      "needed; a long detour to reach Magdalena unobserved; the rescue of a\n",
      "strange girl who would no doubt be self-willed and determined to ride\n",
      "on the stage--the rescue forcible, if necessary; the fight and the\n",
      "inevitable pursuit; the flight into the forest, and the safe delivery of\n",
      "the girl to Auchincloss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, Milt, will we go after Beasley?” queried Roy Beeman,\n",
      "significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale was silent and thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sufficient unto the day!” said John. “An' fellars, let's go to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rolled out their tarpaulins, Dale sharing Roy's blankets, and soon\n",
      "were asleep, while the red embers slowly faded, and the great roar of\n",
      "wind died down, and the forest stillness set in.\n",

      "CHAPTER IV\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twenty-four\n",
      "hours before she made an alarming discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accompanied by her sister Bo, a precocious girl of sixteen, Helen had\n",
      "left St. Joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at\n",
      "home, yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life\n",
      "in the Far West. All her people had the pioneer spirit; love of change,\n",
      "action, adventure, was in her blood. Then duty to a widowed mother\n",
      "with a large and growing family had called to Helen to accept this rich\n",
      "uncle's offer. She had taught school and also her little brothers and\n",
      "sisters; she had helped along in other ways. And now, though the\n",
      "tearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard, this opportunity was\n",
      "irresistible in its call. The prayer of her dreams had been answered. To\n",
      "bring good fortune to her family; to take care of this beautiful, wild\n",
      "little sister; to leave the yellow, sordid, humdrum towns for the great,\n",
      "rolling, boundless open; to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day\n",
      "to be her own; to have fulfilled a deep, instinctive, and undeveloped\n",
      "love of horses, cattle, sheep, of desert and mountain, of trees and\n",
      "brooks and wild flowers--all this was the sum of her most passionate\n",
      "longings, now in some marvelous, fairylike way to come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "A check to her happy anticipations, a blank, sickening dash of cold\n",
      "water upon her warm and intimate dreams, had been the discovery\n",
      "that Harve Riggs was on the train. His presence could mean only one\n",
      "thing--that he had followed her. Riggs had been the worst of many\n",
      "sore trials back there in St. Joseph. He had possessed some claim or\n",
      "influence upon her mother, who favored his offer of marriage to Helen;\n",
      "he was neither attractive, nor good, nor industrious, nor anything that\n",
      "interested her; he was the boastful, strutting adventurer, not genuinely\n",
      "Western, and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety. Helen had\n",
      "suspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his,\n",
      "and also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be bad--as\n",
      "Western men were bad. But on the train, in the station at La Junta, one\n",
      "glimpse of him, manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of\n",
      "her sight, warned Helen that she now might have a problem on her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recognition sobered her. All was not to be a road of roses to this\n",
      "new home in the West. Riggs would follow her, if he could not accompany\n",
      "her, and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything. Helen felt the\n",
      "startling realization of being cast upon her own resources, and then\n",
      "a numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness. But these\n",
      "feelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her\n",
      "temper. Opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to\n",
      "it. She would not have been Al Auchincloss's niece if she had faltered.\n",
      "And, when temper was succeeded by genuine anger, she could have laughed\n",
      "to scorn this Harve Riggs and his schemes, whatever they were. Once\n",
      "and for all she dismissed fear of him. When she left St. Joseph she had\n",
      "faced the West with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of\n",
      "that West. Homes had to be made out there in that far country, so Uncle\n",
      "Al had written, and women were needed to make homes. She meant to be one\n",
      "of these women and to make of her sister another. And with the thought\n",
      "that she would know definitely what to say to Riggs when he approached\n",
      "her, sooner or later, Helen dismissed him from mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the train was in motion, enabling Helen to watch the ever-changing\n",
      "scenery, and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping Bo well in\n",
      "hand at stations, she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests\n",
      "and the red, rocky gullies and the dim, bold mountains. She saw the sun\n",
      "set over distant ranges of New Mexico--a golden blaze of glory, as new\n",
      "to her as the strange fancies born in her, thrilling and fleeting by.\n",
      "Bo's raptures were not silent, and the instant the sun sank and the\n",
      "color faded she just as rapturously importuned Helen to get out the huge\n",
      "basket of food they had brought from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had two seats, facing each other, at the end of the coach, and\n",
      "piled there, with the basket on top, was luggage that constituted all\n",
      "the girls owned in the world. Indeed, it was very much more than they\n",
      "had ever owned before, because their mother, in her care for them and\n",
      "desire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle, had spent\n",
      "money and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls sat together, with the heavy basket on their knees, and ate\n",
      "while they gazed out at the cool, dark ridges. The train clattered\n",
      "slowly on, apparently over a road that was all curves. And it was\n",
      "supper-time for everybody in that crowded coach. If Helen had not been\n",
      "so absorbed by the great, wild mountain-land she would have had more\n",
      "interest in the passengers. As it was she saw them, and was amused\n",
      "and thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car, all\n",
      "middle-class people, poor and hopeful, traveling out there to the New\n",
      "West to find homes. It was splendid and beautiful, this fact, yet it\n",
      "inspired a brief and inexplicable sadness. From the train window, that\n",
      "world of forest and crag, with its long bare reaches between, seemed so\n",
      "lonely, so wild, so unlivable. How endless the distance! For hours and\n",
      "miles upon miles no house, no hut, no Indian tepee! It was amazing, the\n",
      "length and breadth of this beautiful land. And Helen, who loved brooks\n",
      "and running streams, saw no water at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then darkness settled down over the slow-moving panorama; a cool night\n",
      "wind blew in at the window; white stars began to blink out of the blue.\n",
      "The sisters, with hands clasped and heads nestled together, went to\n",
      "sleep under a heavy cloak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Early the next morning, while the girls were again delving into their\n",
      "apparently bottomless basket, the train stopped at Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! Look!” cried Bo, in thrilling voice. “Cowboys! Oh, Nell, look!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen, laughing, looked first at her sister, and thought how most of all\n",
      "she was good to look at. Bo was little, instinct with pulsating life,\n",
      "and she had chestnut hair and dark-blue eyes. These eyes were flashing,\n",
      "roguish, and they drew like magnets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside on the rude station platform were railroad men, Mexicans, and\n",
      "a group of lounging cowboys. Long, lean, bow-legged fellows they were,\n",
      "with young, frank faces and intent eyes. One of them seemed particularly\n",
      "attractive with his superb build, his red-bronze face and bright-red\n",
      "scarf, his swinging gun, and the huge, long, curved spurs. Evidently\n",
      "he caught Bo's admiring gaze, for, with a word to his companions, he\n",
      "sauntered toward the window where the girls sat. His gait was singular,\n",
      "almost awkward, as if he was not accustomed to walking. The long spurs\n",
      "jingled musically. He removed his sombrero and stood at ease, frank,\n",
      "cool, smiling. Helen liked him on sight, and, looking to see what effect\n",
      "he had upon Bo, she found that young lady staring, frightened stiff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good mawnin',” drawled the cowboy, with slow, good-humored smile. “Now\n",
      "where might you-all be travelin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of his voice, the clean-cut and droll geniality; seemed new\n",
      "and delightful to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We go to Magdalena--then take stage for the White Mountains,” replied\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy's still, intent eyes showed surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Apache country, miss,” he said. “I reckon I'm sorry. Thet's shore no\n",
      "place for you-all... Beggin' your pawdin--you ain't Mormons?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. We're nieces of Al Auchincloss,” rejoined Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you don't say! I've been down Magdalena way an' heerd of Al....\n",
      "Reckon you're goin' a-visitin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's to be home for us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore thet's fine. The West needs girls.... Yes, I've heerd of Al.\n",
      "An old Arizona cattle-man in a sheep country! Thet's bad.... Now I'm\n",
      "wonderin'--if I'd drift down there an' ask him for a job ridin' for\n",
      "him--would I get it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal\n",
      "water. The gaze he bent upon Bo somehow pleased Helen. The last year or\n",
      "two, since Bo had grown prettier all the time, she had been a magnet for\n",
      "admiring glances. This one of the cowboy's inspired respect and liking,\n",
      "as well as amusement. It certainly was not lost upon Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My uncle once said in a letter that he never had enough men to run his\n",
      "ranch,” replied Helen, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'll go. I reckon I'd jest naturally drift that way--now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed so laconic, so easy, so nice, that he could not have been\n",
      "taken seriously, yet Helen's quick perceptions registered a daring, a\n",
      "something that was both sudden and inevitable in him. His last word was\n",
      "as clear as the soft look he fixed upon Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had a mischievous trait, which, subdue it as she would,\n",
      "occasionally cropped out; and Bo, who once in her wilful life had been\n",
      "rendered speechless, offered such a temptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe my little sister will put in a good word for you--to Uncle Al,”\n",
      " said Helen. Just then the train jerked, and started slowly. The cowboy\n",
      "took two long strides beside the car, his heated boyish face almost on a\n",
      "level with the window, his eyes, now shy and a little wistful, yet bold,\n",
      "too, fixed upon Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-by--Sweetheart!” he called.\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted--was lost to view.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” ejaculated Helen, contritely, half sorry, half amused. “What a\n",
      "sudden young gentleman!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had blushed beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, wasn't he glorious!” she burst out, with eyes shining.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd hardly call him that, but he was--nice,” replied Helen, much\n",
      "relieved that Bo had apparently not taken offense at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared plain that Bo resisted a frantic desire to look out of the\n",
      "window and to wave her hand. But she only peeped out, manifestly to her\n",
      "disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think he--he'll come to Uncle Al's?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Child, he was only in fun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll bet you he comes. Oh, it'd be great! I'm going to love\n",
      "cowboys. They don't look like that Harve Riggs who ran after you so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen sighed, partly because of the reminder of her odious suitor, and\n",
      "partly because Bo's future already called mysteriously to the child.\n",
      "Helen had to be at once a mother and a protector to a girl of intense\n",
      "and wilful spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the trainmen directed the girls' attention to a green, sloping\n",
      "mountain rising to a bold, blunt bluff of bare rock; and, calling\n",
      "it Starvation Peak, he told a story of how Indians had once driven\n",
      "Spaniards up there and starved them. Bo was intensely interested, and\n",
      "thereafter she watched more keenly than ever, and always had a question\n",
      "for a passing trainman. The adobe houses of the Mexicans pleased her,\n",
      "and, then the train got out into Indian country, where pueblos appeared\n",
      "near the track and Indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild\n",
      "mustangs--then she was enraptured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But these Indians are peaceful!” she exclaimed once, regretfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracious, child! You don't want to see hostile Indians, do you?”\n",
      " queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do, you bet,” was the frank rejoinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'LL bet that I'll be sorry I didn't leave you with mother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--you never will!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They reached Albuquerque about noon, and this important station, where\n",
      "they had to change trains, had been the first dreaded anticipation of\n",
      "the journey. It certainly was a busy place--full of jabbering Mexicans,\n",
      "stalking, red-faced, wicked-looking cowboys, lolling Indians. In the\n",
      "confusion Helen would have been hard put to it to preserve calmness,\n",
      "with Bo to watch, and all that baggage to carry, and the other train to\n",
      "find; but the kindly brakeman who had been attentive to them now helped\n",
      "them off the train into the other--a service for which Helen was very\n",
      "grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Albuquerque's a hard place,” confided the trainman. “Better stay in the\n",
      "car--and don't hang out the windows.... Good luck to you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a few passengers were in the car and they were Mexicans at the\n",
      "forward end. This branch train consisted of one passenger-coach, with a\n",
      "baggage-car, attached to a string of freight-cars. Helen told herself,\n",
      "somewhat grimly, that soon she would know surely whether or not her\n",
      "suspicions of Harve Riggs had warrant. If he was going on to Magdalena\n",
      "on that day he must go in this coach. Presently Bo, who was not obeying\n",
      "admonitions, drew her head out of the window. Her eyes were wide in\n",
      "amaze, her mouth open.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! I saw that man Riggs!” she whispered. “He's going to get on this\n",
      "train.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I saw him yesterday,” replied Helen, soberly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's followed you--the--the--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Bo, don't get excited,” remonstrated Helen. “We've left home now.\n",
      "We've got to take things as they come. Never mind if Riggs has followed\n",
      "me. I'll settle him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Then you won't speak--have anything to do with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't if I can help it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Other passengers boarded the train, dusty, uncouth, ragged men, and\n",
      "some hard-featured, poorly clad women, marked by toil, and several more\n",
      "Mexicans. With bustle and loud talk they found their several seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen saw Harve Riggs enter, burdened with much luggage. He was a\n",
      "man of about medium height, of dark, flashy appearance, cultivating long\n",
      "black mustache and hair. His apparel was striking, as it consisted of\n",
      "black frock-coat, black trousers stuffed in high, fancy-topped boots,\n",
      "an embroidered vest, and flowing tie, and a black sombrero. His belt and\n",
      "gun were prominent. It was significant that he excited comment among the\n",
      "other passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself,\n",
      "and, turning abruptly, approached the seat occupied by the girls. When\n",
      "he reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite, took off\n",
      "his sombrero, and deliberately looked at Helen. His eyes were light,\n",
      "glinting, with hard, restless quiver, and his mouth was coarse and\n",
      "arrogant. Helen had never seen him detached from her home surroundings,\n",
      "and now the difference struck cold upon her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Nell!” he said. “Surprised to see me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she replied, coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll gamble you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, I told you the day before I left home that nothing you\n",
      "could do or say mattered to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon that ain't so, Nell. Any woman I keep track of has reason to\n",
      "think. An' you know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you followed me--out here?” demanded Helen, and her voice, despite\n",
      "her control, quivered with anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sure did,” he replied, and there was as much thought of himself in\n",
      "the act as there was of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why? Why? It's useless--hopeless.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I swore I'd have you, or nobody else would,” he replied, and here, in\n",
      "the passion of his voice there sounded egotism rather than hunger for\n",
      "a woman's love. “But I reckon I'd have struck West anyhow, sooner or\n",
      "later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're not going to--all the way--to Pine?” faltered Helen, momentarily\n",
      "weakening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll camp on your trail from now on,” he declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Bo sat bolt-upright, with pale face and flashing eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, you leave Nell alone,” she burst out, in ringing, brave\n",
      "young voice. “I'll tell you what--I'll bet--if you follow her and\n",
      "nag her any more, my uncle Al or some cowboy will run you out of the\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Pepper!” replied Riggs, coolly. “I see your manners haven't\n",
      "improved an' you're still wild about cowboys.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“People don't have good manners with--with--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, hush!” admonished Helen. It was difficult to reprove Bo just then,\n",
      "for that young lady had not the slightest fear of Riggs. Indeed, she\n",
      "looked as if she could slap his face. And Helen realized that however\n",
      "her intelligence had grasped the possibilities of leaving home for a\n",
      "wild country, and whatever her determination to be brave, the actual\n",
      "beginning of self-reliance had left her spirit weak. She would rise\n",
      "out of that. But just now this flashing-eyed little sister seemed a\n",
      "protector. Bo would readily adapt herself to the West, Helen thought,\n",
      "because she was so young, primitive, elemental.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Bo turned her back to Riggs and looked out of the window. The\n",
      "man laughed. Then he stood up and leaned over Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm goin' wherever you go,” he said, steadily. “You can take that\n",
      "friendly or not, just as it pleases you. But if you've got any sense\n",
      "you'll not give these people out here a hunch against me. I might hurt\n",
      "somebody.... An' wouldn't it be better--to act friends? For I'm goin' to\n",
      "look after you, whether you like it or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had considered this man an annoyance, and later a menace, and now\n",
      "she must declare open enmity with him. However disgusting the idea that\n",
      "he considered himself a factor in her new life, it was the truth. He\n",
      "existed, he had control over his movements. She could not change that.\n",
      "She hated the need of thinking so much about him; and suddenly, with a\n",
      "hot, bursting anger, she hated the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll not look after me. I'll take care of myself,” she said, and\n",
      "she turned her back upon him. She heard him mutter under his breath and\n",
      "slowly move away down the car. Then Bo slipped a hand in hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind, Nell,” she whispered. “You know what old Sheriff Haines\n",
      "said about Harve Riggs. 'A four-flush would-be gun-fighter! If he ever\n",
      "strikes a real Western town he'll get run out of it.' I just wish my\n",
      "red-faced cowboy had got on this train!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt a rush of gladness that she had yielded to Bo's wild\n",
      "importunities to take her West. The spirit which had made Bo\n",
      "incorrigible at home probably would make her react happily to life out\n",
      "in this free country. Yet Helen, with all her warmth and gratefulness,\n",
      "had to laugh at her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your red-faced cowboy! Why, Bo, you were scared stiff. And now you\n",
      "claim him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly could love that fellow,” replied Bo, dreamily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Child, you've been saying that about fellows for a long time. And\n",
      "you've never looked twice at any of them yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was different.... Nell, I'll bet he comes to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope he does. I wish he was on this train. I liked his looks, Bo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Nell dear, he looked at ME first and last--so don't get your\n",
      "hopes up.... Oh, the train's starting!... Good-by, Albu-ker--what's that\n",
      "awful name?... Nell, let's eat dinner. I'm starved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen forgot her troubles and the uncertain future, and what with\n",
      "listening to Bo's chatter, and partaking again of the endless good\n",
      "things to eat in the huge basket, and watching the noble mountains, she\n",
      "drew once more into happy mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valley of the Rio Grande opened to view, wide near at hand in a\n",
      "great gray-green gap between the bare black mountains, narrow in the\n",
      "distance, where the yellow river wound away, glistening under a hot\n",
      "sun. Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican children that\n",
      "darted into adobe huts as the train clattered by, and she exclaimed her\n",
      "pleasure in the Indians, and the mustangs, and particularly in a group\n",
      "of cowboys riding into town on spirited horses. Helen saw all Bo pointed\n",
      "out, but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung\n",
      "longest, and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something\n",
      "from her. She had never before experienced any feeling like that; she\n",
      "had never seen a tenth so far. And the sight awoke something strange\n",
      "in her. The sun was burning hot, as she could tell when she put a hand\n",
      "outside the window, and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the\n",
      "train. She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest\n",
      "were the sun and the dust and the wind. And her realization made her\n",
      "love them. It was there; the open, the wild, the beautiful, the lonely\n",
      "land; and she felt the poignant call of blood in her--to seek, to\n",
      "strive, to find, to live. One look down that yellow valley, endless\n",
      "between its dark iron ramparts, had given her understanding of her\n",
      "uncle. She must be like him in spirit, as it was claimed she resembled\n",
      "him otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life, and,\n",
      "with her bright head on the faded cloak, she went to sleep. But Helen\n",
      "kept steady, farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain; and\n",
      "during the long hours, as she watched through clouds of dust and veils\n",
      "of heat, some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to\n",
      "change and then to fix. It was her physical acceptance--her eyes and her\n",
      "senses taking the West as she had already taken it in spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman should love her home wherever fate placed her, Helen believed,\n",
      "and not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living. How\n",
      "could life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous\n",
      "vastness of bare earth and open sky, where the need to achieve made\n",
      "thinking and pondering superficial?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the Rio\n",
      "Grande, and then of its paralleled mountain ranges. But the miles\n",
      "brought compensation in other valleys, other bold, black upheavals of\n",
      "rock, and then again bare, boundless yellow plains, and sparsely cedared\n",
      "ridges, and white dry washes, ghastly in the sunlight, and dazzling\n",
      "beds of alkali, and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers\n",
      "bloomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She noted, too, that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had\n",
      "begun to shade to red--and this she knew meant an approach to\n",
      "Arizona. Arizona, the wild, the lonely, the red desert, the green\n",
      "plateau--Arizona with its thundering rivers, its unknown spaces, its\n",
      "pasture-lands and timber-lands, its wild horses, cowboys, outlaws,\n",
      "wolves and lions and savages! As to a boy, that name stirred and\n",
      "thrilled and sang to her of nameless, sweet, intangible things,\n",
      "mysterious and all of adventure. But she, being a girl of twenty, who\n",
      "had accepted responsibilities, must conceal the depths of her heart and\n",
      "that which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being\n",
      "born a boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed, while Helen watched and learned and dreamed. The train\n",
      "stopped, at long intervals, at wayside stations where there seemed\n",
      "nothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans, and dust and heat. Bo awoke\n",
      "and began to chatter, and to dig into the basket. She learned from the\n",
      "conductor that Magdalena was only two stations on. And she was full of\n",
      "conjectures as to who would meet them, what would happen. So Helen was\n",
      "drawn back to sober realities, in which there was considerable zest.\n",
      "Assuredly she did not know what was going to happen. Twice Riggs passed\n",
      "up and down the aisle, his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile\n",
      "deliberately forced upon her sight. But again Helen fought a growing\n",
      "dread with contemptuous scorn. This fellow was not half a man. It was\n",
      "not conceivable what he could do, except annoy her, until she arrived\n",
      "at Pine. Her uncle was to meet her or send for her at Snowdrop, which\n",
      "place, Helen knew, was distant a good long ride by stage from Magdalena.\n",
      "This stage-ride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey, in\n",
      "Helen's considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell!” cried Bo, with delight. “We're nearly there! Next station,\n",
      "the conductor said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder if the stage travels at night,” said Helen, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure it does!” replied the irrepressible Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The train, though it clattered along as usual, seemed to Helen to fly.\n",
      "There the sun was setting over bleak New Mexican bluffs, Magdalena was\n",
      "at hand, and night, and adventure. Helen's heart beat fast. She\n",
      "watched the yellow plains where the cattle grazed; their presence, and\n",
      "irrigation ditches and cottonwood-trees told her that the railroad part\n",
      "of the journey was nearly ended. Then, at Bo's little scream, she\n",
      "looked across the car and out of the window to see a line of low, flat,\n",
      "red-adobe houses. The train began to slow down. Helen saw children run,\n",
      "white children and Mexican together; then more houses, and high upon a\n",
      "hill an immense adobe church, crude and glaring, yet somehow beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen told Bo to put on her bonnet, and, performing a like office for\n",
      "herself, she was ashamed of the trembling of her fingers. There were\n",
      "bustle and talk in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "The train stopped. Helen peered out to see a straggling crowd of\n",
      "Mexicans and Indians, all motionless and stolid, as if trains or nothing\n",
      "else mattered. Next Helen saw a white man, and that was a relief. He\n",
      "stood out in front of the others. Tall and broad, somehow striking, he\n",
      "drew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in gray-fringed\n",
      "buckskin, and carrying a rifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER V\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, there was no kindly brakeman to help the sisters with their\n",
      "luggage. Helen bade Bo take her share; thus burdened, they made an\n",
      "awkward and laborious shift to get off the train.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the platform of the car a strong hand seized Helen's heavy bag,\n",
      "with which she was straining, and a loud voice called out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, we're here--sure out in the wild an' woolly West!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was Riggs, and he had possessed himself of part of her\n",
      "baggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious\n",
      "crowd than to be really kind. In the excitement of arriving Helen\n",
      "had forgotten him. The manner of sudden reminder--the insincerity of\n",
      "it--made her temper flash. She almost fell, encumbered as she was, in\n",
      "her hurry to descend the steps. She saw the tall hunter in gray step\n",
      "forward close to her as she reached for the bag Riggs held.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Riggs, I'll carry my bag,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me lug this. You help Bo with hers,” he replied, familiarly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I want it,” she rejoined, quietly, with sharp determination. No\n",
      "little force was needed to pull the bag away from Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See here, Helen, you ain't goin' any farther with that joke, are you?”\n",
      " he queried, deprecatingly, and he still spoke quite loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's no joke to me,” replied Helen. “I told you I didn't want your\n",
      "attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. But that was temper. I'm your friend--from your home town. An' I\n",
      "ain't goin' to let a quarrel keep me from lookin' after you till you're\n",
      "safe at your uncle's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen turned her back upon him. The tall hunter had just helped Bo off\n",
      "the car. Then Helen looked up into a smooth bronzed face and piercing\n",
      "gray eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you Helen Rayner?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name's Dale. I've come to meet you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! My uncle sent you?” added Helen, in quick relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I can't say Al sent me,” began the man, “but I reckon--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was interrupted by Riggs, who, grasping Helen by the arm, pulled her\n",
      "back a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, mister, did Auchincloss send you to meet my young friends here?”\n",
      " he demanded, arrogantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's glance turned from Helen to Riggs. She could not read this quiet\n",
      "gray gaze, but it thrilled her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I come on my own hook,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll understand, then--they're in my charge,” added Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time the steady light-gray eyes met Helen's, and if there was not a\n",
      "smile in them or behind them she was still further baffled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Helen, I reckon you said you didn't want this fellow's attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly said that,” replied Helen, quickly. Just then Bo slipped\n",
      "close to her and gave her arm a little squeeze. Probably Bo's thought\n",
      "was like hers--here was a real Western man. That was her first\n",
      "impression, and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased\n",
      "nerves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs swaggered closer to Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Buckskin, I hail from Texas--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're wastin' our time an' we've need to hurry,” interrupted Dale. His\n",
      "tone seemed friendly. “An' if you ever lived long in Texas you wouldn't\n",
      "pester a lady an' you sure wouldn't talk like you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” shouted Riggs, hotly. He dropped his right hand significantly to\n",
      "his hip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't throw your gun. It might go off,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever Riggs's intention had been--and it was probably just what Dale\n",
      "evidently had read it--he now flushed an angry red and jerked at his\n",
      "gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's hand flashed too swiftly for Helen's eye to follow it. But she\n",
      "heard the thud as it struck. The gun went flying to the platform and\n",
      "scattered a group of Indians and Mexicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll hurt yourself some day,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had never heard a slow, cool voice like this hunter's. Without\n",
      "excitement or emotion or hurry, it yet seemed full and significant of\n",
      "things the words did not mean. Bo uttered a strange little exultant cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs's arm had dropped limp. No doubt it was numb. He stared, and his\n",
      "predominating expression was surprise. As the shuffling crowd began to\n",
      "snicker and whisper, Riggs gave Dale a malignant glance, shifted it to\n",
      "Helen, and then lurched away in the direction of his gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale did not pay any more attention to him. Gathering up Helen's\n",
      "baggage, he said, “Come on,” and shouldered a lane through the gaping\n",
      "crowd. The girls followed close at his heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! what 'd I tell you?” whispered Bo. “Oh, you're all atremble!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was aware of her unsteadiness; anger and fear and relief in quick\n",
      "succession had left her rather weak. Once through the motley crowd\n",
      "of loungers, she saw an old gray stage-coach and four lean horses. A\n",
      "grizzled, sunburned man sat on the driver's seat, whip and reins in\n",
      "hand. Beside him was a younger man with rifle across his knees. Another\n",
      "man, young, tall, lean, dark, stood holding the coach door open. He\n",
      "touched his sombrero to the girls. His eyes were sharp as he addressed\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, wasn't you held up?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But some long-haired galoot was tryin' to hold up the girls.\n",
      "Wanted to throw his gun on me. I was sure scared,” replied Dale, as he\n",
      "deposited the luggage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo laughed. Her eyes, resting upon Dale, were warm and bright. The\n",
      "young man at the coach door took a second look at her, and then a smile\n",
      "changed the dark hardness of his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale helped the girls up the high step into the stage, and then, placing\n",
      "the lighter luggage, in with them, he threw the heavier pieces on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joe, climb up,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt,” drawled the driver, “let's ooze along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale hesitated, with his hand on the door. He glanced at the crowd, now\n",
      "edging close again, and then at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I ought to tell you,” he said, and indecision appeared to\n",
      "concern him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” exclaimed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad news. But talkin' takes time. An' we mustn't lose any.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There's need of hurry?” queried Helen, sitting up sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is this the stage to Snowdrop?\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. That leaves in the mornin'. We rustled this old trap to get a start\n",
      "to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sooner the better. But I--I don't understand,” said Helen,\n",
      "bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It'll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin' stage,” returned Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Safe! Oh, what do you mean?” exclaimed Helen. Apprehensively she gazed\n",
      "at him and then back at Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Explainin' will take time. An' facts may change your mind. But if you\n",
      "can't trust me--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trust you!” interposed Helen, blankly. “You mean to take us to\n",
      "Snowdrop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon we'd better go roundabout an' not hit Snowdrop,” he replied,\n",
      "shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then to Pine--to my uncle--Al Auchincloss?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'm goin' to try hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen caught her breath. She divined that some peril menaced her. She\n",
      "looked steadily, with all a woman's keenness, into this man's face. The\n",
      "moment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the West had in store\n",
      "for her. Her future and that of Bo's were now to be dependent upon her\n",
      "judgments. It was a hard moment and, though she shivered inwardly, she\n",
      "welcomed the initial and inevitable step. This man Dale, by his dress of\n",
      "buckskin, must be either scout or hunter. His size, his action, the tone\n",
      "of his voice had been reassuring. But Helen must decide from what she\n",
      "saw in his face whether or not to trust him. And that face was\n",
      "clear bronze, unlined, unshadowed, like a tranquil mask, clean-cut,\n",
      "strong-jawed, with eyes of wonderful transparent gray.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'll trust you,” she said. “Get in, and let us hurry. Then you can\n",
      "explain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All ready, Bill. Send 'em along,” called Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to stoop to enter the stage, and, once in, he appeared to fill\n",
      "that side upon which he sat. Then the driver cracked his whip; the\n",
      "stage lurched and began to roll; the motley crowd was left behind. Helen\n",
      "awakened to the reality, as she saw Bo staring with big eyes at the\n",
      "hunter, that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began\n",
      "with the rattling roll of that old stage-coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward, holding his rifle between\n",
      "his knees. The light shone better upon his features now that he was\n",
      "bareheaded. Helen had never seen a face like that, which at first glance\n",
      "appeared darkly bronzed and hard, and then became clear, cold, aloof,\n",
      "still, intense. She wished she might see a smile upon it. And now that\n",
      "the die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it. There was\n",
      "singular force in it, but she did not recognize what kind of force. One\n",
      "instant she thought it was stern, and the next that it was sweet, and\n",
      "again that it was neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm glad you've got your sister,” he said, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did you know she's my sister?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon she looks like you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one else ever thought so,” replied Helen, trying to smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had no difficulty in smiling, as she said, “Wish I was half as pretty\n",
      "as Nell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell. Isn't your name Helen?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. But my--some few call me Nell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I like Nell better than Helen. An' what's yours?” went on Dale, looking\n",
      "at Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine's Bo. Just plain B-o. Isn't it silly? But I wasn't asked when they\n",
      "gave it to me,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo. It's nice an' short. Never heard it before. But I haven't met many\n",
      "people for years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! we've left the town!” cried Bo. “Look, Nell! How bare! It's just\n",
      "like desert.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is desert. We've forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a\n",
      "tree.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen glanced out. A flat, dull-green expanse waved away from the road\n",
      "on and on to a bright, dark horizon-line, where the sun was setting\n",
      "rayless in a clear sky. Open, desolate, and lonely, the scene gave her a\n",
      "cold thrill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did your uncle Al ever write anythin' about a man named Beasley?” asked\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed he did,” replied Helen, with a start of surprise. “Beasley! That\n",
      "name is familiar to us--and detestable. My uncle complained of this man\n",
      "for years. Then he grew bitter--accused Beasley. But the last year or so\n",
      "not a word!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, now,” began the hunter, earnestly, “let's get the bad news over.\n",
      "I'm sorry you must be worried. But you must learn to take the West as it\n",
      "is. There's good an' bad, maybe more bad. That's because the country's\n",
      "young.... So to come right out with it--this Beasley hired a gang of\n",
      "outlaws to meet the stage you was goin' in to Snowdrop--to-morrow--an'\n",
      "to make off with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make off with me?” ejaculated Helen, bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kidnap you! Which, in that gang, would be worse than killing you!”\n",
      " declared Dale, grimly, and he closed a huge fist on his knee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was utterly astounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How hor-rible!” she gasped out. “Make off with me!... What in Heaven's\n",
      "name for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo gave vent to a fierce little utterance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For reasons you ought to guess,” replied Dale, and he leaned forward\n",
      "again. Neither his voice nor face changed in the least, but yet there\n",
      "was a something about him that fascinated Helen. “I'm a hunter. I live\n",
      "in the woods. A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm\n",
      "an' I took to an old log cabin. Soon as I got there I heard horses.\n",
      "I hid up in the loft. Some men rode up an' come in. It was dark. They\n",
      "couldn't see me. An' they talked. It turned out they were Snake Anson\n",
      "an' his gang of sheep-thieves. They expected to meet Beasley there.\n",
      "Pretty soon he came. He told Anson how old Al, your uncle, was on his\n",
      "last legs--how he had sent for you to have his property when he died.\n",
      "Beasley swore he had claims on Al. An' he made a deal with Anson to get\n",
      "you out of the way. He named the day you were to reach Magdalena. With\n",
      "Al dead an' you not there, Beasley could get the property. An' then he\n",
      "wouldn't care if you did come to claim it. It 'd be too late.... Well,\n",
      "they rode away that night. An' next day I rustled down to Pine. They're\n",
      "all my friends at Pine, except old Al. But they think I'm queer. I\n",
      "didn't want to confide in many people. Beasley is strong in Pine, an'\n",
      "for that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides\n",
      "Beasley. So I went to see your uncle. He never had any use for me\n",
      "because he thought I was lazy like an Indian. Old Al hates lazy men.\n",
      "Then we fell out--or he fell out--because he believed a tame lion of\n",
      "mine had killed some of his sheep. An' now I reckon that Tom might have\n",
      "done it. I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasley's about you, but\n",
      "old Al wouldn't listen. He's cross--very cross. An' when I tried to tell\n",
      "him, why, he went right out of his head. Sent me off the ranch. Now I\n",
      "reckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in. Finally I went to four\n",
      "friends I could trust. They're Mormon boys--brothers. That's Joe out\n",
      "on top, with the driver. I told them all about Beasley's deal an' asked\n",
      "them to help me. So we planned to beat Anson an' his gang to Magdalena.\n",
      "It happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine.\n",
      "An' we had to go careful. But the boys had a couple of friends\n",
      "here--Mormons, too, who agreed to help us. They had this old stage....\n",
      "An' here you are.” Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at\n",
      "Helen and then at Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're perfectly splendid!” cried Bo, ringingly. She was white; her\n",
      "fingers were clenched; her eyes blazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale appeared startled out of his gravity, and surprised, then pleased.\n",
      "A smile made his face like a boy's. Helen felt her body all rigid, yet\n",
      "slightly trembling. Her hands were cold. The horror of this revelation\n",
      "held her speechless. But in her heart she echoed Bo's exclamation of\n",
      "admiration and gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far, then,” resumed Dale, with a heavy breath of relief. “No wonder\n",
      "you're upset. I've a blunt way of talkin'.... Now we've thirty miles to\n",
      "ride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off. To-day sometime the\n",
      "rest of the boys--Roy, John, an' Hal--were to leave Show Down, which's\n",
      "a town farther on from Snowdrop. They have my horses an' packs besides\n",
      "their own. Somewhere on the road we'll meet them--to-night, maybe--or\n",
      "tomorrow. I hope not to-night, because that 'd mean Anson's gang was\n",
      "ridin' in to Magdalena.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen wrung her hands helplessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, have I no courage?” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm as scared as you are,” said Bo, consolingly, embracing her\n",
      "sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon that's natural,” said Dale, as if excusing them. “But, scared\n",
      "or not, you both brace up. It's a bad job. But I've done my best. An'\n",
      "you'll be safer with me an' the Beeman boys than you'd be in Magdalena,\n",
      "or anywhere else, except your uncle's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.--Mr. Dale,” faltered Helen, with her tears falling, “don't think me\n",
      "a coward--or--or ungrateful. I'm neither. It's only I'm so--so shocked.\n",
      "After all we hoped and expected--this--this--is such a--a terrible\n",
      "surprise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind, Nell dear. Let's take what comes,” murmured Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's the talk,” said Dale. “You see, I've come right out with the\n",
      "worst. Maybe we'll get through easy. When we meet the boys we'll take to\n",
      "the horses an' the trails. Can you ride?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo has been used to horses all her life and I ride fairly well,”\n",
      " responded Helen. The idea of riding quickened her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good! We may have some hard ridin' before I get you up to Pine. Hello!\n",
      "What's that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Above the creaking, rattling, rolling roar of the stage Helen heard a\n",
      "rapid beat of hoofs. A horse flashed by, galloping hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale opened the door and peered out. The stage rolled to a halt. He\n",
      "stepped down and gazed ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joe, who was that?” he queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nary me. An' Bill didn't know him, either,” replied Joe. “I seen him\n",
      "'way back. He was ridin' some. An' he slowed up goin' past us. Now he's\n",
      "runnin' again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook his head as if he did not like the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, he'll never get by Roy on this road,” said Joe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe he'll get by before Roy strikes in on the road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't likely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not restrain her fears. “Mr. Dale, you think he was a\n",
      "messenger--going ahead to post that--that Anson gang?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might be,” replied Dale, simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the young man called Joe leaned out from the seat above and called:\n",
      "“Miss Helen, don't you worry. Thet fellar is more liable to stop lead\n",
      "than anythin' else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His words, meant to be kind and reassuring, were almost as sinister to\n",
      "Helen as the menace to her own life. Long had she known how cheap life\n",
      "was held in the West, but she had only known it abstractly, and she had\n",
      "never let the fact remain before her consciousness. This cheerful young\n",
      "man spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf. The thought it roused\n",
      "was tragic--for bloodshed was insupportable to her--and then the thrills\n",
      "which followed were so new, strange, bold, and tingling that they were\n",
      "revolting. Helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths, of instincts at\n",
      "which she was amazed and ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joe, hand down that basket of grub--the small one with the canteen,”\n",
      " said Dale, reaching out a long arm. Presently he placed a cloth-covered\n",
      "basket inside the stage. “Girls, eat all you want an' then some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have a basket half full yet,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll need it all before we get to Pine.... Now, I'll ride up on top\n",
      "with the boys an' eat my supper. It'll be dark, presently, an' we'll\n",
      "stop often to listen. But don't be scared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he took his rifle and, closing the door, clambered up to the\n",
      "driver's seat. Then the stage lurched again and began to roll along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the least thing to wonder at of this eventful evening was the way Bo\n",
      "reached for the basket of food. Helen simply stared at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you CAN'T EAT!” she exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should smile I can,” replied that practical young lady. “And you're\n",
      "going to if I have to stuff things in your mouth. Where's your wits,\n",
      "Nell? He said we must eat. That means our strength is going to have some\n",
      "pretty severe trials.... Gee! it's all great--just like a story! The\n",
      "unexpected--why, he looks like a prince turned hunter!--long, dark,\n",
      "stage journey--held up--fight--escape--wild ride on horses--woods\n",
      "and camps and wild places--pursued--hidden in the forest--more hard\n",
      "rides--then safe at the ranch. And of course he falls madly in love with\n",
      "me--no, you, for I'll be true to my Las Vegas lover--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, silly! Bo, tell me, aren't you SCARED?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scared! I'm scared stiff. But if Western girls stand such things, we\n",
      "can. No Western girl is going to beat ME!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That brought Helen to a realization of the brave place she had given\n",
      "herself in dreams, and she was at once ashamed of herself and wildly\n",
      "proud of this little sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, thank Heaven I brought you with me!” exclaimed Helen, fervently.\n",
      "“I'll eat if it chokes me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon she found herself actually hungry, and while she ate she\n",
      "glanced out of the stage, first from one side and then from the other.\n",
      "These windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in.\n",
      "The sun had long since sunk. Out to the west, where a bold, black\n",
      "horizon-line swept away endlessly, the sky was clear gold, shading\n",
      "to yellow and blue above. Stars were out, pale and wan, but growing\n",
      "brighter. The earth appeared bare and heaving, like a calm sea. The wind\n",
      "bore a fragrance new to Helen, acridly sweet and clean, and it was so\n",
      "cold it made her fingers numb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard some animal yelp,” said Bo, suddenly, and she listened with\n",
      "head poised.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Helen heard nothing save the steady clip-clop of hoofs, the clink of\n",
      "chains, the creak and rattle of the old stage, and occasionally the low\n",
      "voices of the men above.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls had satisfied hunger and thirst, night had settled down\n",
      "black. They pulled the cloaks up over them, and close together leaned\n",
      "back in a corner of the seat and talked in whispers. Helen did not have\n",
      "much to say, but Bo was talkative.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This beats me!” she said once, after an interval. “Where are we, Nell?\n",
      "Those men up there are Mormons. Maybe they are abducting us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dale isn't a Mormon,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could tell by the way he spoke of his friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I wish it wasn't so dark. I'm not afraid of men in daylight....\n",
      "Nell, did you ever see such a wonderful looking fellow? What'd they call\n",
      "him? Milt--Milt Dale. He said he lived in the woods. If I hadn't fallen\n",
      "in love with that cowboy who called me--well, I'd be a goner now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After an interval of silence Bo whispered, startlingly, “Wonder if Harve\n",
      "Riggs is following us now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course he is,” replied Helen, hopelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He'd better look out. Why, Nell, he never saw--he never--what did Uncle\n",
      "Al used to call it?--sav--savvied--that's it. Riggs never savvied that\n",
      "hunter. But I did, you bet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Savvied! What do you mean, Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean that long-haired galoot never saw his real danger. But I felt\n",
      "it. Something went light inside me. Dale never took him seriously at\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs will turn up at Uncle Al's, sure as I'm born,” said Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him turn,” replied Bo, contemptuously. “Nell, don't you ever bother\n",
      "your head again about him. I'll bet they're all men out here. And I\n",
      "wouldn't be in Harve Riggs's boots for a lot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After that Bo talked of her uncle and his fatal illness, and from that\n",
      "she drifted back to the loved ones at home, now seemingly at the other\n",
      "side of the world, and then she broke down and cried, after which she\n",
      "fell asleep on Helen's shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Helen could not have fallen asleep if she had wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had always, since she could remember, longed for a moving, active\n",
      "life; and for want of a better idea she had chosen to dream of gipsies.\n",
      "And now it struck her grimly that, if these first few hours of her\n",
      "advent in the West were forecasts of the future, she was destined to\n",
      "have her longings more than fulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the stage rolled slower and slower, until it came to a halt.\n",
      "Then the horses heaved, the harnesses clinked, the men whispered.\n",
      "Otherwise there was an intense quiet. She looked out, expecting to\n",
      "find it pitch-dark. It was black, yet a transparent blackness. To her\n",
      "surprise she could see a long way. A shooting-star electrified her.\n",
      "The men were listening. She listened, too, but beyond the slight sounds\n",
      "about the stage she heard nothing. Presently the driver clucked to his\n",
      "horses, and travel was resumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a while the stage rolled on rapidly, evidently downhill, swaying\n",
      "from side to side, and rattling as if about to fall to pieces. Then it\n",
      "slowed on a level, and again it halted for a few moments, and once more\n",
      "in motion it began a laborsome climb. Helen imagined miles had been\n",
      "covered. The desert appeared to heave into billows, growing rougher, and\n",
      "dark, round bushes dimly stood out. The road grew uneven and rocky, and\n",
      "when the stage began another descent its violent rocking jolted Bo out\n",
      "of her sleep and in fact almost out of Helen's arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where am I?” asked Bo, dazedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you're having your heart's desire, but I can't tell you where you\n",
      "are,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo awakened thoroughly, which fact was now no wonder, considering the\n",
      "jostling of the old stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on to me, Nell!... Is it a runaway?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We've come about a thousand miles like this, I think,” replied Helen.\n",
      "“I've not a whole bone in my body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo peered out of the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, how dark and lonesome! But it'd be nice if it wasn't so cold. I'm\n",
      "freezing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you loved cold air,” taunted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Nell, you begin to talk like yourself,” responded Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was difficult to hold on to the stage and each other and the cloak\n",
      "all at once, but they succeeded, except in the roughest places, when\n",
      "from time to time they were bounced around. Bo sustained a sharp rap on\n",
      "the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oooooo!” she moaned. “Nell Rayner, I'll never forgive you for fetching\n",
      "me on this awful trip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just think of your handsome Las Vegas cowboy,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either this remark subdued Bo or the suggestion sufficed to reconcile\n",
      "her to the hardships of the ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, as they talked and maintained silence and tried to sleep, the\n",
      "driver of the stage kept at his task after the manner of Western men who\n",
      "knew how to get the best out of horses and bad roads and distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by the stage halted again and remained at a standstill for so\n",
      "long, with the men whispering on top, that Helen and Bo were roused to\n",
      "apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a sharp whistle came from the darkness ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's Roy,” said Joe Beeman, in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon. An' meetin' us so quick looks bad,” replied Dale. “Drive on,\n",
      "Bill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe it seems quick to you,” muttered the driver, “but if we hain't\n",
      "come thirty mile, an' if thet ridge thar hain't your turnin'-off place,\n",
      "why, I don't know nothin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stage rolled on a little farther, while Helen and Bo sat clasping\n",
      "each other tight, wondering with bated breath what was to be the next\n",
      "thing to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then once more they were at a standstill. Helen heard the thud of boots\n",
      "striking the ground, and the snorts of horses.\n",

      "“Nell, I see horses,” whispered Bo, excitedly. “There, to the side of\n",
      "the road... and here comes a man.... Oh, if he shouldn't be the one\n",
      "they're expecting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen peered out to see a tall, dark form, moving silently, and beyond\n",
      "it a vague outline of horses, and then pale gleams of what must have\n",
      "been pack-loads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale loomed up, and met the stranger in the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Milt? You got the girl sure, or you wouldn't be here,” said a\n",
      "low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, I've got two girls--sisters,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man Roy whistled softly under his breath. Then another lean, rangy\n",
      "form strode out of the darkness, and was met by Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, boys--how about Anson's gang?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At Snowdrop, drinkin' an' quarrelin'. Reckon they'll leave there about\n",
      "daybreak,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long have you been here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe a couple of hours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any horse go by?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, a strange rider passed us before dark. He was hittin' the road.\n",
      "An' he's got by here before you came.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't like thet news,” replied Roy, tersely. “Let's rustle. With\n",
      "girls on hossback you'll need all the start you can get. Hey, John?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake Anson shore can foller hoss tracks,” replied the third man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, say the word,” went on Roy, as he looked up at the stars.\n",
      "“Daylight not far away. Here's the forks of the road, an' your hosses,\n",
      "an' our outfit. You can be in the pines by sunup.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the silence that ensued Helen heard the throb of her heart and\n",
      "the panting little breaths of her sister. They both peered out, hands\n",
      "clenched together, watching and listening in strained attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's possible that rider last night wasn't a messenger to Anson,” said\n",
      "Dale. “In that case Anson won't make anythin' of our wheel tracks or\n",
      "horse tracks. He'll go right on to meet the regular stage. Bill, can you\n",
      "go back an' meet the stage comin' before Anson does?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckon so--an' take it easy at thet,” replied Bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” continued Dale, instantly. “John, you an' Joe an' Hal ride\n",
      "back to meet the regular stage. An' when you meet it get on an' be on it\n",
      "when Anson holds it up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's shore agreeable to me,” drawled John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd like to be on it, too,” said Roy, grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'll need you till I'm safe in the woods. Bill, hand down the bags.\n",
      "An' you, Roy, help me pack them. Did you get all the supplies I wanted?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore did. If the young ladies ain't powerful particular you can feed\n",
      "them well for a couple of months.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale wheeled and, striding to the stage, he opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, you're not asleep? Come,” he called.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo stepped down first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was asleep till this--this vehicle fell off the road back a ways,”\n",
      " she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Beeman's low laugh was significant. He took off his sombrero and\n",
      "stood silent. The old driver smothered a loud guffaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Veehicle! Wal, I'll be doggoned! Joe, did you hear thet? All the spunky\n",
      "gurls ain't born out West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Helen followed with cloak and bag Roy assisted her, and she\n",
      "encountered keen eyes upon her face. He seemed both gentle and\n",
      "respectful, and she felt his solicitude. His heavy gun, swinging low,\n",
      "struck her as she stepped down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale reached into the stage and hauled out baskets and bags. These he\n",
      "set down on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turn around, Bill, an' go along with you. John an' Hal will follow\n",
      "presently,” ordered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, gurls,” said Bill, looking down upon them, “I was shore powerful\n",
      "glad to meet you-all. An' I'm ashamed of my country--offerin' two sich\n",
      "purty gurls insults an' low-down tricks. But shore you'll go through\n",
      "safe now. You couldn't be in better company fer ridin' or huntin' or\n",
      "marryin' or gittin' religion--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up, you old grizzly!” broke in Dale, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! Good-by, gurls, an' good luck!” ended Bill, as he began to\n",
      "whip the reins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo said good-by quite distinctly, but Helen could only murmur hers. The\n",
      "old driver seemed a friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the horses wheeled and stamped, the stage careened and creaked,\n",
      "presently to roll out of sight in the gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're shiverin',” said Dale, suddenly, looking down upon Helen. She\n",
      "felt his big, hard hand clasp hers. “Cold as ice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am c-cold,” replied Helen. “I guess we're not warmly dressed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, we roasted all day, and now we're freezing,” declared Bo. “I\n",
      "didn't know it was winter at night out here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, haven't you some warm gloves an' a coat?” asked Roy, anxiously.\n",
      "“It 'ain't begun to get cold yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, we've heavy gloves, riding-suits and boots--all fine and new--in\n",
      "this black bag,” said Bo, enthusiastically kicking a bag at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, so we have. But a lot of good they'll do us, to-night,” returned\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, you'd do well to change right here,” said Roy, earnestly. “It'll\n",
      "save time in the long run an' a lot of sufferin' before sunup.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen stared at the young man, absolutely amazed with his simplicity.\n",
      "She was advised to change her traveling-dress for a riding-suit--out\n",
      "somewhere in a cold, windy desert--in the middle of the night--among\n",
      "strange young men!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, which bag is it?” asked Dale, as if she were his sister. And when\n",
      "she indicated the one, he picked it up. “Come off the road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo followed him, and Helen found herself mechanically at their heels.\n",
      "Dale led them a few paces off the road behind some low bushes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hurry an' change here,” he said. “We'll make a pack of your outfit an'\n",
      "leave room for this bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he stalked away and in a few strides disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo sat down to begin unlacing her shoes. Helen could just see her pale,\n",
      "pretty face and big, gleaming eyes by the light of the stars. It struck\n",
      "her then that Bo was going to make eminently more of a success of\n",
      "Western life than she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, those fellows are n-nice,” said Bo, reflectively. “Aren't you\n",
      "c-cold? Say, he said hurry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was beyond Helen's comprehension how she ever began to disrobe out\n",
      "there in that open, windy desert, but after she had gotten launched on\n",
      "the task she found that it required more fortitude than courage. The\n",
      "cold wind pierced right through her. Almost she could have laughed at\n",
      "the way Bo made things fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“G-g-g-gee!” chattered Bo. “I n-never w-was so c-c-cold in all my life.\n",
      "Nell Rayner, m-may the g-good Lord forgive y-you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was too intent on her own troubles to take breath to talk. She was\n",
      "a strong, healthy girl, swift and efficient with her hands, yet this,\n",
      "the hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced, almost overcame\n",
      "her. Bo outdistanced her by moments, helped her with buttons, and laced\n",
      "one whole boot for her. Then, with hands that stung, Helen packed the\n",
      "traveling-suits in the bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! But what an awful mess!” exclaimed Helen. “Oh, Bo, our pretty\n",
      "traveling-dresses!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll press them t-to-morrow--on a l-log,” replied Bo, and she giggled.\n",
      "\n",
      "They started for the road. Bo, strange to note, did not carry her share\n",
      "of the burden, and she seemed unsteady on her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men were waiting beside a group of horses, one of which carried a\n",
      "pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothin' slow about you,” said Dale, relieving Helen of the grip. “Roy,\n",
      "put them up while I sling on this bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy led out two of the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get up,” he said, indicating Bo. “The stirrups are short on this\n",
      "saddle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was an adept at mounting, but she made such awkward and slow work of\n",
      "it in this instance that Helen could not believe her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw 're the stirrups?” asked Roy. “Stand in them. Guess they're about\n",
      "right.... Careful now! Thet hoss is skittish. Hold him in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was not living up to the reputation with which Helen had credited\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, miss, you get up,” said Roy to Helen. And in another instant she\n",
      "found herself astride a black, spirited horse. Numb with cold as she\n",
      "was, she yet felt the coursing thrills along her veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy was at the stirrups with swift hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're taller 'n I guessed,” he said. “Stay up, but lift your foot....\n",
      "Shore now, I'm glad you have them thick, soft boots. Mebbe we'll ride\n",
      "all over the White Mountains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, do you hear that?” called Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bo did not answer. She was leaning rather unnaturally in her saddle.\n",
      "Helen became anxious. Just then Dale strode back to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All cinched up, Roy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jest ready,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dale stood beside Helen. How tall he was! His wide shoulders seemed\n",
      "on a level with the pommel of her saddle. He put an affectionate hand on\n",
      "the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His name's Ranger an' he's the fastest an' finest horse in this\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon he shore is--along with my bay,” corroborated Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, if you rode Ranger he'd beat your pet,” said Dale. “We can start\n",
      "now. Roy, you drive the pack-horses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took another look at Helen's saddle and then moved to do likewise\n",
      "with Bo's.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you--all right?” he asked, quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo reeled in her seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm n-near froze,” she replied, in a faint voice. Her face shone white\n",
      "in the starlight. Helen recognized that Bo was more than cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Bo!” she called, in distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, don't you worry, now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me carry you,” suggested Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'll s-s-stick on this horse or d-die,” fiercely retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men looked up at her white face and then at each other. Then Roy\n",
      "walked away toward the dark bunch of horses off the road and Dale swung\n",
      "astride the one horse left.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep close to me,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo fell in line and Helen brought up the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen imagined she was near the end of a dream. Presently she would\n",
      "awaken with a start and see the pale walls of her little room at\n",
      "home, and hear the cherry branches brushing her window, and the old\n",
      "clarion-voiced cock proclaim the hour of dawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses trotted. And the exercise soon warmed Helen, until she was\n",
      "fairly comfortable except in her fingers. In mind, however, she grew\n",
      "more miserable as she more fully realized her situation. The night now\n",
      "became so dark that, although the head of her horse was alongside the\n",
      "flank of Bo's, she could scarcely see Bo. From time to time Helen's\n",
      "anxious query brought from her sister the answer that she was all right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had not ridden a horse for more than a year, and for several\n",
      "years she had not ridden with any regularity. Despite her thrills\n",
      "upon mounting, she had entertained misgivings. But she was agreeably\n",
      "surprised, for the horse, Ranger, had an easy gait, and she found she\n",
      "had not forgotten how to ride. Bo, having been used to riding on a farm\n",
      "near home, might be expected to acquit herself admirably. It occurred\n",
      "to Helen what a plight they would have been in but for the thick,\n",
      "comfortable riding outfits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark as the night was, Helen could dimly make out the road underneath.\n",
      "It was rocky, and apparently little used. When Dale turned off the road\n",
      "into the low brush or sage of what seemed a level plain, the traveling\n",
      "was harder, rougher, and yet no slower. The horses kept to the gait of\n",
      "the leaders. Helen, discovering it unnecessary, ceased attempting to\n",
      "guide Ranger. There were dim shapes in the gloom ahead, and always they\n",
      "gave Helen uneasiness, until closer approach proved them to be rocks\n",
      "or low, scrubby trees. These increased in both size and number as the\n",
      "horses progressed. Often Helen looked back into the gloom behind.\n",
      "This act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread. Dale\n",
      "expected to be pursued. And Helen experienced, along with the dread,\n",
      "flashes of unfamiliar resentment. Not only was there an attempt afoot\n",
      "to rob her of her heritage, but even her personal liberty. Then she\n",
      "shuddered at the significance of Dale's words regarding her possible\n",
      "abduction by this hired gang. It seemed monstrous, impossible. Yet,\n",
      "manifestly it was true enough to Dale and his allies. The West, then, in\n",
      "reality was raw, hard, inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly her horse stopped. He had come up alongside Bo's horse. Dale\n",
      "had halted ahead, and apparently was listening. Roy and the pack-train\n",
      "were out of sight in the gloom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” whispered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I heard a wolf,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was that cry a wolf's?” asked Bo. “I heard. It was wild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We're gettin' up close to the foot-hills,” said Dale. “Feel how much\n",
      "colder the air is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm warm now,” replied Bo. “I guess being near froze was what ailed\n",
      "me.... Nell, how 're you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm warm, too, but--” Helen answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you had your choice of being here or back home, snug in bed--which\n",
      "would you take?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo!” exclaimed Helen, aghast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'd choose to be right here on this horse,” rejoined Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale heard her, for he turned an instant, then slapped his horse and\n",
      "started on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen now rode beside Bo, and for a long time they climbed steadily in\n",
      "silence. Helen knew when that dark hour before dawn had passed, and she\n",
      "welcomed an almost imperceptible lightening in the east. Then the stars\n",
      "paled. Gradually a grayness absorbed all but the larger stars. The\n",
      "great white morning star, wonderful as Helen had never seen it, lost its\n",
      "brilliance and life and seemed to retreat into the dimming blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight came gradually, so that the gray desert became distinguishable\n",
      "by degrees. Rolling bare hills, half obscured by the gray lifting mantle\n",
      "of night, rose in the foreground, and behind was gray space, slowly\n",
      "taking form and substance. In the east there was a kindling of pale\n",
      "rose and silver that lengthened and brightened along a horizon growing\n",
      "visibly rugged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon we'd better catch up with Roy,” said Dale, and he spurred his\n",
      "horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger and Bo's mount needed no other urging, and they swung into a\n",
      "canter. Far ahead the pack-animals showed with Roy driving them. The\n",
      "cold wind was so keen in Helen's face that tears blurred her eyes and\n",
      "froze her cheeks. And riding Ranger at that pace was like riding in\n",
      "a rocking-chair. That ride, invigorating and exciting, seemed all too\n",
      "short.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell, I don't care--what becomes of--me!” exclaimed Bo,\n",
      "breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face was white and red, fresh as a rose, her eyes glanced darkly\n",
      "blue, her hair blew out in bright, unruly strands. Helen knew she felt\n",
      "some of the physical stimulation that had so roused Bo, and seemed so\n",
      "irresistible, but somber thought was not deflected thereby.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was clear daylight when Roy led off round a knoll from which patches\n",
      "of scrubby trees--cedars, Dale called them--straggled up on the side of\n",
      "the foot-hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They grow on the north slopes, where the snow stays longest,” said\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "They descended into a valley that looked shallow, but proved to be deep\n",
      "and wide, and then began to climb another foot-hill. Upon surmounting it\n",
      "Helen saw the rising sun, and so glorious a view confronted her that she\n",
      "was unable to answer Bo's wild exclamations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bare, yellow, cedar-dotted slopes, apparently level, so gradual was the\n",
      "ascent, stretched away to a dense ragged line of forest that rose\n",
      "black over range after range, at last to fail near the bare summit of a\n",
      "magnificent mountain, sunrise-flushed against the blue sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, beautiful!” cried Bo. “But they ought to be called Black\n",
      "Mountains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Baldy, there, is white half the year,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look back an' see what you say,” suggested Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls turned to gaze silently. Helen imagined she looked down upon\n",
      "the whole wide world. How vastly different was the desert! Verily it\n",
      "yawned away from her, red and gold near at hand, growing softly flushed\n",
      "with purple far away, a barren void, borderless and immense, where\n",
      "dark-green patches and black lines and upheaved ridges only served to\n",
      "emphasize distance and space.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See thet little green spot,” said Roy, pointing. “Thet's Snowdrop. An'\n",
      "the other one--'way to the right--thet's Show Down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is Pine?” queried Helen, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Farther still, up over the foot-hills at the edge of the woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then we're riding away from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. If we'd gone straight for Pine thet gang could overtake us. Pine\n",
      "is four days' ride. An' by takin' to the mountains Milt can hide his\n",
      "tracks. An' when he's thrown Anson off the scent, then he'll circle down\n",
      "to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dale, do you think you'll get us there safely--and soon?” asked\n",
      "Helen, wistfully.\n",

      "“Are we ever going to eat?” inquired Bo, demurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this query Roy Beeman turned with a laugh to look at Bo. Helen saw\n",
      "his face fully in the light, and it was thin and hard, darkly bronzed,\n",
      "with eyes like those of a hawk, and with square chin and lean jaws\n",
      "showing scant, light beard.\n",

      "During a steady trot for a long hour, Helen's roving eyes were\n",
      "everywhere, taking note of the things from near to far--the scant sage\n",
      "that soon gave place to as scanty a grass, and the dark blots that\n",
      "proved to be dwarf cedars, and the ravines opening out as if by magic\n",
      "from what had appeared level ground, to wind away widening between gray\n",
      "stone walls, and farther on, patches of lonely pine-trees, two and three\n",
      "together, and then a straggling clump of yellow aspens, and up beyond\n",
      "the fringed border of forest, growing nearer all the while, the black\n",
      "sweeping benches rising to the noble dome of the dominant mountain of\n",
      "the range.\n",
      "\n",
      "No birds or animals were seen in that long ride up toward the timber,\n",
      "which fact seemed strange to Helen. The air lost something of its cold,\n",
      "cutting edge as the sun rose higher, and it gained sweeter tang of\n",
      "forest-land. The first faint suggestion of that fragrance was utterly\n",
      "new to Helen, yet it brought a vague sensation of familiarity and\n",
      "with it an emotion as strange. It was as if she had smelled that keen,\n",
      "pungent tang long ago, and her physical sense caught it before her\n",
      "memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellow plain had only appeared to be level. Roy led down into a\n",
      "shallow ravine, where a tiny stream meandered, and he followed this\n",
      "around to the left, coming at length to a point where cedars and\n",
      "dwarf pines formed a little grove. Here, as the others rode up, he sat\n",
      "cross-legged in his saddle, and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll hang up awhile,” he said. “Reckon you're tired?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm hungry, but not tired yet,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen dismounted, to find that walking was something she had apparently\n",
      "lost the power to do. Bo laughed at her, but she, too, was awkward when\n",
      "once more upon the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Roy got down. Helen was surprised to find him lame. He caught her\n",
      "quick glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A hoss threw me once an' rolled on me. Only broke my collar-bone, five\n",
      "ribs, one arm, an' my bow-legs in two places!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding this evidence that he was a cripple, as he stood there\n",
      "tall and lithe in his homespun, ragged garments, he looked singularly\n",
      "powerful and capable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon walkin' around would be good for you girls,” advised Dale. “If\n",
      "you ain't stiff yet, you'll be soon. An' walkin' will help. Don't go\n",
      "far. I'll call when breakfast's ready.”\n",

      "A little while later the girls were whistled in from their walk and\n",

      "like an Indian, in front of a tarpaulin, upon which was spread a homely\n",
      "but substantial fare. Helen's quick eye detected a cleanliness and\n",
      "thoroughness she had scarcely expected to find in the camp cooking of\n",
      "men of the wilds. Moreover, the fare was good. She ate heartily, and\n",
      "as for Bo's appetite, she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as\n",
      "amused at it. The young men were all eyes, assiduous in their service\n",
      "to the girls, but speaking seldom. It was not lost upon Helen how\n",
      "Dale's gray gaze went often down across the open country. She divined\n",
      "apprehension from it rather than saw much expression in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--declare,” burst out Bo, when she could not eat any more, “this\n",
      "isn't believable. I'm dreaming.... Nell, the black horse you rode is the\n",
      "prettiest I ever saw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger, with the other animals, was grazing along the little brook.\n",
      "Packs and saddles had been removed. The men ate leisurely. There\n",
      "was little evidence of hurried flight. Yet Helen could not cast off\n",
      "uneasiness. Roy might have been deep, and careless, with a motive to\n",
      "spare the girls' anxiety, but Dale seemed incapable of anything he did\n",
      "not absolutely mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rest or walk,” he advised the girls. “We've got forty miles to ride\n",
      "before dark.”\n",

      "prying into the packs. She was curious and eager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale and Roy talked in low tones while they cleaned up the utensils and\n",
      "packed them away in a heavy canvas bag.\n",

      "“An' how do you figure that so soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How'd you figure it--if you was Snake Anson?” queried Roy, in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Depends on that rider from Magdalena,” Said Dale, soberly. “Although\n",
      "it's likely I'd seen them wheel tracks an' hoss tracks made where we\n",
      "turned off. But supposin' he does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, listen. I told you Snake met us boys face to face day before\n",
      "yesterday in Show Down. An' he was plumb curious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he missed seein' or hearin' about me,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe he did an' mebbe he didn't. Anyway, what's the difference whether\n",
      "he finds out this mornin' or this evenin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you ain't expectin' a fight if Anson holds up the stage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, he'd have to shoot first, which ain't likely. John an' Hal, since\n",
      "thet shootin'-scrape a year ago, have been sort of gun-shy. Joe might\n",
      "get riled. But I reckon the best we can be shore of is a delay. An' it'd\n",
      "be sense not to count on thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you hang up here an' keep watch for Anson's gang--say long enough\n",
      "so's to be sure they'd be in sight if they find our tracks this mornin'.\n",
      "Makin' sure one way or another, you ride 'cross-country to Big Spring,\n",
      "where I'll camp to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy nodded approval of that suggestion. Then without more words both men\n",
      "picked up ropes and went after the horses. Helen was watching Dale, so\n",
      "that when Bo cried out in great excitement Helen turned to see a savage\n",
      "yellow little mustang standing straight up on his hind legs and pawing\n",
      "the air. Roy had roped him and was now dragging him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, look at that for a wild pony!” exclaimed Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen busied herself getting well out of the way of the infuriated\n",
      "mustang. Roy dragged him to a cedar near by.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come now, Buckskin,” said Roy, soothingly, and he slowly approached the\n",
      "quivering animal. He went closer, hand over hand, on the lasso. Buckskin\n",
      "showed the whites of his eyes and also his white teeth. But he stood\n",
      "while Roy loosened the loop and, slipping it down over his head,\n",
      "fastened it in a complicated knot round his nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's a hackamore,” he said, indicating the knot. “He's never had a\n",
      "bridle, an' never will have one, I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don't ride him?” queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes I do,” replied Roy, with a smile. “Would you girls like to\n",
      "try him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me,” answered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee!” ejaculated Bo. “He looks like a devil. But I'd tackle him--if you\n",
      "think I could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wild leaven of the West had found quick root in Bo Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'm sorry, but I reckon I'll not let you--for a spell,” replied\n",
      "Roy, dryly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He pitches somethin' powerful bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pitches. You mean bucks?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next half-hour Helen saw more and learned more about how horses\n",
      "of the open range were handled than she had ever heard of. Excepting\n",
      "Ranger, and Roy's bay, and the white pony Bo rode, the rest of the\n",
      "horses had actually to be roped and hauled into camp to be saddled and\n",
      "packed. It was a job for fearless, strong men, and one that called for\n",
      "patience as well as arms of iron. So that for Helen Rayner the thing\n",
      "succeeding the confidence she had placed in these men was respect. To an\n",
      "observing woman that half-hour told much.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all was in readiness for a start Dale mounted, and said,\n",
      "significantly: “Roy, I'll look for you about sundown. I hope no sooner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, it'd be bad if I had to rustle along soon with bad news. Let's\n",
      "hope for the best. We've been shore lucky so far. Now you take to the\n",
      "pine-mats in the woods an' hide your trail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale turned away. Then the girls bade Roy good-by, and followed. Soon\n",
      "Roy and his buckskin-colored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of\n",
      "trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unhampered horses led the way; the pack-animals trotted after them;\n",
      "the riders were close behind. All traveled at a jog-trot. And this gait\n",
      "made the packs bob up and down and from side to side. The sun felt\n",
      "warm at Helen's back and the wind lost its frosty coldness, that almost\n",
      "appeared damp, for a dry, sweet fragrance. Dale drove up the shallow\n",
      "valley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of\n",
      "timber some few miles ahead. It did not take long to reach the edge of\n",
      "the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen wondered why the big pines grew so far on that plain and no\n",
      "farther. Probably the growth had to do with snow, but, as the ground\n",
      "was level, she could not see why the edge of the woods should come just\n",
      "there.\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen it seemed a strange, critical entrance into another world,\n",
      "which she was destined to know and to love. The pines were big,\n",
      "brown-barked, seamed, and knotted, with no typical conformation except\n",
      "a majesty and beauty. They grew far apart. Few small pines and little\n",
      "underbrush flourished beneath them. The floor of this forest appeared\n",
      "remarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and\n",
      "wide brown areas of pine-needles. These manifestly were what Roy\n",
      "had meant by pine-mats. Here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or\n",
      "rotting. Helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and\n",
      "the strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all, and when\n",
      "they did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log. Likewise\n",
      "she became aware of a springy nature of the ground. And then she saw\n",
      "that the pine-mats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the\n",
      "horses, and after they had passed sprang back to place again, leaving no\n",
      "track. Helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind. Indeed,\n",
      "it would take a sharp eye to follow Dale through that forest. This\n",
      "knowledge was infinitely comforting to Helen, and for the first time\n",
      "since the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind\n",
      "and heart. It left her free for some of the appreciation she might have\n",
      "had in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo, however, seemed too young, too wild, too intense to mind what the\n",
      "circumstances were. She responded to reality. Helen began to suspect\n",
      "that the girl would welcome any adventure, and Helen knew surely now\n",
      "that Bo was a true Auchincloss. For three long days Helen had felt a\n",
      "constraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar; for the last\n",
      "hours it had been submerged under dread. But it must be, she concluded,\n",
      "blood like her sister's, pounding at her veins to be set free to race\n",
      "and to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo loved action. She had an eye for beauty, but she was not\n",
      "contemplative. She was now helping Dale drive the horses and hold them\n",
      "in rather close formation. She rode well, and as yet showed no symptoms\n",
      "of fatigue or pain. Helen began to be aware of both, but not enough yet\n",
      "to limit her interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "A wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her. Of all living\n",
      "creatures in nature Helen liked birds best, and she knew many and could\n",
      "imitate the songs of a few. But here under the stately pines there were\n",
      "no birds. Squirrels, however, began to be seen here and there, and in\n",
      "the course of an hour's travel became abundant. The only one with which\n",
      "she was familiar was the chipmunk. All the others, from the slim bright\n",
      "blacks to the striped russets and the white-tailed grays, were totally\n",
      "new to her. They appeared tame and curious. The reds barked and scolded\n",
      "at the passing cavalcade; the blacks glided to some safe branch, there\n",
      "to watch; the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their\n",
      "domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Dale, halting his horse, pointed with long arm, and Helen,\n",
      "following the direction, descried several gray deer standing in a glade,\n",
      "motionless, with long ears up. They made a wild and beautiful picture.\n",
      "Suddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forest on the whole held to the level, open character, but there\n",
      "were swales and stream-beds breaking up its regular conformity. Toward\n",
      "noon, however, it gradually changed, a fact that Helen believed she\n",
      "might have observed sooner had she been more keen. The general lay of\n",
      "the land began to ascend, and the trees to grow denser.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made another discovery. Ever since she had entered the forest she\n",
      "had become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting\n",
      "her nostrils. She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But\n",
      "presently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine\n",
      "odor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch.\n",
      "The smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength.\n",
      "Also her throat and lungs seemed to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings\n",
      "it was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied\n",
      "recognition. Thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they\n",
      "grew worse. One, especially, was a pain beyond all her experience.\n",
      "It lay in the muscles of her side, above her hip, and it grew to be a\n",
      "treacherous thing, for it was not persistent. It came and went. After it\n",
      "did come, with a terrible flash, it could be borne by shifting or easing\n",
      "the body. But it gave no warning. When she expected it she was mistaken;\n",
      "when she dared to breathe again, then, with piercing swiftness,\n",
      "it returned like a blade in her side. This, then, was one of the\n",
      "riding-pains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride. It\n",
      "was almost too much to be borne. The beauty of the forest, the living\n",
      "creatures to be seen scurrying away, the time, distance--everything\n",
      "faded before that stablike pain. To her infinite relief she found that\n",
      "it was the trot that caused this torture. When Ranger walked she did not\n",
      "have to suffer it. Therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared\n",
      "or until Dale and Bo were almost out of sight; then she loped him ahead\n",
      "until he had caught up.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the hours passed, the sun got around low, sending golden shafts\n",
      "under the trees, and the forest gradually changed to a brighter, but a\n",
      "thicker, color. This slowly darkened. Sunset was not far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard the horses splashing in water, and soon she rode up to see the\n",
      "tiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss.\n",
      "She crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a\n",
      "more open place in the forest where the pines were huge, towering,\n",
      "and far apart. A low, gray bluff of stone rose to the right, perhaps\n",
      "one-third as high as the trees. From somewhere came the rushing sound of\n",
      "running water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Big Spring,” announced Dale. “We camp here. You girls have done well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another glance proved to Helen that all those little streams poured from\n",
      "under this gray bluff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm dying for a drink,” cried Bo with her customary hyperbole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you'll never forget your first drink here,” remarked Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo essayed to dismount, and finally fell off, and when she did get to\n",
      "the ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function, and she\n",
      "fell flat. Dale helped her up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's wrong with me, anyhow?” she demanded, in great amaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just stiff, I reckon,” replied Dale, as he led her a few awkward steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, have you any hurts?” queried Helen, who still sat her horse, loath\n",
      "to try dismounting, yet wanting to beyond all words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo gave her an eloquent glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, did you have one in your side, like a wicked, long\n",
      "darning-needle, punching deep when you weren't ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That one I'll never get over!” exclaimed Helen, softly. Then, profiting\n",
      "by Bo's experience, she dismounted cautiously, and managed to keep\n",
      "upright. Her legs felt like wooden things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the girls went toward the spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drink slow,” called out Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Big Spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray, weathered\n",
      "bluff, from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water.\n",
      "Its fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold\n",
      "stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen and Bo lay flat on a mossy bank, seeing their faces as they bent\n",
      "over, and they sipped a mouthful, by Dale's advice, and because they\n",
      "were so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a\n",
      "precious opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The water was so cold that it sent a shock over Helen, made her teeth\n",
      "ache, and a singular, revivifying current steal all through her,\n",
      "wonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh, irresistible\n",
      "in its appeal to thirst. Helen raised her head to look at this water. It\n",
      "was colorless as she had found it tasteless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--drink!” panted Bo. “Think of our--old spring--in the\n",
      "orchard--full of pollywogs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Helen drank thirstily, with closed eyes, while a memory of home\n",
      "stirred from Bo's gift of poignant speech.\n",

      "CHAPTER VII\n",
      "\n",
      "The first camp duty Dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the\n",
      "horses, and, opening it, he took out tarpaulin and blankets, which he\n",
      "arranged on the ground under a pine-tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You girls rest,” he said, briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can't we help?” asked Helen, though she could scarcely stand.\n",

      "“You'll be welcome to do all you like after you're broke in.”\n",

      "“Broke in!” ejaculated Bo, with a little laugh. “I'm all broke UP now.”\n",

      "“Bo, it looks as if Mr. Dale expects us to have quite a stay with him in\n",
      "the woods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does,” replied Bo, as slowly she sat down upon the blankets,\n",
      "stretched out with a long sigh, and laid her head on a saddle. “Nell,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, sister, what do you intend to call him?” queried Helen,\n",
      "curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, of course,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose, then, when your Las Vegas cowboy comes along you will call\n",
      "him what he called you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo blushed, which was a rather unusual thing for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will if I like,” she retorted. “Nell, ever since I could remember\n",
      "you've raved about the West. Now you're OUT West, right in it good and\n",
      "deep. So wake up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was Bo's blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination\n",
      "of Helen's superficialities. It sank deep. Helen had no retort. Her\n",
      "ambition, as far as the West was concerned, had most assuredly not been\n",
      "for such a wild, unheard-of jaunt as this. But possibly the West--a\n",
      "living from day to day--was one succession of adventures, trials,\n",
      "tests, troubles, and achievements. To make a place for others to live\n",
      "comfortably some day! That might be Bo's meaning, embodied in her\n",
      "forceful hint. But Helen was too tired to think it out then. She found\n",
      "it interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hobbled the horses and turned them loose. Then with ax in hand he\n",
      "approached a short, dead tree, standing among a few white-barked\n",
      "aspens. Dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax. With his coat off,\n",
      "displaying his wide shoulders, straight back, and long, powerful arms,\n",
      "he looked a young giant. He was lithe and supple, brawny but not bulky.\n",
      "The ax rang on the hard wood, reverberating through the forest. A few\n",
      "strokes sufficed to bring down the stub. Then he split it up. Helen was\n",
      "curious to see how he kindled a fire. First he ripped splinters out of\n",
      "the heart of the log, and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground.\n",
      "Then from a saddlebag which hung on a near-by branch he took flint and\n",
      "steel and a piece of what Helen supposed was rag or buckskin, upon\n",
      "which powder had been rubbed. At any rate, the first strike of the steel\n",
      "brought sparks, a blaze, and burning splinters. Instantly the flame\n",
      "leaped a foot high. He put on larger pieces of wood crosswise, and the\n",
      "fire roared.\n",
      "\n",
      "That done, he stood erect, and, facing the north, he listened. Helen\n",
      "remembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before\n",
      "since the arrival at Big Spring. It was Roy for whom he was listening\n",
      "and watching. The sun had set and across the open space the tips of the\n",
      "pines were losing their brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camp utensils, which the hunter emptied out of a sack, gave forth a\n",
      "jangle of iron and tin. Next he unrolled a large pack, the contents\n",
      "of which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes. These evidently\n",
      "contained food supplies. The bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over\n",
      "it, pack and all. Dale filled it at the spring. Upon returning to the\n",
      "camp-fire he poured water into a washbasin, and, getting down to his\n",
      "knees, proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly. The act seemed a habit,\n",
      "for Helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods\n",
      "and listened. Then he dried his hands over the fire, and, turning to the\n",
      "spread-out pack, he began preparations for the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied.\n",
      "At Magdalena, on the stage-ride, and last night, she had trusted\n",
      "this stranger, a hunter of the White Mountains, who appeared ready to\n",
      "befriend her. And she had felt an exceeding gratitude. Still, she had\n",
      "looked at him impersonally. But it began to dawn upon her that chance\n",
      "had thrown her in the company of a remarkable man. That impression\n",
      "baffled her. It did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind\n",
      "to help a young woman in peril, or that he appeared deft and quick at\n",
      "camp-fire chores. Most Western men were brave, her uncle had told her,\n",
      "and many were roughly kind, and all of them could cook. This hunter was\n",
      "physically a wonderful specimen of manhood, with something leonine about\n",
      "his stature. But that did not give rise to her impression. Helen\n",
      "had been a school-teacher and used to boys, and she sensed a boyish\n",
      "simplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter. She believed, however,\n",
      "that it was a mental and spiritual force in Dale which had drawn her to\n",
      "think of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I've spoken to you three times,” protested Bo, petulantly. “What\n",
      "'re you mooning over?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm pretty tired--and far away, Bo,” replied Helen. “What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said I had an e-normous appetite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really. That's not remarkable for you. I'm too tired to eat. And afraid\n",
      "to shut my eyes. They'd never come open. When did we sleep last, Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Second night before we left home,” declared Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four nights! Oh, we've slept some.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet I make mine up in this woods. Do you suppose we'll sleep right\n",
      "here--under this tree--with no covering?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks so,” replied Helen, dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How perfectly lovely!” exclaimed Bo, in delight. “We'll see the stars\n",
      "through the pines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seems to be clouding over. Wouldn't it be awful if we had a storm?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I don't know,” answered Bo, thoughtfully. “It must storm out\n",
      "West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Helen felt a quality of inevitableness in Bo. It was something\n",
      "that had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St. Joseph.\n",
      "All of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thought--a thrilling\n",
      "consciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop in a new and wild\n",
      "environment. How strange, and fearful, perhaps, to watch that growth!\n",
      "Bo, being younger, more impressionable, with elemental rather than\n",
      "intellectual instincts, would grow stronger more swiftly. Helen wondered\n",
      "if she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive. But how could\n",
      "anyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way? It was the\n",
      "savage who did not think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen saw Dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon Roy ain't comin',” he soliloquized. “An' that's good.” Then he\n",
      "turned to the girls. “Supper's ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity. And\n",
      "they ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods. Dale\n",
      "attended them with a pleasant light upon his still face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To-morrow night we'll have meat,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wild turkey or deer. Maybe both, if you like. But it's well to take\n",
      "wild meat slow. An' turkey--that 'll melt in your mouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uummm!” murmured Bo, greedily. “I've heard of wild turkey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had finished Dale ate his meal, listening to the talk of the\n",
      "girls, and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bo's. It was\n",
      "twilight when he began to wash the pots and pans, and almost dark by the\n",
      "time his duties appeared ended. Then he replenished the campfire and\n",
      "sat down on a log to gaze into the fire. The girls leaned comfortably\n",
      "propped against the saddles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll keel over in a minute,” said Bo. “And I oughtn't--right on\n",
      "such a big supper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't see how I can sleep, and I know I can't stay awake,” rejoined\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale lifted his head alertly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls grew tense and still. Helen could not hear a sound, unless it\n",
      "was a low thud of hoof out in the gloom. The forest seemed sleeping. She\n",
      "knew from Bo's eyes, wide and shining in the camp-fire light, that she,\n",
      "too, had failed to catch whatever it was Dale meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bunch of coyotes comin',” he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy, high-strung, strange\n",
      "barks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or\n",
      "inquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at the\n",
      "edge of the circle of light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded\n",
      "the camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a\n",
      "restless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after\n",
      "the chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes\n",
      "went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence again settled down. If it had not been for the anxiety always\n",
      "present in Helen's mind she would have thought this silence sweet and\n",
      "unfamiliarly beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Listen to that fellow,” spoke up Dale. His voice was thrilling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the girls strained their ears. That was not necessary, for\n",
      "presently, clear and cold out of the silence, pealed a mournful howl,\n",
      "long drawn, strange and full and wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! What's that?” whispered Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's a big gray wolf--a timber-wolf, or lofer, as he's sometimes\n",
      "called,” replied Dale. “He's high on some rocky ridge back there. He\n",
      "scents us, an' he doesn't like it.... There he goes again. Listen! Ah,\n",
      "he's hungry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Helen listened to this exceedingly wild cry--so wild that it made\n",
      "her flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come\n",
      "over her--she kept her glance upon Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You love him?” she murmured involuntarily, quite without understanding\n",
      "the motive of her query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly Dale had never had that question asked of him before, and\n",
      "it seemed to Helen, as he pondered, that he had never even asked it of\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon so,” he replied, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But wolves kill deer, and little fawns, and everything helpless in the\n",
      "forest,” expostulated Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter nodded his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, then, can you love him?” repeated Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come to think of it, I reckon it's because of lots of reasons,”\n",
      " returned Dale. “He kills clean. He eats no carrion. He's no coward. He\n",
      "fights. He dies game.... An' he likes to be alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kills clean. What do you mean by that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A cougar, now, he mangles a deer. An' a silvertip, when killin' a\n",
      "cow or colt, he makes a mess of it. But a wolf kills clean, with sharp\n",
      "snaps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are a cougar and a silvertip?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cougar means mountain-lion or panther, an' a silvertip is a grizzly\n",
      "bear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, they're all cruel!” exclaimed Helen, shrinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon. Often I've shot wolves for relayin' a deer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer, an' while one of them\n",
      "rests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner, who'll, take\n",
      "up the chase. That way they run the deer down. Cruel it is, but nature,\n",
      "an' no worse than snow an' ice that starve deer, or a fox that kills\n",
      "turkey-chicks breakin' out of the egg, or ravens that pick the eyes out\n",
      "of new-born lambs an' wait till they die. An' for that matter, men are\n",
      "crueler than beasts of prey, for men add to nature, an' have more than\n",
      "instincts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was silenced, as well as shocked. She had not only learned a new\n",
      "and striking viewpoint in natural history, but a clear intimation to the\n",
      "reason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in\n",
      "this man. A hunter was one who killed animals for their fur, for their\n",
      "meat or horns, or for some lust for blood--that was Helen's definition\n",
      "of a hunter, and she believed it was held by the majority of people\n",
      "living in settled states. But the majority might be wrong. A hunter\n",
      "might be vastly different, and vastly more than a tracker and slayer\n",
      "of game. The mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men.\n",
      "Perhaps Dale knew its secrets, its life, its terror, its beauty, its\n",
      "sadness, and its joy; and if so, how full, how wonderful must be his\n",
      "mind! He spoke of men as no better than wolves. Could a lonely life\n",
      "in the wilderness teach a man that? Bitterness, envy, jealousy, spite,\n",
      "greed, and hate--these had no place in this hunter's heart. It was not\n",
      "Helen's shrewdness, but a woman's intuition, which divined that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale rose to his feet and, turning his ear to the north, listened once\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you expecting Roy still?” inquired Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it ain't likely he'll turn up to-night,” replied Dale, and then he\n",
      "strode over to put a hand on the pine-tree that soared above where the\n",
      "girls lay. His action, and the way he looked up at the tree-top and then\n",
      "at adjacent trees, held more of that significance which so interested\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon he's stood there some five hundred years an' will stand\n",
      "through to-night,” muttered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pine was the monarch of that wide-spread group.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen again,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was asleep. And Helen, listening, at once caught low, distant roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wind. It's goin' to storm,” explained Dale. “You'll hear somethin'\n",
      "worth while. But don't be scared. Reckon we'll be safe. Pines blow down\n",
      "often. But this fellow will stand any fall wind that ever was.... Better\n",
      "slip under the blankets so I can pull the tarp up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen slid down, just as she was, fully dressed except for boots, which\n",
      "she and Bo had removed; and she laid her head close to Bo's. Dale pulled\n",
      "the tarpaulin up and folded it back just below their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When it rains you'll wake, an' then just pull the tarp up over you,” he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will it rain?” Helen asked. But she was thinking that this moment\n",
      "was the strangest that had ever happened to her. By the light of the\n",
      "camp-fire she saw Dale's face, just as usual, still, darkly serene,\n",
      "expressing no thought. He was kind, but he was not thinking of these\n",
      "sisters as girls, alone with him in a pitch-black forest, helpless and\n",
      "defenseless. He did not seem to be thinking at all. But Helen had never\n",
      "before in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be close by an' keep the fire goin' all night,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard him stride off into the darkness. Presently there came a\n",
      "dragging, bumping sound, then a crash of a log dropped upon the fire.\n",
      "A cloud of sparks shot up, and many pattered down to hiss upon the damp\n",
      "ground. Smoke again curled upward along the great, seamed tree-trunk,\n",
      "and flames sputtered and crackled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen listened again for the roar of wind. It seemed to come on a breath\n",
      "of air that fanned her cheek and softly blew Bo's curls, and it was\n",
      "stronger. But it died out presently, only to come again, and still\n",
      "stronger. Helen realized then that the sound was that of an approaching\n",
      "storm. Her heavy eyelids almost refused to stay open, and she knew if\n",
      "she let them close she would instantly drop to sleep. And she wanted to\n",
      "hear the storm-wind in the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few drops of cold rain fell upon her face, thrilling her with the\n",
      "proof that no roof stood between her and the elements. Then a breeze\n",
      "bore the smell of burnt wood into her face, and somehow her quick mind\n",
      "flew to girlhood days when she burned brush and leaves with her little\n",
      "brothers. The memory faded. The roar that had seemed distant was now\n",
      "back in the forest, coming swiftly, increasing in volume. Like a\n",
      "stream in flood it bore down. Helen grew amazed, startled. How rushing,\n",
      "oncoming, and heavy this storm-wind! She likened its approach to the\n",
      "tread of an army. Then the roar filled the forest, yet it was back there\n",
      "behind her. Not a pine-needle quivered in the light of the camp-fire.\n",
      "But the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge. The roar\n",
      "augmented till it was no longer a roar, but an on-sweeping crash, like\n",
      "an ocean torrent engulfing the earth. Bo awoke to cling to Helen\n",
      "with fright. The deafening storm-blast was upon them. Helen felt the\n",
      "saddle-pillow move under her head. The giant pine had trembled to its\n",
      "very roots. That mighty fury of wind was all aloft, in the tree-tops.\n",
      "And for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power.\n",
      "Then the deafening crash passed to roar, and that swept on and on,\n",
      "lessening in volume, deepening in low detonation, at last to die in the\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and\n",
      "ceased and rose again. Helen lay there, whispering to Bo, and heard\n",
      "again the great wave of wind come and crash and cease. That was the way\n",
      "of this storm-wind of the mountain forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned Helen to remember Dale's\n",
      "directions, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike\n",
      "over the saddle. Then, with Bo close and warm beside her, she closed\n",
      "her eyes, and the sense of the black forest and the wind and rain\n",
      "faded. Last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the\n",
      "tarpaulin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When she opened her eyes she remembered everything, as if only a moment\n",
      "had elapsed. But it was daylight, though gray and cloudy. The pines were\n",
      "dripping mist. A fire crackled cheerily and blue smoke curled upward and\n",
      "a savory odor of hot coffee hung in the air. Horses were standing\n",
      "near by, biting and kicking at one another. Bo was sound asleep. Dale\n",
      "appeared busy around the camp-fire. As Helen watched the hunter she\n",
      "saw him pause in his task, turn his ear to listen, and then look\n",
      "expectantly. And at that juncture a shout pealed from the forest.\n",
      "Helen recognized Roy's voice. Then she heard a splashing of water, and\n",
      "hoof-beats coming closer. With that the buckskin mustang trotted into\n",
      "camp, carrying Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad mornin' for ducks, but good for us,” he called.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Roy!” greeted Dale, and his gladness was unmistakable. “I was\n",
      "lookin' for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy appeared to slide off the mustang without effort, and his swift\n",
      "hands slapped the straps as he unsaddled. Buckskin was wet with sweat\n",
      "and foam mixed with rain. He heaved. And steam rose from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must have rode hard,” observed Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shore did,” replied Roy. Then he espied Helen, who had sat up, with\n",
      "hands to her hair, and eyes staring at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mornin', miss. It's good news.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank Heaven!” murmured Helen, and then she shook Bo. That young lady\n",
      "awoke, but was loath to give up slumber. “Bo! Bo! Wake up! Mr. Roy is\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Bo sat up, disheveled and sleepy-eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh-h, but I ache!” she moaned. But her eyes took in the camp scene to\n",
      "the effect that she added, “Is breakfast ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Almost. An' flapjacks this mornin',” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo manifested active symptoms of health in the manner with which she\n",
      "laced her boots. Helen got their traveling-bag, and with this they\n",
      "repaired to a flat stone beside the spring, not, however, out of earshot\n",
      "of the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long are you goin' to hang around camp before tellin' me?” inquired\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jest as I figgered, Milt,” replied Roy. “Thet rider who passed you was\n",
      "a messenger to Anson. He an' his gang got on our trail quick. About ten\n",
      "o'clock I seen them comin'. Then I lit out for the woods. I stayed off\n",
      "in the woods close enough to see where they come in. An' shore they\n",
      "lost your trail. Then they spread through the woods, workin' off to the\n",
      "south, thinkin', of course, thet you would circle round to Pine on the\n",
      "south side of Old Baldy. There ain't a hoss-tracker in Snake Anson's\n",
      "gang, thet's shore. Wal, I follered them for an hour till they'd rustled\n",
      "some miles off our trail. Then I went back to where you struck into\n",
      "the woods. An' I waited there all afternoon till dark, expectin' mebbe\n",
      "they'd back-trail. But they didn't. I rode on a ways an' camped in the\n",
      "woods till jest before daylight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So far so good,” declared Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. There's rough country south of Baldy an' along the two or three\n",
      "trails Anson an' his outfit will camp, you bet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't to be thought of,” muttered Dale, at some idea that had struck\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What ain't?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Goin' round the north side of Baldy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It shore ain't,” rejoined Roy, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I've got to hide tracks certain--rustle to my camp an' stay there\n",
      "till you say it's safe to risk takin' the girls to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, you're talkin' the wisdom of the prophets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ain't so sure we can hide tracks altogether. If Anson had any eyes\n",
      "for the woods he'd not have lost me so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But, you see, he's figgerin' to cross your trail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an' hide tracks\n",
      "certain, I'd feel safe from pursuit, anyway,” said the hunter,\n",
      "reflectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore an' easy,” responded Roy, quickly. “I jest met up with some\n",
      "greaser sheep-herders drivin' a big flock. They've come up from the\n",
      "south an' are goin' to fatten up at Turkey Senacas. Then they'll drive\n",
      "back south an' go on to Phenix. Wal, it's muddy weather. Now you break\n",
      "camp quick an' make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail, as if you\n",
      "was travelin' south. But, instead, you ride round ahead of thet flock of\n",
      "sheep. They'll keep to the open parks an' the trails through them necks\n",
      "of woods out here. An', passin' over your tracks, they'll hide 'em.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But supposin' Anson circles an' hits this camp? He'll track me easy out\n",
      "to that sheep trail. What then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jest what you want. Goin' south thet sheep trail is downhill an' muddy.\n",
      "It's goin' to rain hard. Your tracks would get washed out even if you\n",
      "did go south. An' Anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the\n",
      "scent. Leave it to me, Milt. You're a hunter. But I'm a hoss-tracker.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right. We'll rustle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he called the girls to hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII\n",
      "\n",
      "Once astride the horse again, Helen had to congratulate herself upon not\n",
      "being so crippled as she had imagined. Indeed, Bo made all the audible\n",
      "complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both girls had long water-proof coats, brand-new, and of which they were\n",
      "considerably proud. New clothes had not been a common event in their\n",
      "lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I'll have to slit these,” Dale had said, whipping out a huge\n",
      "knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” had been Bo's feeble protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They wasn't made for ridin'. An' you'll get wet enough even if I do cut\n",
      "them. An' if I don't, you'll get soaked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go ahead,” had been Helen's reluctant permission.\n",
      "\n",
      "So their long new coats were slit half-way up the back. The exigency of\n",
      "the case was manifest to Helen, when she saw how they came down over the\n",
      "cantles of the saddles and to their boot-tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning was gray and cold. A fine, misty rain fell and the trees\n",
      "dripped steadily. Helen was surprised to see the open country again and\n",
      "that apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while. The\n",
      "country was wide and flat on the right, and to the left it rolled and\n",
      "heaved along a black, scalloped timber-line. Above this bordering of\n",
      "the forest low, drifting clouds obscured the mountains. The wind was at\n",
      "Helen's back and seemed to be growing stronger. Dale and Roy were ahead,\n",
      "traveling at a good trot, with the pack-animals bunched before them.\n",
      "Helen and Bo had enough to do to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first hour's ride brought little change in weather or scenery, but\n",
      "it gave Helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up\n",
      "all day. She began to welcome the places where the horses walked, but\n",
      "she disliked the levels. As for the descents, she hated those. Ranger\n",
      "would not go down slowly and the shake-up she received was unpleasant.\n",
      "Moreover, the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and\n",
      "washes. He sailed over them like a bird. Helen could not acquire the\n",
      "knack of sitting the saddle properly, and so, not only was her person\n",
      "bruised on these occasions, but her feelings were hurt. Helen had\n",
      "never before been conscious of vanity. Still, she had never rejoiced\n",
      "in looking at a disadvantage, and her exhibitions here must have been\n",
      "frightful. Bo always would forge to the front, and she seldom looked\n",
      "back, for which Helen was grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before long they struck into a broad, muddy belt, full of innumerable\n",
      "small hoof tracks. This, then, was the sheep trail Roy had advised\n",
      "following. They rode on it for three or four miles, and at length,\n",
      "coming to a gray-green valley, they saw a huge flock of sheep. Soon the\n",
      "air was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep, and a\n",
      "low, soft roar of pattering hoofs. The flock held a compact formation,\n",
      "covering several acres, and grazed along rapidly. There were three\n",
      "herders on horses and several pack-burros. Dale engaged one of the\n",
      "Mexicans in conversation, and passed something to him, then pointed\n",
      "northward and down along the trail. The Mexican grinned from ear to ear,\n",
      "and Helen caught the quick “SI, SENOR! GRACIAS, SENOR!” It was a pretty\n",
      "sight, that flock of sheep, as it rolled along like a rounded woolly\n",
      "stream of grays and browns and here and there a black. They were keeping\n",
      "to a trail over the flats. Dale headed into this trail and, if anything,\n",
      "trotted a little faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the clouds lifted and broke, showing blue sky and one streak\n",
      "of sunshine. But the augury was without warrant. The wind increased. A\n",
      "huge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that\n",
      "could be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a\n",
      "swiftly moving wall. Soon it enveloped the fugitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "With head bowed, Helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold, gray\n",
      "rain that blew almost on a level. Finally the heavy downpour passed,\n",
      "leaving a fine mist. The clouds scurried low and dark, hiding the\n",
      "mountains altogether and making the gray, wet plain a dreary sight.\n",
      "Helen's feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water. And\n",
      "they were cold. Her gloves, too, had not been intended for rain, and\n",
      "they were wet through. The cold bit at her fingers so that she had to\n",
      "beat her hands together. Ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was\n",
      "to trot faster, which event was worse for Helen than freezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw another black, scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its\n",
      "trailing sheets of rain, and this one appeared streaked with white.\n",
      "Snow! The wind was now piercingly cold. Helen's body kept warm, but\n",
      "her extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly. She gazed ahead\n",
      "grimly. There was no help; she had to go on. Dale and Roy were hunched\n",
      "down in their saddles, probably wet through, for they wore no rain-proof\n",
      "coats. Bo kept close behind them, and plain it was that she felt the\n",
      "cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second storm was not so bad as the first, because there was less\n",
      "rain. Still, the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow. It lasted\n",
      "for an hour, during which the horses trotted on, trotted on. Again the\n",
      "gray torrent roared away, the fine mist blew, the clouds lifted and\n",
      "separated, and, closing again, darkened for another onslaught. This one\n",
      "brought sleet. The driving pellets stung Helen's neck and cheeks, and\n",
      "for a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was\n",
      "afraid she could not hold up under them. The bare places on the ground\n",
      "showed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, storm after storm rolled over Helen's head. Her feet grew numb\n",
      "and ceased to hurt. But her fingers, because of her ceaseless efforts\n",
      "to keep up the circulation, retained the stinging pain. And now the wind\n",
      "pierced right through her. She marveled at her endurance, and there were\n",
      "many times that she believed she could not ride farther. Yet she kept\n",
      "on. All the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as\n",
      "this. Hard and cold, wet and windy, at an increasing elevation--that was\n",
      "the explanation. The air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, during all those interminable hours, Helen watched where she was\n",
      "traveling, and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize\n",
      "it. The afternoon appeared far advanced when Dale and Roy led down into\n",
      "an immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats. They rode\n",
      "along its margin, splashing up to the knees of the horses. Cranes and\n",
      "herons flew on with lumbering motion; flocks of ducks winged swift\n",
      "flight from one side to the other. Beyond this depression the land\n",
      "sloped rather abruptly; outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of\n",
      "the highest ground, and again a dark fringe of trees appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many miles! wondered Helen. They seemed as many and as long as\n",
      "the hours. But at last, just as another hard rain came, the pines\n",
      "were reached. They proved to be widely scattered and afforded little\n",
      "protection from the storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen sat her saddle, a dead weight. Whenever Ranger quickened his gait\n",
      "or crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling\n",
      "off. Her mind harbored only sensations of misery, and a persistent\n",
      "thought--why did she ever leave home for the West? Her solicitude for Bo\n",
      "had been forgotten. Nevertheless, any marked change in the topography\n",
      "of the country was registered, perhaps photographed on her memory by the\n",
      "torturing vividness of her experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forest grew more level and denser. Shadows of twilight or gloom lay\n",
      "under the trees. Presently Dale and Roy, disappeared, going downhill,\n",
      "and likewise Bo. Then Helen's ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid\n",
      "water. Ranger trotted faster. Soon Helen came to the edge of a great\n",
      "valley, black and gray, so full of obscurity that she could not see\n",
      "across or down into it. But she knew there was a rushing river at\n",
      "the bottom. The sound was deep, continuous, a heavy, murmuring roar,\n",
      "singularly musical. The trail was steep. Helen had not lost all feeling,\n",
      "as she had believed and hoped. Her poor, mistreated body still responded\n",
      "excruciatingly to concussions, jars, wrenches, and all the other\n",
      "horrible movements making up a horse-trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "For long Helen did not look up. When she did so there lay a green,\n",
      "willow-bordered, treeless space at the bottom of the valley, through\n",
      "which a brown-white stream rushed with steady, ear-filling roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale and Roy drove the pack-animals across the stream, and followed,\n",
      "going deep to the flanks of their horses. Bo rode into the foaming water\n",
      "as if she had been used to it all her days. A slip, a fall, would have\n",
      "meant that Bo must drown in that mountain torrent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger trotted straight to the edge, and there, obedient to Helen's\n",
      "clutch on the bridle, he halted. The stream was fifty feet wide, shallow\n",
      "on the near side, deep on the opposite, with fast current and big waves.\n",
      "Helen was simply too frightened to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him come!” yelled Dale. “Stick on now!... Ranger!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The big black plunged in, making the water fly. That stream was nothing\n",
      "for him, though it seemed impassable to Helen. She had not the strength\n",
      "left to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them. Ranger, in two\n",
      "more plunges, surmounted the bank, and then, trotting across the green\n",
      "to where the other horses stood steaming under some pines, he gave a\n",
      "great heave and halted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy reached up to help her off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty miles, Miss Helen,” he said, and the way he spoke was a\n",
      "compliment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had to lift her off and help her to the tree where Bo leaned. Dale\n",
      "had ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddle-blankets on the ground\n",
      "under the pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--you swore--you loved me!” was Bo's mournful greeting. The girl\n",
      "was pale, drawn, blue-lipped, and she could not stand up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I never did--or I'd never have brought you to this--wretch that I\n",
      "am!” cried Helen. “Oh, what a horrible ride!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rain was falling, the trees were dripping, the sky was lowering. All the\n",
      "ground was soaking wet, with pools and puddles everywhere. Helen could\n",
      "imagine nothing but a heartless, dreary, cold prospect. Just then home\n",
      "was vivid and poignant in her thoughts. Indeed, so utterly miserable\n",
      "was she that the exquisite relief of sitting down, of a cessation of\n",
      "movement, of a release from that infernal perpetual-trotting horse,\n",
      "seemed only a mockery. It could not be true that the time had come for\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheep-herders,\n",
      "for there were remains of a fire. Dale lifted the burnt end of a log\n",
      "and brought it down hard upon the ground, splitting off pieces. Several\n",
      "times he did this. It was amazing to see his strength, his facility, as\n",
      "he split off handfuls of splinters. He collected a bundle of them, and,\n",
      "laying them down, he bent over them. Roy wielded the ax on another log,\n",
      "and each stroke split off a long strip. Then a tiny column of smoke\n",
      "drifted up over Dale's shoulder as he leaned, bareheaded, sheltering the\n",
      "splinters with his hat. A blaze leaped up. Roy came with an armful of\n",
      "strips all white and dry, out of the inside of a log. Crosswise these\n",
      "were laid over the blaze, and it began to roar. Then piece by piece the\n",
      "men built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods, branches\n",
      "and stumps and logs, erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke\n",
      "roared upward. It had not taken two minutes. Already Helen felt the\n",
      "warmth on her icy face. She held up her bare, numb hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Dale and Roy were wet through to the skin, yet they did not tarry\n",
      "beside the fire. They relieved the horses. A lasso went up between two\n",
      "pines, and a tarpaulin over it, V-shaped and pegged down at the four\n",
      "ends. The packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and\n",
      "bedding were placed under this shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen thought this might have taken five minutes more. In this short\n",
      "space of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot.\n",
      "Rain was falling steadily all around, but over and near that roaring\n",
      "blaze, ten feet high, no water fell. It evaporated. The ground began to\n",
      "steam and to dry. Helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out\n",
      "the cold. But presently the pain ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I never knew before how good a fire could feel,” declared Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therein lay more food for Helen's reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ten minutes Helen was dry and hot. Darkness came down upon the\n",
      "dreary, sodden forest, but that great camp-fire made it a different\n",
      "world from the one Helen had anticipated. It blazed and roared, cracked\n",
      "like a pistol, hissed and sputtered, shot sparks everywhere, and sent\n",
      "aloft a dense, yellow, whirling column of smoke. It began to have a\n",
      "heart of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the\n",
      "coffee-pot and oven soon began to steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, I promised the girls turkey to-night,” said the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe to-morrow, if the wind shifts. This 's turkey country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, a potato will do me!” exclaimed Bo. “Never again will I ask for\n",
      "cake and pie! I never appreciated good things to eat. And I've been a\n",
      "little pig, always. I never--never knew what it was to be hungry--until\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale glanced up quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lass, it's worth learnin',” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's thought was too deep for words. In such brief space had she been\n",
      "transformed from misery to comfort!\n",
      "\n",
      "The rain kept on falling, though it appeared to grow softer as night\n",
      "settled down black. The wind died away and the forest was still, except\n",
      "for the steady roar of the stream. A folded tarpaulin was laid between\n",
      "the pine and the fire, well in the light and warmth, and upon it the\n",
      "men set steaming pots and plates and cups, the fragrance from which was\n",
      "strong and inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fetch the saddle-blanket an' set with your backs to the fire,” said\n",
      "Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and\n",
      "sheltered from the rain, Helen remained awake after Bo had fallen\n",
      "asleep. The big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day. She\n",
      "could see the smoke, the trunk of the big pine towering aloft, and\n",
      "a blank space of sky. The stream hummed a song, seemingly musical at\n",
      "times, and then discordant and dull, now low, now roaring, and always\n",
      "rushing, gurgling, babbling, flowing, chafing in its hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses,\n",
      "and beside the fire they conversed in low tones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet trail we made to-day will be hid, I reckon,” said Roy, with\n",
      "satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What wasn't sheeped over would be washed out. We've had luck. An' now I\n",
      "ain't worryin',” returned Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Worryin'? Then it's the first I ever knowed you to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man, I never had a job like this,” protested the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet's so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Roy, when old Al Auchincloss finds out about this deal, as he's\n",
      "bound to when you or the boys get back to Pine, he's goin' to roar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you reckon folks will side with him against Beasley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some of them. But Al, like as not, will tell folks to go where it's\n",
      "hot. He'll bunch his men an' strike for the mountains to find his\n",
      "nieces.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, all you've got to do is to keep the girls hid till I can guide him\n",
      "up to your camp. Or, failin' thet, till you can slip the girls down to\n",
      "Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one but you an' your brothers ever seen my senaca. But it could be\n",
      "found easy enough.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Why ain't it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I'll stick to thet sheep-thief's tracks like a wolf after a\n",

      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” declared Dale. “I was calculatin' you'd go down to Pine, sooner\n",
      "or later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not unless Anson goes. I told John thet in case there was no fight on\n",
      "the stage to make a bee-line back to Pine. He was to tell Al an' offer\n",
      "his services along with Joe an' Hal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One way or another, then, there's bound to be blood spilled over this.”\n",

      "“In that case I hope you hold straighter than times I've seen you.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“You're no good on movin' targets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, mebbe so. But I'm not lookin' for a movin' target when I meet up\n",
      "with Beasley. I'm a hossman, not a hunter. You're used to shootin' flies\n",
      "off deer's horns, jest for practice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, can we make my camp by to-morrow night?” queried Dale, more\n",
      "seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will, if each of us has to carry one of the girls. But they'll do it\n",
      "or die. Dale, did you ever see a gamer girl than thet kid Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me! Where'd I ever see any girls?” ejaculated Dale. “I remember some\n",
      "when I was a boy, but I was only fourteen then. Never had much use for\n",
      "girls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd like to have a wife like that Bo,” declared Roy, fervidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There ensued a moment's silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, you're a Mormon an' you already got a wife,” was Dale's reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Milt, have you lived so long in the woods thet you never heard of\n",
      "a Mormon with two wives?” returned Roy, and then he laughed heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never could stomach what I did hear pertainin' to more than one wife\n",
      "for a man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, my friend, you go an' get yourself ONE. An' see then if you\n",
      "wouldn't like to have TWO.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon one 'd be more than enough for Milt Dale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, old man, let me tell you thet I always envied you your freedom,”\n",
      " said Roy, earnestly. “But it ain't life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean life is love of a woman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Thet's only part. I mean a son--a boy thet's like you--thet you\n",
      "feel will go on with your life after you're gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've thought of that--thought it all out, watchin' the birds an'\n",
      "animals mate in the woods.... If I have no son I'll never live\n",
      "hereafter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal,” replied Roy, hesitatingly, “I don't go in so deep as thet. I mean\n",
      "a son goes on with your blood an' your work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly... An', Roy, I envy you what you've got, because it's out of\n",
      "all bounds for Milt Dale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Those words, sad and deep, ended the conversation. Again the rumbling,\n",
      "rushing stream dominated the forest. An owl hooted dismally. A horse\n",
      "trod thuddingly near by and from that direction came a cutting tear of\n",
      "teeth on grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A voice pierced Helen's deep dreams and, awaking, she found Bo shaking\n",
      "and calling her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you dead?” came the gay voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Almost. Oh, my back's broken,” replied Helen. The desire to move seemed\n",
      "clamped in a vise, and even if that came she believed the effort would\n",
      "be impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy called us,” said Bo. “He said hurry. I thought I'd die just sitting\n",
      "up, and I'd give you a million dollars to lace my boots. Wait, sister,\n",
      "till you try to pull on one of those stiff boots!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With heroic and violent spirit Helen sat up to find that in the act\n",
      "her aches and pains appeared beyond number. Reaching for her boots,\n",
      "she found them cold and stiff. Helen unlaced one and, opening it wide,\n",
      "essayed to get her sore foot down into it. But her foot appeared swollen\n",
      "and the boot appeared shrunken. She could not get it half on, though\n",
      "she expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms. She\n",
      "groaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo laughed wickedly. Her hair was tousled, her eyes dancing, her cheeks\n",
      "red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be game!” she said. “Stand up like a real Western girl and PULL your\n",
      "boot on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Bo's scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to\n",
      "Helen, but the fact was that she got into her boots. Walking and\n",
      "moving a little appeared to loosen the stiff joints and ease that tired\n",
      "feeling. The water of the stream where the girls washed was colder than\n",
      "any ice Helen had ever felt. It almost paralyzed her hands. Bo mumbled,\n",
      "and blew like a porpoise. They had to run to the fire before being able\n",
      "to comb their hair. The air was wonderfully keen. The dawn was clear,\n",
      "bright, with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All ready, girls,” called Roy. “Reckon you can help yourselves. Milt\n",
      "ain't comin' in very fast with the hosses. I'll rustle off to help him.\n",
      "We've got a hard day before us. Yesterday wasn't nowhere to what to-day\n",
      "'ll be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the sun's going to shine?” implored Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you bet,” rejoined Roy, as he strode off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen and Bo ate breakfast and had the camp to themselves for perhaps\n",
      "half an hour; then the horses came thudding down, with Dale and Roy\n",
      "riding bareback.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time all was in readiness to start the sun was up, melting the\n",
      "frost and ice, so that a dazzling, bright mist, full of rainbows, shone\n",
      "under the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale looked Ranger over, and tried the cinches of Bo's horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's your choice--a long ride behind the packs with me--or a short\n",
      "cut over the hills with Roy?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I choose the lesser of two rides,” replied Helen, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon that 'll be easier, but you'll know you've had a ride,” said\n",
      "Dale, significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that we had yesterday?” asked Bo, archly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only thirty miles, but cold an' wet. To-day will be fine for ridin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I'll take a blanket an' some grub in case you don't meet us\n",
      "to-night,” said Roy. “An' I reckon we'll split up here where I'll have\n",
      "to strike out on thet short cut.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo mounted without a helping hand, but Helen's limbs were so stiff that\n",
      "she could not get astride the high Ranger without assistance. The hunter\n",
      "headed up the slope of the canyon, which on that side was not steep.\n",
      "It was brown pine forest, with here and there a clump of dark,\n",
      "silver-pointed evergreens that Roy called spruce. By the time this slope\n",
      "was surmounted Helen's aches were not so bad. The saddle appeared to\n",
      "fit her better, and the gait of the horse was not so unfamiliar. She\n",
      "reflected, however, that she always had done pretty well uphill. Here it\n",
      "was beautiful forest-land, uneven and wilder. They rode for a time along\n",
      "the rim, with the white rushing stream in plain sight far below, with\n",
      "its melodious roar ever thrumming in the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale reined in and peered down at the pine-mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fresh deer sign all along here,” he said, pointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I seen thet long ago,” rejoined Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's scrutiny was rewarded by descrying several tiny depressions in\n",
      "the pine-needles, dark in color and sharply defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We may never get a better chance,” said Dale. “Those deer are workin'\n",
      "up our way. Get your rifle out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel was resumed then, with Roy a little in advance of the pack-train.\n",
      "Presently he dismounted, threw his bridle, and cautiously peered ahead.\n",
      "Then, turning, he waved his sombrero. The pack-animals halted in a\n",
      "bunch. Dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode up to Roy's horse.\n",
      "This point, Helen saw, was at the top of an intersecting canuon. Dale\n",
      "dismounted, without drawing his rifle from its saddle-sheath, and\n",
      "approached Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Buck an' two does,” he said, low-voiced. “An' they've winded us, but\n",
      "don't see us yet.... Girls, ride up closer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the directions indicated by Dale's long arm, Helen looked down\n",
      "the slope. It was open, with tall pines here and there, and clumps of\n",
      "silver spruce, and aspens shining like gold in the morning sunlight.\n",
      "Presently Bo exclaimed: “Oh, look! I see! I see!” Then Helen's roving\n",
      "glance passed something different from green and gold and brown.\n",
      "Shifting back to it she saw a magnificent stag, with noble spreading\n",
      "antlers, standing like a statue, his head up in alert and wild posture.\n",
      "His color was gray. Beside him grazed two deer of slighter and more\n",
      "graceful build, without horns.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's downhill,” whispered Dale. “An' you're goin' to overshoot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen saw that Roy had his rifle leveled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don't!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's remark evidently nettled Roy. He lowered the rifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, it's me lookin' over this gun. How can you stand there an' tell\n",
      "me I'm goin' to shoot high? I had a dead bead on him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, you didn't allow for downhill... Hurry. He sees us now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy leveled the rifle and, taking aim as before, he fired. The buck\n",
      "stood perfectly motionless, as if he had indeed been stone. The does,\n",
      "however, jumped with a start, and gazed in fright in every direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Told you! I seen where your bullet hit thet pine--half a foot over his\n",
      "shoulder. Try again an' aim at his legs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy now took a quicker aim and pulled trigger. A puff of dust right at\n",
      "the feet of the buck showed where Roy's lead had struck this time. With\n",
      "a single bound, wonderful to see, the big deer was out of sight behind\n",
      "trees and brush. The does leaped after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doggone the luck!” ejaculated Roy, red in the face, as he worked the\n",
      "lever of his rifle. “Never could shoot downhill, nohow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "His rueful apology to the girls for missing brought a merry laugh from\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for worlds would I have had you kill that beautiful deer!” she\n",
      "exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We won't have venison steak off him, that's certain,” remarked Dale,\n",
      "dryly. “An' maybe none off any deer, if Roy does the shootin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They resumed travel, sheering off to the right and keeping to the edge\n",
      "of the intersecting canuon. At length they rode down to the bottom,\n",
      "where a tiny brook babbled through willows, and they followed this for\n",
      "a mile or so down to where it flowed into the larger stream. A dim trail\n",
      "overgrown with grass showed at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's where we part,” said Dale. “You'll beat me into my camp, but\n",
      "I'll get there sometime after dark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey, Milt, I forgot about thet darned pet cougar of yours an' the rest\n",
      "of your menagerie. Reckon they won't scare the girls? Especially old\n",
      "Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't see Tom till I get home,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain't he corralled or tied up?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. He has the run of the place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, good-by, then, an' rustle along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale nodded to the girls, and, turning his horse, he drove the\n",
      "pack-train before him up the open space between the stream and the\n",
      "wooded slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy stepped off his horse with that single action which appeared such a\n",
      "feat to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guess I'd better cinch up,” he said, as he threw a stirrup up over the\n",
      "pommel of his saddle. “You girls are goin' to see wild country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's old Tom?” queried Bo, curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, he's Milt's pet cougar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cougar? That's a panther--a mountain-lion, didn't he say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore is. Tom is a beauty. An' if he takes a likin' to you he'll love\n",
      "you, play with you, maul you half to death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was all eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale has other pets, too?” she questioned, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never was up to his camp but what it was overrun with birds an'\n",
      "squirrels an' vermin of all kinds, as tame as tame as cows. Too darn\n",
      "tame, Milt says. But I can't figger thet. You girls will never want to\n",
      "leave thet senaca of his.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's a senaca?” asked Helen, as she shifted her foot to let him\n",
      "tighten the cinches on her saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's Mexican for park, I guess,” he replied. “These mountains are\n",
      "full of parks; an', say, I don't ever want to see no prettier place till\n",
      "I get to heaven.... There, Ranger, old boy, thet's tight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He slapped the horse affectionately, and, turning to his own, he stepped\n",
      "and swung his long length up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't deep crossin' here. Come on,” he called, and spurred his bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stream here was wide and it looked deep, but turned out to be\n",
      "deceptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, girls, here beginneth the second lesson,” he drawled, cheerily.\n",
      "“Ride one behind the other--stick close to me--do what I do--an' holler\n",
      "when you want to rest or if somethin' goes bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he spurred into the thicket. Bo went next and Helen followed.\n",
      "The willows dragged at her so hard that she was unable to watch Roy, and\n",
      "the result was that a low-sweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard\n",
      "on the head. It hurt and startled her, and roused her mettle. Roy was\n",
      "keeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well, and he led up\n",
      "a slope to the open pine forest. Here the ride for several miles was\n",
      "straight, level, and open. Helen liked the forest to-day. It was brown\n",
      "and green, with patches of gold where the sun struck. She saw her first\n",
      "bird--big blue grouse that whirred up from under her horse, and little\n",
      "checkered gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing. Several times\n",
      "Roy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle, and often\n",
      "when he pointed Helen was not quick enough to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of\n",
      "yesterday. So far she had been only barely conscious of sore places\n",
      "and aching bones. These she would bear with. She loved the wild and the\n",
      "beautiful, both of which increased manifestly with every mile. The sun\n",
      "was warm, the air fragrant and cool, the sky blue as azure and so deep\n",
      "that she imagined that she could look far up into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look!” he called, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not thet way! Here! Aw, he's gone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! It was a bear! I saw it! Oh! not like circus bears at all!” cried\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had missed her opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon he was a grizzly, an' I'm jest as well pleased thet he loped\n",
      "off,” said Roy. Altering his course somewhat, he led to an old rotten\n",
      "log that the bear had been digging in. “After grubs. There, see his\n",
      "track. He was a whopper shore enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode on, out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range,\n",
      "gorge and ridge, green and black as far as Helen could see. The ranges\n",
      "were bold and long, climbing to the central uplift, where a number of\n",
      "fringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of Old Baldy.\n",
      "Far as vision could see, to the right lay one rolling forest of pine,\n",
      "beautiful and serene. Somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert,\n",
      "but it was not in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see turkeys 'way down there,” said Roy, backing away. “We'll go down\n",
      "and around an' mebbe I'll get a shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Descent beyond a rocky point was made through thick brush. This slope\n",
      "consisted of wide benches covered with copses and scattered pines and\n",
      "many oaks. Helen was delighted to see the familiar trees, although these\n",
      "were different from Missouri oaks. Rugged and gnarled, but not tall,\n",
      "these trees spread wide branches, the leaves of which were yellowing.\n",
      "Roy led into a grassy glade, and, leaping off his horse, rifle in hand,\n",
      "he prepared to shoot at something. Again Bo cried out, but this time it\n",
      "was in delight. Then Helen saw an immense flock of turkeys, apparently\n",
      "like the turkeys she knew at home, but these had bronze and checks\n",
      "of white, and they looked wild. There must have been a hundred in the\n",
      "flock, most of them hens. A few gobblers on the far side began the\n",
      "flight, running swiftly off. Helen plainly heard the thud of their\n",
      "feet. Roy shot once--twice--three times. Then rose a great commotion and\n",
      "thumping, and a loud roar of many wings. Dust and leaves whirling in the\n",
      "air were left where the turkeys had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I got two,” said Roy, and he strode forward to pick up his game.\n",
      "Returning, he tied two shiny, plump gobblers back of his saddle and\n",
      "remounted his horse. “We'll have turkey to-night, if Milt gets to camp\n",
      "in time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ride was resumed. Helen never would have tired riding through those\n",
      "oak groves, brown and sear and yellow, with leaves and acorns falling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bears have been workin' in here already,” said Roy. “I see tracks all\n",
      "over. They eat acorns in the fall. An' mebbe we'll run into one yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees, so that\n",
      "dodging branches was no light task. Ranger did not seem to care how\n",
      "close he passed a tree or under a limb, so that he missed them himself;\n",
      "but Helen thereby got some additional bruises. Particularly hard was it,\n",
      "when passing a tree, to get her knee out of the way in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation\n",
      "and in places covered with a thick scum. But it had a current and an\n",
      "outlet, proving it to be a huge, spring. Roy pointed down at a muddy\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bear-wallow. He heard us comin'. Look at thet little track. Cub track.\n",
      "An' look at these scratches on this tree, higher 'n my head. An old\n",
      "she-bear stood up, an' scratched them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Woods's full of big bears,” he said, grinning. “An' I take it\n",
      "particular kind of this old she rustlin' off with her cub. She-bears\n",
      "with cubs are dangerous.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The next place to stir Helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom\n",
      "of this canuon. Beech-trees, maples, aspens, overtopped by lofty\n",
      "pines, made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown,\n",
      "swirling current, and leaves drifted down, and stray flecks of golden\n",
      "sunlight lightened the gloom. Here was hard riding to and fro across the\n",
      "brook, between huge mossy boulders, and between aspens so close together\n",
      "that Helen could scarce squeeze her knees through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more Roy climbed out of that canuon, over a ridge into another,\n",
      "down long wooded slopes and through scrub-oak thickets, on and on\n",
      "till the sun stood straight overhead. Then he halted for a short rest,\n",
      "unsaddled the horses to let them roll, and gave the girls some cold\n",
      "lunch that he had packed. He strolled off with his gun, and, upon\n",
      "returning, resaddled and gave the word to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the last of rest and easy traveling for the girls. The forest\n",
      "that he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines\n",
      "so steep of slope as to make precarious travel. Mostly he kept to the\n",
      "bottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail. But it was necessary\n",
      "to cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed, and this\n",
      "crossing was work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close\n",
      "knit. They tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders. Ranger\n",
      "appeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less.\n",
      "Bo's white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place. On\n",
      "the other hand, some of these steep slopes, were comparatively free of\n",
      "underbrush. Great firs and pines loomed up on all sides. The earth was\n",
      "soft and the hoofs sank deep. Toward the bottom of a descent Ranger\n",
      "would brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches. This\n",
      "mode facilitated travel, but it frightened Helen. The climb out then on\n",
      "the other side had to be done on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "After half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way Helen's strength was\n",
      "spent and her breath was gone. She felt light-headed. She could not get\n",
      "enough air. Her feet felt like lead, and her riding-coat was a burden.\n",
      "A hundred times, hot and wet and throbbing, she was compelled to stop.\n",
      "Always she had been a splendid walker and climber. And here, to break up\n",
      "the long ride, she was glad to be on her feet. But she could only drag\n",
      "one foot up after the other. Then, when her nose began to bleed, she\n",
      "realized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble.\n",
      "Her heart, however, did not hurt her, though she was conscious of an\n",
      "oppression on her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest\n",
      "verdure that it appeared impossible to cross. Nevertheless, he started\n",
      "down, dismounting after a little way. Helen found that leading Ranger\n",
      "down was worse than riding him. He came fast and he would step right\n",
      "in her tracks. She was not quick enough to get away from him. Twice\n",
      "he stepped on her foot, and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and\n",
      "threw her flat. When he began to slide, near the bottom, Helen had to\n",
      "run for her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell! Isn't--this--great?” panted Bo, from somewhere ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo--your--mind's--gone,” panted Helen, in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy tried several places to climb out, and failed in each. Leading down\n",
      "the ravine for a hundred yards or more, he essayed another attempt.\n",
      "Here there had been a slide, and in part the earth was bare. When he had\n",
      "worked up this, he halted above, and called:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad place! Keep on the up side of the hosses!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This appeared easier said than done. Helen could not watch Bo, because\n",
      "Ranger would not wait. He pulled at the bridle and snorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Faster you come the better,” called Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not see the sense of that, but she tried. Roy and Bo had dug\n",
      "a deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide. Helen made the mistake\n",
      "of starting to follow in their tracks, and when she realized this Ranger\n",
      "was climbing fast, almost dragging her, and it was too late to get\n",
      "above. Helen began to labor. She slid down right in front of Ranger. The\n",
      "intelligent animal, with a snort, plunged out of the trail to keep from\n",
      "stepping on her. Then he was above her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lookout down there,” yelled Roy, in warning. “Get on the up side!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But that did not appear possible. The earth began to slide under Ranger,\n",
      "and that impeded Helen's progress. He got in advance of her, straining\n",
      "on the bridle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let go!” yelled Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with\n",
      "Ranger. He snorted fiercely, and, rearing high, in a mighty plunge he\n",
      "gained solid ground. Helen was buried to her knees, but, extricating\n",
      "herself, she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad cave-in, thet,” was Roy's comment, when at last she joined him and\n",
      "Bo at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy appeared at a loss as to which way to go. He rode to high ground and\n",
      "looked in all directions. To Helen, one way appeared as wild and rough\n",
      "as another, and all was yellow, green, and black under the westering\n",
      "sun. Roy rode a short distance in one direction, then changed for\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently he stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'm shore turned round,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're not lost?” cried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I've been thet for a couple of hours,” he replied, cheerfully.\n",
      "“Never did ride across here I had the direction, but I'm blamed now if I\n",
      "can tell which way thet was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed at him in consternation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lost!” she echoed.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER IX\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence ensued, fraught with poignant fear for Helen, as she gazed\n",
      "into Bo's whitening face. She read her sister's mind. Bo was remembering\n",
      "tales of lost people who never were found.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me an' Milt get lost every day,” said Roy. “You don't suppose any man\n",
      "can know all this big country. It's nothin' for us to be lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!... I was lost when I was little,” said Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckon it'd been better not to tell you so offhand like,”\n",
      " replied Roy, contritely. “Don't feel bad, now. All I need is a peek at\n",
      "Old Baldy. Then I'll have my bearin'. Come on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's confidence returned as Roy led off at a fast trot. He rode\n",
      "toward the westering sun, keeping to the ridge they had ascended, until\n",
      "once more he came out upon a promontory. Old Baldy loomed there, blacker\n",
      "and higher and closer. The dark forest showed round, yellow, bare spots\n",
      "like parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so far off the track,” said Roy, as he wheeled his horse. “We'll\n",
      "make camp in Milt's senaca to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He led down off the ridge into a valley and then up to higher altitude,\n",
      "where the character of the forest changed. The trees were no longer\n",
      "pines, but firs and spruce, growing thin and exceedingly tall, with\n",
      "few branches below the topmost foliage. So dense was this forest that\n",
      "twilight seemed to have come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel was arduous. Everywhere were windfalls that had to be avoided,\n",
      "and not a rod was there without a fallen tree. The horses, laboring\n",
      "slowly, sometimes sank knee-deep into the brown duff. Gray moss\n",
      "festooned the tree-trunks and an amber-green moss grew thick on the\n",
      "rotting logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen loved this forest primeval. It was so still, so dark, so gloomy,\n",
      "so full of shadows and shade, and a dank smell of rotting wood, and\n",
      "sweet fragrance of spruce. The great windfalls, where trees were jammed\n",
      "together in dozens, showed the savagery of the storms. Wherever a single\n",
      "monarch lay uprooted there had sprung up a number of ambitious sons,\n",
      "jealous of one another, fighting for place. Even the trees fought one\n",
      "another! The forest was a place of mystery, but its strife could be read\n",
      "by any eye. The lightnings had split firs clear to the roots, and others\n",
      "it had circled with ripping tear from top to trunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time came, however, when the exceeding wildness of the forest, in\n",
      "density and fallen timber, made it imperative for Helen to put all her\n",
      "attention on the ground and trees in her immediate vicinity. So the\n",
      "pleasure of gazing ahead at the beautiful wilderness was denied her.\n",
      "Thereafter travel became toil and the hours endless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy led on, and Ranger followed, while the shadows darkened under the\n",
      "trees. She was reeling in her saddle, half blind and sick, when Roy\n",
      "called out cheerily that they were almost there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever his idea was, to Helen it seemed many miles that she followed\n",
      "him farther, out of the heavy-timbered forest down upon slopes of low\n",
      "spruce, like evergreen, which descended sharply to another level, where\n",
      "dark, shallow streams flowed gently and the solemn stillness held a low\n",
      "murmur of falling water, and at last the wood ended upon a wonderful\n",
      "park full of a thick, rich, golden light of fast-fading sunset.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Smell the smoke,” said Roy. “By Solomon! if Milt ain't here ahead of\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He rode on. Helen's weary gaze took in the round senaca, the circling\n",
      "black slopes, leading up to craggy rims all gold and red in the\n",
      "last flare of the sun; then all the spirit left in her flashed up in\n",
      "thrilling wonder at this exquisite, wild, and colorful spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horses were grazing out in the long grass and there were deer grazing\n",
      "with them. Roy led round a corner of the fringed, bordering woodland,\n",
      "and there, under lofty trees, shone a camp-fire. Huge gray rocks loomed\n",
      "beyond, and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain\n",
      "wall, over which poured a thin, lacy waterfall. As Helen gazed in\n",
      "rapture the sunset gold faded to white and all the western slope of the\n",
      "amphitheater darkened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's tall form appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you're late,” he said, as with a comprehensive flash of eye he\n",
      "took in the three.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I got lost,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feared as much.... You girls look like you'd done better to ride with\n",
      "me,” went on Dale, as he offered a hand to help Bo off. She took it,\n",
      "tried to get her foot out of the stirrups, and then she slid from the\n",
      "saddle into Dale's arms. He placed her on her feet and, supporting her,\n",
      "said, solicitously: “A hundred-mile ride in three days for a tenderfoot\n",
      "is somethin' your uncle Al won't believe.... Come, walk if it kills\n",
      "you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon he led Bo, very much as if he were teaching a child to walk.\n",
      "The fact that the voluble Bo had nothing to say was significant to\n",
      "Helen, who was following, with the assistance of Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the huge rocks resembled a sea-shell in that it contained a\n",
      "hollow over which the wide-spreading shelf flared out. It reached toward\n",
      "branches of great pines. A spring burst from a crack in the solid rock.\n",
      "The campfire blazed under a pine, and the blue column of smoke rose just\n",
      "in front of the shelving rock. Packs were lying on the grass and some\n",
      "of them were open. There were no signs here of a permanent habitation of\n",
      "the hunter. But farther on were other huge rocks, leaning, cracked, and\n",
      "forming caverns, some of which perhaps he utilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My camp is just back,” said Dale, as if he had read Helen's mind.\n",
      "“To-morrow we'll fix up comfortable-like round here for you girls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen and Bo were made as easy as blankets and saddles could make them,\n",
      "and the men went about their tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--isn't this--a dream?” murmured Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, child. It's real--terribly real,” replied Helen. “Now that we're\n",
      "here--with that awful ride over--we can think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's so pretty--here,” yawned Bo. “I'd just as lief Uncle Al didn't\n",
      "find us very soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! He's a sick man. Think what the worry will be to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet if he knows Dale he won't be so worried.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale told us Uncle Al disliked him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pooh! What difference does that make?... Oh, I don't know which I\n",
      "am--hungrier or tireder!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn't eat to-night,” said Helen, wearily.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she stretched out she had a vague, delicious sensation that that\n",
      "was the end of Helen Rayner, and she was glad. Above her, through the\n",
      "lacy, fernlike pine-needles, she saw blue sky and a pale star just\n",
      "showing. Twilight was stealing down swiftly. The silence was beautiful,\n",
      "seemingly undisturbed by the soft, silky, dreamy fall of water. Helen\n",
      "closed her eyes, ready for sleep, with the physical commotion within her\n",
      "body gradually yielding. In some places her bones felt as if they had\n",
      "come out through her flesh; in others throbbed deep-seated aches; her\n",
      "muscles appeared slowly to subside, to relax, with the quivering twinges\n",
      "ceasing one by one; through muscle and bone, through all her body,\n",
      "pulsed a burning current.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's head dropped on Helen's shoulder. Sense became vague to Helen. She\n",
      "lost the low murmur of the waterfall, and then the sound or feeling of\n",
      "some one at the campfire. And her last conscious thought was that she\n",
      "tried to open her eyes and could not.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she awoke all was bright. The sun shone almost directly overhead.\n",
      "Helen was astounded. Bo lay wrapped in deep sleep, her face flushed,\n",
      "with beads of perspiration on her brow and the chestnut curls damp.\n",
      "Helen threw down the blankets, and then, gathering courage--for she felt\n",
      "as if her back was broken--she endeavored to sit up. In vain! Her spirit\n",
      "was willing, but her muscles refused to act. It must take a violent\n",
      "spasmodic effort. She tried it with shut eyes, and, succeeding, sat\n",
      "there trembling. The commotion she had made in the blankets awoke Bo,\n",
      "and she blinked her surprised blue eyes in the sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello--Nell! do I have to--get up?” she asked, sleepily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you?” queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can I what?” Bo was now thoroughly awake and lay there staring at her\n",
      "sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--get up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd like to know why not,” retorted Bo, as she made the effort. She got\n",
      "one arm and shoulder up, only to flop back like a crippled thing. And\n",
      "she uttered the most piteous little moan. “I'm dead! I know--I am!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if you're going to be a Western girl you'd better have spunk\n",
      "enough to move.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” ejaculated Bo. Then she rolled over, not without groans, and,\n",
      "once upon her face, she raised herself on her hands and turned to a\n",
      "sitting posture. “Where's everybody?... Oh, Nell, it's perfectly lovely\n",
      "here. Paradise!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen looked around. A fire was smoldering. No one was in sight.\n",
      "Wonderful distant colors seemed to strike her glance as she tried to fix\n",
      "it upon near-by objects. A beautiful little green tent or shack had been\n",
      "erected out of spruce boughs. It had a slanting roof that sloped all the\n",
      "way from a ridge-pole to the ground; half of the opening in front was\n",
      "closed, as were the sides. The spruce boughs appeared all to be laid in\n",
      "the same direction, giving it a smooth, compact appearance, actually as\n",
      "if it had grown there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That lean-to wasn't there last night?” inquired Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn't see it. Lean-to? Where'd you get that name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's Western, my dear. I'll bet they put it up for us.... Sure, I see\n",
      "our bags inside. Let's get up. It must be late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls had considerable fun as well as pain in getting up and keeping\n",
      "each other erect until their limbs would hold them firmly. They were\n",
      "delighted with the spruce lean-to. It faced the open and stood just\n",
      "under the wide-spreading shelf of rock. The tiny outlet from the spring\n",
      "flowed beside it and spilled its clear water over a stone, to fall into\n",
      "a little pool. The floor of this woodland habitation consisted of tips\n",
      "of spruce boughs to about a foot in depth, all laid one way, smooth and\n",
      "springy, and so sweetly odorous that the air seemed intoxicating. Helen\n",
      "and Bo opened their baggage, and what with use of the cold water, brush\n",
      "and comb, and clean blouses, they made themselves feel as comfortable as\n",
      "possible, considering the excruciating aches. Then they went out to the\n",
      "campfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's eye was attracted by moving objects near at hand. Then\n",
      "simultaneously with Bo's cry of delight Helen saw a beautiful doe\n",
      "approaching under the trees. Dale walked beside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You sure had a long sleep,” was the hunter's greeting. “I reckon you\n",
      "both look better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good morning. Or is it afternoon? We're just able to move about,” said\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could ride,” declared Bo, stoutly. “Oh, Nell, look at the deer! It's\n",
      "coming to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doe had hung back a little as Dale reached the camp-fire. It was a\n",
      "gray, slender creature, smooth as silk, with great dark eyes. It stood a\n",
      "moment, long ears erect, and then with a graceful little trot came up\n",
      "to Bo and reached a slim nose for her outstretched hand. All about it,\n",
      "except the beautiful soft eyes, seemed wild, and yet it was as tame as\n",
      "a kitten. Then, suddenly, as Bo fondled the long ears, it gave a start\n",
      "and, breaking away, ran back out of sight under the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What frightened it?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale pointed up at the wall under the shelving roof of rock. There,\n",
      "twenty feet from the ground, curled up on a ledge, lay a huge tawny\n",
      "animal with a face like that of a cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's afraid of Tom,” replied Dale. “Recognizes him as a hereditary\n",
      "foe, I guess. I can't make friends of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So that's Tom--the pet lion!” exclaimed Bo. “Ugh! No wonder that\n",
      "deer ran off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long has he been up there?” queried Helen, gazing fascinated at\n",
      "Dale's famous pet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn't say. Tom comes an' goes,” replied Dale. “But I sent him up\n",
      "there last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he was there--perfectly free--right over us--while we slept!” burst\n",
      "out Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. An' I reckon you slept the safer for that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of all things! Nell, isn't he a monster? But he doesn't look like a\n",
      "lion--an African lion. He's a panther. I saw his like at the circus\n",
      "once.”\n",

      "“He's a cougar,” said Dale. “The panther is long and slim. Tom is not\n",
      "only long, but thick an' round. I've had him four years. An' he was a\n",
      "kitten no bigger 'n my fist when I got him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he perfectly tame--safe?” asked Helen, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've never told anybody that Tom was safe, but he is,” replied Dale.\n",
      "“You can absolutely believe it. A wild cougar wouldn't attack a man\n",
      "unless cornered or starved. An' Tom is like a big kitten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The beast raised his great catlike face, with its sleepy, half-shut\n",
      "eyes, and looked down upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall I call him down?” inquired Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "For once Bo did not find her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us--get a little more used to him--at a distance,” replied Helen,\n",
      "with a little laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he comes to you, just rub his head an' you'll see how tame he is,”\n",
      " said Dale. “Reckon you're both hungry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so very,” returned Helen, aware of his penetrating gray gaze upon\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I am,” vouchsafed Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soon as the turkey's done we'll eat. My camp is round between the\n",
      "rocks. I'll call you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not until his broad back was turned did Helen notice that the hunter\n",
      "looked different. Then she saw he wore a lighter, cleaner suit of\n",
      "buckskin, with no coat, and instead of the high-heeled horseman's boots\n",
      "he wore moccasins and leggings. The change made him appear more lithe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I don't know what you think, but _I_ call him handsome,” declared\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had no idea what she thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's try to walk some,” she suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they essayed that painful task and got as far as a pine log some few\n",
      "rods from their camp. This point was close to the edge of the park, from\n",
      "which there was an unobstructed view.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My! What a place!” exclaimed Bo, with eyes wide and round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, beautiful!” breathed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unexpected blaze of color drew her gaze first. Out of the black\n",
      "spruce slopes shone patches of aspens, gloriously red and gold, and low\n",
      "down along the edge of timber troops of aspens ran out into the park,\n",
      "not yet so blazing as those above, but purple and yellow and white in\n",
      "the sunshine. Masses of silver spruce, like trees in moonlight, bordered\n",
      "the park, sending out here and there an isolated tree, sharp as a\n",
      "spear, with under-branches close to the ground. Long golden-green grass,\n",
      "resembling half-ripe wheat, covered the entire floor of the park, gently\n",
      "waving to the wind. Above sheered the black, gold-patched slopes, steep\n",
      "and unscalable, rising to buttresses of dark, iron-hued rock. And to\n",
      "the east circled the rows of cliff-bench, gray and old and fringed,\n",
      "splitting at the top in the notch where the lacy, slumberous waterfall,\n",
      "like white smoke, fell and vanished, to reappear in wider sheet of lace,\n",
      "only to fall and vanish again in the green depths.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a verdant valley, deep-set in the mountain walls, wild and sad\n",
      "and lonesome. The waterfall dominated the spirit of the place, dreamy\n",
      "and sleepy and tranquil; it murmured sweetly on one breath of wind, and\n",
      "lulled with another, and sometimes died out altogether, only to come\n",
      "again in soft, strange roar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Paradise Park!” whispered Bo to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A call from Dale disturbed their raptures. Turning, they hobbled with\n",
      "eager but painful steps in the direction of a larger camp-fire, situated\n",
      "to the right of the great rock that sheltered their lean-to. No hut or\n",
      "house showed there and none was needed. Hiding-places and homes for a\n",
      "hundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs, split off\n",
      "in bygone ages from the mountain wall above. A few stately pines stood\n",
      "out from the rocks, and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown\n",
      "brook. This camp was only a step from the lean-to, round the corner of\n",
      "a huge rock, yet it had been out of sight. Here indeed was evidence of\n",
      "a hunter's home--pelts and skins and antlers, a neat pile of split\n",
      "fire-wood, a long ledge of rock, well sheltered, and loaded with\n",
      "bags like a huge pantry-shelf, packs and ropes and saddles, tools and\n",
      "weapons, and a platform of dry brush as shelter for a fire around which\n",
      "hung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hyar--you git!” shouted Dale, and he threw a stick at something. A bear\n",
      "cub scampered away in haste. He was small and woolly and brown, and he\n",
      "grunted as he ran. Soon he halted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's Bud,” said Dale, as the girls came up. “Guess he near starved in\n",
      "my absence. An' now he wants everythin', especially the sugar. We don't\n",
      "have sugar often up here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn't he dear? Oh, I love him!” cried Bo. “Come back, Bud. Come,\n",
      "Buddie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cub, however, kept his distance, watching Dale with bright little\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Mr. Roy?” asked Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy's gone. He was sorry not to say good-by. But it's important he gets\n",
      "down in the pines on Anson's trail. He'll hang to Anson, an' in case\n",
      "they get near Pine he'll ride in to see where your uncle is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you expect?” questioned Helen, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Most anythin',” he replied. “Al, I reckon, knows now. Maybe he's\n",
      "rustlin' into the mountains by this time. If he meets up with Anson,\n",
      "well an' good, for Roy won't be far off. An' sure if he runs across Roy,\n",
      "why they'll soon be here. But if I were you I wouldn't count on seein'\n",
      "your uncle very soon. I'm sorry. I've done my best. It sure is a bad\n",
      "deal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't think me ungracious,” replied Helen, hastily. How plainly he\n",
      "had intimated that it must be privation and annoyance for her to be\n",
      "compelled to accept his hospitality! “You are good--kind. I owe you\n",
      "much. I'll be eternally grateful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale straightened as he looked at her. His glance was intent, piercing.\n",
      "He seemed to be receiving a strange or unusual portent. No need for him\n",
      "to say he had never before been spoken to like that!\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may have to stay here with me--for weeks--maybe months--if we've\n",
      "the bad luck to get snowed in,” he said, slowly, as if startled at this\n",
      "deduction. “You're safe here. No sheep-thief could ever find this camp.\n",
      "I'll take risks to get you safe into Al's hands. But I'm goin' to be\n",
      "pretty sure about what I'm doin'.... So--there's plenty to eat an' it's\n",
      "a pretty place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty! Why, it's grand!” exclaimed Bo. “I've called it Paradise Park.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Paradise Park,” he repeated, weighing the words. “You've named it an'\n",
      "also the creek. Paradise Creek! I've been here twelve years with no fit\n",
      "name for my home till you said that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, that pleases me!” returned Bo, with shining eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eat now,” said Dale. “An' I reckon you'll like that turkey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a clean tarpaulin upon which were spread steaming, fragrant\n",
      "pans--roast turkey, hot biscuits and gravy, mashed potatoes as white as\n",
      "if prepared at home, stewed dried apples, and butter and coffee. This\n",
      "bounteous repast surprised and delighted the girls; when they had once\n",
      "tasted the roast wild turkey, then Milt Dale had occasion to blush at\n",
      "their encomiums.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope--Uncle Al--doesn't come for a month,” declared Bo, as she tried\n",
      "to get her breath. There was a brown spot on her nose and one on each\n",
      "cheek, suspiciously close to her mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale laughed. It was pleasant to hear him, for his laugh seemed unused\n",
      "and deep, as if it came from tranquil depths.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Won't you eat with us?” asked Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I will,” he said, “it'll save time, an' hot grub tastes better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite an interval of silence ensued, which presently was broken by Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here comes Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen observed with a thrill that the cougar was magnificent, seen erect\n",
      "on all-fours, approaching with slow, sinuous grace. His color was tawny,\n",
      "with spots of whitish gray. He had bow-legs, big and round and furry,\n",
      "and a huge head with great tawny eyes. No matter how tame he was said\n",
      "to be, he looked wild. Like a dog he walked right up, and it so happened\n",
      "that he was directly behind Bo, within reach of her when she turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Lord!” cried Bo, and up went both of her hands, in one of which\n",
      "was a huge piece of turkey. Tom took it, not viciously, but nevertheless\n",
      "with a snap that made Helen jump. As if by magic the turkey vanished.\n",
      "And Tom took a closer step toward Bo. Her expression of fright changed\n",
      "to consternation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He stole my turkey!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, come here,” ordered Dale, sharply. The cougar glided round rather\n",
      "sheepishly. “Now lie down an' behave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom crouched on all-fours, his head resting on his paws, with his\n",
      "beautiful tawny eyes, light and piercing, fixed upon the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't grab,” said Dale, holding out a piece of turkey. Whereupon Tom\n",
      "took it less voraciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happened, the little bear cub saw this transaction, and he plainly\n",
      "indicated his opinion of the preference shown to Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, the dear!” exclaimed Bo. “He means it's not fair.... Come,\n",
      "Bud--come on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bud would not approach the group until called by Dale. Then he\n",
      "scrambled to them with every manifestation of delight. Bo almost forgot\n",
      "her own needs in feeding him and getting acquainted with him. Tom\n",
      "plainly showed his jealousy of Bud, and Bud likewise showed his fear of\n",
      "the great cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not believe the evidence of her eyes--that she was in the\n",
      "woods calmly and hungrily partaking of sweet, wild-flavored meat--that\n",
      "a full-grown mountain lion lay on one side of her and a baby brown bear\n",
      "sat on the other--that a strange hunter, a man of the forest, there in\n",
      "his lonely and isolated fastness, appealed to the romance in her and\n",
      "interested her as no one else she had ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the wonderful meal was at last finished Bo enticed the bear cub\n",
      "around to the camp of the girls, and there soon became great comrades\n",
      "with him. Helen, watching Bo play, was inclined to envy her. No matter\n",
      "where Bo was placed, she always got something out of it. She adapted\n",
      "herself. She, who could have a good time with almost any one or\n",
      "anything, would find the hours sweet and fleeting in this beautiful park\n",
      "of wild wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "But merely objective actions--merely physical movements, had never yet\n",
      "contented Helen. She could run and climb and ride and play with hearty\n",
      "and healthy abandon, but those things would not suffice long for her,\n",
      "and her mind needed food. Helen was a thinker. One reason she had\n",
      "desired to make her home in the West was that by taking up a life of the\n",
      "open, of action, she might think and dream and brood less. And here she\n",
      "was in the wild West, after the three most strenuously active days of\n",
      "her career, and still the same old giant revolved her mind and turned it\n",
      "upon herself and upon all she saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can I do?” she asked Bo, almost helplessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, rest, you silly!” retorted Bo. “You walk like an old, crippled\n",
      "woman with only one leg.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen hoped the comparison was undeserved, but the advice was sound.\n",
      "The blankets spread out on the grass looked inviting and they felt\n",
      "comfortably warm in the sunshine. The breeze was slow, languorous,\n",
      "fragrant, and it brought the low hum of the murmuring waterfall, like\n",
      "a melody of bees. Helen made a pillow and lay down to rest. The green\n",
      "pine-needles, so thin and fine in their crisscross network, showed\n",
      "clearly against the blue sky. She looked in vain for birds. Then\n",
      "her gaze went wonderingly to the lofty fringed rim of the great\n",
      "amphitheater, and as she studied it she began to grasp its remoteness,\n",
      "how far away it was in the rarefied atmosphere. A black eagle, sweeping\n",
      "along, looked of tiny size, and yet he was far under the heights above.\n",
      "How pleasant she fancied it to be up there! And drowsy fancy lulled her\n",
      "to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen slept all afternoon, and upon awakening, toward sunset, found Bo\n",
      "curled beside her. Dale had thoughtfully covered them with a blanket;\n",
      "also he had built a camp-fire. The air was growing keen and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, when they had put their coats on and made comfortable seats\n",
      "beside the fire, Dale came over, apparently to visit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you can't sleep all the time,” he said. “An' bein' city girls,\n",
      "you'll get lonesome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lonesome!” echoed Helen. The idea of her being lonesome here had not\n",
      "occurred to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've thought that all out,” went on Dale, as he sat down, Indian\n",
      "fashion, before the blaze. “It's natural you'd find time drag up here,\n",
      "bein' used to lots of people an' goin's-on, an' work, an' all girls\n",
      "like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd never be lonesome here,” replied Helen, with her direct force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale did not betray surprise, but he showed that his mistake was\n",
      "something to ponder over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me,” he said, presently, as his gray eyes held hers. “That's\n",
      "how I had it. As I remember girls--an' it doesn't seem long since I left\n",
      "home--most of them would die of lonesomeness up here.” Then he addressed\n",
      "himself to Bo. “How about you? You see, I figured you'd be the one that\n",
      "liked it, an' your sister the one who wouldn't.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't get lonesome very soon,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm glad. It worried me some--not ever havin' girls as company before.\n",
      "An' in a day or so, when you're rested, I'll help you pass the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's eyes were full of flashing interest, and Helen asked him, “How?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sincere expression of her curiosity and not doubtful or\n",
      "ironic challenge of an educated woman to a man of the forest. But as a\n",
      "challenge he took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How!” he repeated, and a strange smile flitted across his face. “Why,\n",
      "by givin' you rides an' climbs to beautiful places. An' then, if you're\n",
      "interested,' to show you how little so-called civilized people know of\n",
      "nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen realized then that whatever his calling, hunter or wanderer or\n",
      "hermit, he was not uneducated, even if he appeared illiterate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be happy to learn from you,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me, too!” chimed in Bo. “You can't tell too much to any one from\n",
      "Missouri.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled, and that warmed Helen to him, for then he seemed less removed\n",
      "from other people. About this hunter there began to be something of the\n",
      "very nature of which he spoke--a stillness, aloofness, an unbreakable\n",
      "tranquillity, a cold, clear spirit like that in the mountain air, a\n",
      "physical something not unlike the tamed wildness of his pets or the\n",
      "strength of the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet I can tell you more 'n you'll ever remember,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What 'll you bet?” retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, more roast turkey against--say somethin' nice when you're safe\n",
      "an' home to your uncle Al's, runnin' his ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Agreed. Nell, you hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen nodded her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right. We'll leave it to Nell,” began Dale, half seriously. “Now\n",
      "I'll tell you, first, for the fun of passin' time we'll ride an' race\n",
      "my horses out in the park. An' we'll fish in the brooks an' hunt in the\n",
      "woods. There's an old silvertip around that you can see me kill. An'\n",
      "we'll climb to the peaks an' see wonderful sights.... So much for\n",
      "that. Now, if you really want to learn--or if you only want me to tell\n",
      "you--well, that's no matter. Only I'll win the bet!... You'll see\n",
      "how this park lies in the crater of a volcano an' was once full of\n",
      "water--an' how the snow blows in on one side in winter, a hundred feet\n",
      "deep, when there's none on the other. An' the trees--how they grow an'\n",
      "live an' fight one another an' depend on one another, an' protect\n",
      "the forest from storm-winds. An' how they hold the water that is the\n",
      "fountains of the great rivers. An' how the creatures an' things that\n",
      "live in them or on them are good for them, an' neither could live\n",
      "without the other. An' then I'll show you my pets tame an' untamed, an'\n",
      "tell you how it's man that makes any creature wild--how easy they are\n",
      "to tame--an' how they learn to love you. An' there's the life of the\n",
      "forest, the strife of it--how the bear lives, an' the cats, an' the\n",
      "wolves, an' the deer. You'll see how cruel nature is how savage an'\n",
      "wild the wolf or cougar tears down the deer--how a wolf loves fresh, hot\n",
      "blood, an' how a cougar unrolls the skin of a deer back from his neck.\n",
      "An' you'll see that this cruelty of nature--this work of the wolf an'\n",
      "cougar--is what makes the deer so beautiful an' healthy an' swift an'\n",
      "sensitive. Without his deadly foes the deer would deteriorate an' die\n",
      "out. An' you'll see how this principle works out among all creatures of\n",
      "the forest. Strife! It's the meanin' of all creation, an' the salvation.\n",
      "If you're quick to see, you'll learn that the nature here in the wilds\n",
      "is the same as that of men--only men are no longer cannibals. Trees\n",
      "fight to live--birds fight--animals fight--men fight. They all live\n",
      "off one another. An' it's this fightin' that brings them all closer an'\n",
      "closer to bein' perfect. But nothin' will ever be perfect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how about religion?” interrupted Helen, earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nature has a religion, an' it's to live--to grow--to reproduce, each of\n",
      "its kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that is not God or the immortality of the soul,” declared Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it's as close to God an' immortality as nature ever gets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you would rob me of my religion!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I just talk as I see life,” replied Dale, reflectively, as he poked\n",
      "a stick into the red embers of the fire. “Maybe I have a religion. I\n",
      "don't know. But it's not the kind you have--not the Bible kind. That\n",
      "kind doesn't keep the men in Pine an' Snowdrop an' all over--sheepmen\n",
      "an' ranchers an' farmers an' travelers, such as I've known--the religion\n",
      "they profess doesn't keep them from lyin', cheatin', stealin', an'\n",
      "killin'. I reckon no man who lives as I do--which perhaps is my\n",
      "religion--will lie or cheat or steal or kill, unless it's to kill in\n",
      "self-defense or like I'd do if Snake Anson would ride up here now.\n",

      "with me. An' that's It! Call it God if you like. But what stalls me\n",

      "“Terrible? I reckon,” he replied, sadly.\n",
      "\n",

      "frivolity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd forgotten that. Reckon I talked a lot,” he said, apologetically.\n",
      "“You see, I don't get much chance to talk, except to myself or Tom.\n",

      "“I could listen to you all night,” returned Bo, dreamily.\n",

      "“Do you read--do you have books?” inquired Helen, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I read tolerable well; a good deal better than I talk or write,”\n",
      " he replied. “I went to school till I was fifteen. Always hated study,\n",
      "but liked to read. Years ago an old friend of mine down here at\n",
      "Pine--Widow Cass--she gave me a lot of old books. An' I packed them up\n",
      "here. Winter's the time I read.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversation lagged after that, except for desultory remarks, and\n",
      "presently Dale bade the girls good night and left them. Helen watched\n",
      "his tall form vanish in the gloom under the pines, and after he had\n",
      "disappeared she still stared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!” called Bo, shrilly. “I've called you three times. I want to go\n",
      "to bed.”\n",
      "\n",

      "wondering at herself. “I didn't hear you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should smile you didn't,” retorted Bo. “Wish you could just have seen\n",
      "your eyes. Nell, do you want me to tell you something?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--yes,” said Helen, rather feebly. She did not at all, when Bo\n",
      "talked like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're going to fall in love with that wild hunter,” declared Bo in a\n",
      "voice that rang like a bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was not only amazed, but enraged. She caught her breath\n",
      "preparatory to giving this incorrigible sister a piece of her mind. Bo\n",

      "CHAPTER X\n",
      "\n",
      "The night of sleep was so short that it was difficult for Helen to\n",
      "believe that hours had passed. Bo appeared livelier this morning, with\n",
      "less complaint of aches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, you've got color!” exclaimed Bo. “And your eyes are bright. Isn't\n",
      "the morning perfectly lovely?... Couldn't you get drunk on that air? I\n",
      "smell flowers. And oh! I'm hungry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, our host will soon have need of his hunting abilities if your\n",
      "appetite holds,” said Helen, as she tried to keep her hair out of her\n",
      "eyes while she laced her boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! there's a big dog--a hound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen looked as Bo directed, and saw a hound of unusually large\n",
      "proportions, black and tan in color, with long, drooping ears. Curiously\n",
      "he trotted nearer to the door of their hut and then stopped to gaze at\n",
      "them. His head was noble, his eyes shone dark and sad. He seemed neither\n",
      "friendly nor unfriendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, doggie! Come right in--we won't hurt you,” called Bo, but\n",
      "without enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "This made Helen laugh. “Bo, you're simply delicious,” she said. “You're\n",
      "afraid of that dog.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. Wonder if he's Dale's. Of course he must be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the hound trotted away out of sight. When the girls presented\n",
      "themselves at the camp-fire they espied their curious canine visitor\n",
      "lying down. His ears were so long that half of them lay on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sent Pedro over to wake you girls up,” said Dale, after greeting\n",
      "them. “Did he scare you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pedro. So that's his name. No, he didn't exactly scare me. He did Nell,\n",
      "though. She's an awful tenderfoot,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's a splendid-looking dog,” said Helen, ignoring her sister's sally.\n",
      "“I love dogs. Will he make friends?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's shy an' wild. You see, when I leave camp he won't hang around. He\n",
      "an' Tom are jealous of each other. I had a pack of hounds an' lost all\n",
      "but Pedro on account of Tom. I think you can make friends with Pedro.\n",
      "Try it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Helen made overtures to Pedro, and not wholly in vain. The\n",
      "dog was matured, of almost stern aloofness, and manifestly not used to\n",
      "people. His deep, wine-dark eyes seemed to search Helen's soul. They\n",
      "were honest and wise, with a strange sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He looks intelligent,” observed Helen, as she smoothed the long, dark\n",
      "ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That hound is nigh human,” responded Dale. “Come, an' while you eat\n",
      "I'll tell you about Pedro.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had gotten the hound as a pup from a Mexican sheep-herder who\n",
      "claimed he was part California bloodhound. He grew up, becoming attached\n",
      "to Dale. In his younger days he did not get along well with Dale's other\n",
      "pets and Dale gave him to a rancher down in the valley. Pedro was back\n",
      "in Dale's camp next day. From that day Dale began to care more for the\n",
      "hound, but he did not want to keep him, for various reasons, chief of\n",
      "which was the fact that Pedro was too fine a dog to be left alone half\n",
      "the time to shift for himself. That fall Dale had need to go to the\n",
      "farthest village, Snowdrop, where he left Pedro with a friend. Then Dale\n",
      "rode to Show Down and Pine, and the camp of the Beemans' and with them\n",
      "he trailed some wild horses for a hundred miles, over into New Mexico.\n",
      "The snow was flying when Dale got back to his camp in the mountains.\n",
      "And there was Pedro, gaunt and worn, overjoyed to welcome him home. Roy\n",
      "Beeman visited Dale that October and told that Dale's friend in Snowdrop\n",
      "had not been able to keep Pedro. He broke a chain and scaled a ten-foot\n",
      "fence to escape. He trailed Dale to Show Down, where one of Dale's\n",
      "friends, recognizing the hound, caught him, and meant to keep him until\n",
      "Dale's return. But Pedro refused to eat. It happened that a freighter\n",
      "was going out to the Beeman camp, and Dale's friend boxed Pedro up and\n",
      "put him on the wagon. Pedro broke out of the box, returned to Show Down,\n",
      "took up Dale's trail to Pine, and then on to the Beeman camp. That was\n",
      "as far as Roy could trace the movements of the hound. But he believed,\n",
      "and so did Dale, that Pedro had trailed them out on the wild-horse hunt.\n",
      "The following spring Dale learned more from the herder of a sheepman at\n",
      "whose camp he and the Beemans; had rested on the way into New Mexico.\n",
      "It appeared that after Dale had left this camp Pedro had arrived, and\n",
      "another Mexican herder had stolen the hound. But Pedro got away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' he was here when I arrived,” concluded Dale, smiling. “I never\n",
      "wanted to get rid of him after that. He's turned out to be the finest\n",
      "dog I ever knew. He knows what I say. He can almost talk. An' I swear he\n",
      "can cry. He does whenever I start off without him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How perfectly wonderful!” exclaimed Bo. “Aren't animals great?... But I\n",
      "love horses best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Helen that Pedro understood they were talking about him,\n",
      "for he looked ashamed, and swallowed hard, and dropped his gaze. She\n",
      "knew something of the truth about the love of dogs for their owners.\n",
      "This story of Dale's, however, was stranger than any she had ever heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom, the cougar, put in an appearance then, and there was scarcely love\n",
      "in the tawny eyes he bent upon Pedro. But the hound did not deign to\n",
      "notice him. Tom sidled up to Bo, who sat on the farther side of the\n",
      "tarpaulin table-cloth, and manifestly wanted part of her breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee! I love the look of him,” she said. “But when he's close he makes\n",
      "my flesh creep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasts are as queer as people,” observed Dale. “They take likes an'\n",
      "dislikes. I believe Tom has taken a shine to you an' Pedro begins to be\n",
      "interested in your sister. I can tell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Bud?” inquired Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's asleep or around somewhere. Now, soon as I get the work done, what\n",
      "would you girls like to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride!” declared Bo, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aren't you sore an' stiff?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am that. But I don't care. Besides, when I used to go out to my\n",
      "uncle's farm near Saint Joe I always found riding to be a cure for\n",
      "aches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure is, if you can stand it. An' what will your sister like to do?”\n",
      " returned Dale, turning to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I'll rest, and watch you folks--and dream,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But after you've rested you must be active,” said Dale, seriously. “You\n",
      "must do things. It doesn't matter what, just as long as you don't sit\n",
      "idle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” queried Helen, in surprise. “Why not be idle here in this\n",
      "beautiful, wild place? just to dream away the hours--the days! I could\n",
      "do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you mustn't. It took me years to learn how bad that was for me. An'\n",
      "right now I would love nothin' more than to forget my work, my horses\n",
      "an' pets--everythin', an' just lay around, seein' an' feelin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seeing and feeling? Yes, that must be what I mean. But why--what is\n",
      "it? There are the beauty and color--the wild, shaggy slopes--the gray\n",
      "cliffs--the singing wind--the lulling water--the clouds--the sky. And\n",
      "the silence, loneliness, sweetness of it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a driftin' back. What I love to do an' yet fear most. It's what\n",
      "makes a lone hunter of a man. An' it can grow so strong that it binds a\n",
      "man to the wilds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How strange!” murmured Helen. “But that could never bind ME. Why, I\n",
      "must live and fulfil my mission, my work in the civilized world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Helen that Dale almost imperceptibly shrank at her earnest\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ways of Nature are strange,” he said. “I look at it different.\n",
      "Nature's just as keen to wean you back to a savage state as you are to\n",
      "be civilized. An' if Nature won, you would carry out her design all the\n",
      "better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This hunter's talk shocked Helen and yet stimulated her mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me--a savage? Oh no!” she exclaimed. “But, if that were possible, what\n",
      "would Nature's design be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You spoke of your mission in life,” he replied. “A woman's mission is\n",
      "to have children. The female of any species has only one mission--to\n",
      "reproduce its kind. An' Nature has only one mission--toward greater\n",
      "strength, virility, efficiency--absolute perfection, which is\n",
      "unattainable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What of mental and spiritual development of man and woman?” asked\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both are direct obstacles to the design of Nature. Nature is physical.\n",
      "To create for limitless endurance for eternal life. That must be\n",
      "Nature's inscrutable design. An' why she must fail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the soul!” whispered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! When you speak of the soul an' I speak of life we mean the same.\n",
      "You an' I will have some talks while you're here. I must brush up my\n",
      "thoughts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So must I, it seems,” said Helen, with a slow smile. She had been\n",
      "rendered grave and thoughtful. “But I guess I'll risk dreaming under the\n",
      "pines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had been watching them with her keen blue eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, it'd take a thousand years to make a savage of you,” she said.\n",
      "“But a week will do for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you were one before you left Saint Joe,” replied Helen. “Don't you\n",
      "remember that school-teacher Barnes who said you were a wildcat and an\n",
      "Indian mixed? He spanked you with a ruler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never! He missed me,” retorted Bo, with red in her cheeks. “Nell, I\n",
      "wish you'd not tell things about me when I was a kid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was only two years ago,” expostulated Helen, in mild surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose it was. I was a kid all right. I'll bet you--” Bo broke up\n",
      "abruptly, and, tossing her head, she gave Tom a pat and then ran away\n",
      "around the corner of cliff wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen followed leisurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Nell,” said Bo, when Helen arrived at their little green\n",
      "ledge-pole hut, “do you know that hunter fellow will upset some of your\n",
      "theories?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe. I'll admit he amazes me--and affronts me, too, I'm afraid,”\n",
      " replied Helen. “What surprises me is that in spite of his evident lack\n",
      "of schooling he's not raw or crude. He's elemental.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sister dear, wake up. The man's wonderful. You can learn more from\n",
      "him than you ever learned in your life. So can I. I always hated books,\n",
      "anyway.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When, a little later, Dale approached carrying some bridles, the hound\n",
      "Pedro trotted at his heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you'd better ride the horse you had,” he said to Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever you say. But I hope you let me ride them all, by and by.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. I've a mustang out there you'll like. But he pitches a little,”\n",
      " he rejoined, and turned away toward the park. The hound looked after him\n",
      "and then at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Pedro. Stay with me,” called Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, hearing her, motioned the hound back. Obediently Pedro trotted to\n",
      "her, still shy and soberly watchful, as if not sure of her intentions,\n",
      "but with something of friendliness about him now. Helen found a soft,\n",
      "restful seat in the sun facing the park, and there composed herself for\n",
      "what she felt would be slow, sweet, idle hours. Pedro curled down beside\n",
      "her. The tall form of Dale stalked across the park, out toward the\n",
      "straggling horses. Again she saw a deer grazing among them. How erect\n",
      "and motionless it stood watching Dale! Presently it bounded away toward\n",
      "the edge of the forest. Some of the horses whistled and ran, kicking\n",
      "heels high in the air. The shrill whistles rang clear in the stillness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gee! Look at them go!” exclaimed Bo, gleefully, coming up to where\n",
      "Helen sat. Bo threw herself down upon the fragrant pine-needles and\n",
      "stretched herself languorously, like a lazy kitten. There was something\n",
      "feline in her lithe, graceful outline. She lay flat and looked up\n",
      "through the pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn't it be great, now,” she murmured, dreamily, half to herself,\n",
      "“if that Las Vegas cowboy would happen somehow to come, and then an\n",
      "earthquake would shut us up here in this Paradise valley so we'd never\n",
      "get out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! What would mother say to such talk as that?” gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Nell, wouldn't it be great?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be terrible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, there never was any romance in you, Nell Rayner,” replied Bo. “That\n",
      "very thing has actually happened out here in this wonderful country\n",
      "of wild places. You need not tell me! Sure it's happened. With the\n",
      "cliff-dwellers and the Indians and then white people. Every place I look\n",
      "makes me feel that. Nell, you'd have to see people in the moon through a\n",
      "telescope before you'd believe that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm practical and sensible, thank goodness!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, for the sake of argument,” protested Bo, with flashing eyes,\n",
      "“suppose it MIGHT happen. Just to please me, suppose we DID get shut up\n",
      "here with Dale and that cowboy we saw from the train. Shut in without\n",
      "any hope of ever climbing out.... What would you do? Would you give up\n",
      "and pine away and die? Or would you fight for life and whatever joy it\n",
      "might mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Self-preservation is the first instinct,” replied Helen, surprised at\n",
      "a strange, deep thrill in the depths of her. “I'd fight for life, of\n",
      "course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Well, really, when I think seriously I don't want anything like\n",
      "that to happen. But, just the same, if it DID happen I would glory in\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were talking Dale returned with the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you bridle an' saddle your own horse?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'm ashamed to say I can't,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Time to learn then. Come on. Watch me first when I saddle mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was all eyes while Dale slipped off the bridle from his horse and\n",
      "then with slow, plain action readjusted it. Next he smoothed the back of\n",
      "the horse, shook out the blanket, and, folding it half over, he threw\n",
      "it in place, being careful to explain to Bo just the right position. He\n",
      "lifted his saddle in a certain way and put that in place, and then he\n",
      "tightened the cinches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you try,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Helen's judgment Bo might have been a Western girl all her\n",
      "days. But Dale shook his head and made her do it over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was better. Of course, the saddle is too heavy for you to sling\n",
      "it up. You can learn that with a light one. Now put the bridle on\n",
      "again. Don't be afraid of your hands. He won't bite. Slip the bit in\n",
      "sideways.... There. Now let's see you mount.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bo got into the saddle Dale continued: “You went up quick an'\n",
      "light, but the wrong way. Watch me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had to mount several times before Dale was satisfied. Then he told\n",
      "her to ride off a little distance. When Bo had gotten out of earshot\n",
      "Dale said to Helen: “She'll take to a horse like a duck takes to water.”\n",
      " Then, mounting, he rode out after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched them trotting and galloping and running the horses round\n",
      "the grassy park, and rather regretted she had not gone with them.\n",
      "Eventually Bo rode back, to dismount and fling herself down, red-cheeked\n",
      "and radiant, with disheveled hair, and curls damp on her temples. How\n",
      "alive she seemed! Helen's senses thrilled with the grace and charm\n",
      "and vitality of this surprising sister, and she was aware of a sheer\n",
      "physical joy in her presence. Bo rested, but she did not rest long. She\n",
      "was soon off to play with Bud. Then she coaxed the tame doe to eat\n",
      "out of her hand. She dragged Helen off for wild flowers, curious and\n",
      "thoughtless by turns. And at length she fell asleep, quickly, in a way\n",
      "that reminded Helen of the childhood now gone forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale called them to dinner about four o'clock, as the sun was reddening\n",
      "the western rampart of the park. Helen wondered where the day had gone.\n",
      "The hours had flown swiftly, serenely, bringing her scarcely a thought\n",
      "of her uncle or dread of her forced detention there or possible\n",
      "discovery by those outlaws supposed to be hunting for her. After\n",
      "she realized the passing of those hours she had an intangible and\n",
      "indescribable feeling of what Dale had meant about dreaming the hours\n",
      "away. The nature of Paradise Park was inimical to the kind of thought\n",
      "that had habitually been hers. She found the new thought absorbing, yet\n",
      "when she tried to name it she found that, after all, she had only felt.\n",
      "At the meal hour she was more than usually quiet. She saw that Dale\n",
      "noticed it and was trying to interest her or distract her attention. He\n",
      "succeeded, but she did not choose to let him see that. She strolled\n",
      "away alone to her seat under the pine. Bo passed her once, and cried,\n",
      "tantalizingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My, Nell, but you're growing romantic!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Never before in Helen's life had the beauty of the evening star seemed\n",
      "so exquisite or the twilight so moving and shadowy or the darkness so\n",
      "charged with loneliness. It was their environment--the accompaniment of\n",
      "wild wolf-mourn, of the murmuring waterfall, of this strange man of the\n",
      "forest and the unfamiliar elements among which he made his home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Next morning, her energy having returned, Helen shared Bo's lesson in\n",
      "bridling and saddling her horse, and in riding. Bo, however, rode so\n",
      "fast and so hard that for Helen to share her company was impossible. And\n",
      "Dale, interested and amused, yet anxious, spent most of his time\n",
      "with Bo. It was thus that Helen rode all over the park alone. She was\n",
      "astonished at its size, when from almost any point it looked so small.\n",
      "The atmosphere deceived her. How clearly she could see! And she began to\n",
      "judge distance by the size of familiar things. A horse, looked at across\n",
      "the longest length of the park, seemed very small indeed. Here and\n",
      "there she rode upon dark, swift, little brooks, exquisitely clear and\n",
      "amber-colored and almost hidden from sight by the long grass. These all\n",
      "ran one way, and united to form a deeper brook that apparently wound\n",
      "under the cliffs at the west end, and plunged to an outlet in narrow\n",
      "clefts. When Dale and Bo came to her once she made inquiry, and she was\n",
      "surprised to learn from Dale that this brook disappeared in a hole in\n",
      "the rocks and had an outlet on the other side of the mountain. Sometime\n",
      "he would take them to the lake it formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Over the mountain?” asked Helen, again remembering that she must regard\n",
      "herself as a fugitive. “Will it be safe to leave our hiding-place? I\n",
      "forget so often why we are here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We would be better hidden over there than here,” replied Dale. “The\n",
      "valley on that side is accessible only from that ridge. An' don't worry\n",
      "about bein' found. I told you Roy Beeman is watchin' Anson an' his gang.\n",
      "Roy will keep between them an' us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was reassured, yet there must always linger in the background of\n",
      "her mind a sense of dread. In spite of this, she determined to make the\n",
      "most of her opportunity. Bo was a stimulus. And so Helen spent the rest\n",
      "of that day riding and tagging after her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day was less hard on Helen. Activity, rest, eating, and\n",
      "sleeping took on a wonderful new meaning to her. She had really never\n",
      "known them as strange joys. She rode, she walked, she climbed a little,\n",
      "she dozed under her pine-tree, she worked helping Dale at camp-fire\n",
      "tasks, and when night came she said she did not know herself. That fact\n",
      "haunted her in vague, deep dreams. Upon awakening she forgot her resolve\n",
      "to study herself. That day passed. And then several more went swiftly\n",
      "before she adapted herself to a situation she had reason to believe\n",
      "might last for weeks and even months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was afternoon that Helen loved best of all the time of the day.\n",
      "The sunrise was fresh, beautiful; the morning was windy, fragrant; the\n",
      "sunset was rosy, glorious; the twilight was sad, changing; and night\n",
      "seemed infinitely sweet with its stars and silence and sleep. But the\n",
      "afternoon, when nothing changed, when all was serene, when time seemed\n",
      "to halt, that was her choice, and her solace.\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon she had camp all to herself. Bo was riding. Dale had\n",
      "climbed the mountain to see if he could find any trace of tracks or see\n",
      "any smoke from camp-fire. Bud was nowhere to be seen, nor any of the\n",
      "other pets. Tom had gone off to some sunny ledge where he could bask in\n",
      "the sun, after the habit of the wilder brothers of his species. Pedro\n",
      "had not been seen for a night and a day, a fact that Helen had noted\n",
      "with concern. However, she had forgotten him, and therefore was the more\n",
      "surprised to see him coming limping into camp on three legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Pedro! You have been fighting. Come here,” she called.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hound did not look guilty. He limped to her and held up his right\n",
      "fore paw. The action was unmistakable. Helen examined the injured member\n",
      "and presently found a piece of what looked like mussel-shell embedded\n",
      "deeply between the toes. The wound was swollen, bloody, and evidently\n",
      "very painful. Pedro whined. Helen had to exert all the strength of her\n",
      "fingers to pull it out. Then Pedro howled. But immediately he showed his\n",
      "gratitude by licking her hand. Helen bathed his paw and bound it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Dale returned she related the incident and, showing the piece of\n",
      "shell, she asked: “Where did that come from? Are there shells in the\n",
      "mountains?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once this country was under the sea,” replied Dale. “I've found things\n",
      "that 'd make you wonder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Under the sea!” ejaculated Helen. It was one thing to have read of\n",
      "such a strange fact, but a vastly different one to realize it here among\n",
      "these lofty peaks. Dale was always showing her something or telling her\n",
      "something that astounded her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here,” he said one day. “What do you make of that little bunch of\n",
      "aspens?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were on the farther side of the park and were resting under a\n",
      "pine-tree. The forest here encroached upon the park with its straggling\n",
      "lines of spruce and groves of aspen. The little clump of aspens did not\n",
      "differ from hundreds Helen had seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't make anything particularly of it,” replied Helen, dubiously.\n",
      "“Just a tiny grove of aspens--some very small, some larger, but none\n",
      "very big. But it's pretty with its green and yellow leaves fluttering\n",
      "and quivering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It doesn't make you think of a fight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fight? No, it certainly does not,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it's as good an example of fight, of strife, of selfishness, as\n",
      "you will find in the forest,” he said. “Now come over, you an' Bo, an'\n",
      "let me show you what I mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, Nell,” cried Bo, with enthusiasm. “He'll open our eyes some\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing loath, Helen went with them to the little clump of aspens.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About a hundred altogether,” said Dale. “They're pretty well shaded by\n",
      "the spruces, but they get the sunlight from east an' south. These little\n",
      "trees all came from the same seedlings. They're all the same age. Four\n",
      "of them stand, say, ten feet or more high an' they're as large around as\n",
      "my wrist. Here's one that's largest. See how full-foliaged he is--how he\n",
      "stands over most of the others, but not so much over these four next to\n",
      "him. They all stand close together, very close, you see. Most of them\n",
      "are no larger than my thumb. Look how few branches they have, an' none\n",
      "low down. Look at how few leaves. Do you see how all the branches stand\n",
      "out toward the east an' south--how the leaves, of course, face the same\n",
      "way? See how one branch of one tree bends aside one from another tree.\n",
      "That's a fight for the sunlight. Here are one--two--three dead trees.\n",
      "Look, I can snap them off. An' now look down under them. Here are little\n",
      "trees five feet high--four feet high--down to these only a foot\n",
      "high. Look how pale, delicate, fragile, unhealthy! They get so little\n",
      "sunshine. They were born with the other trees, but did not get an equal\n",
      "start. Position gives the advantage, perhaps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale led the girls around the little grove, illustrating his words by\n",
      "action. He seemed deeply in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You understand it's a fight for water an' sun. But mostly sun, because,\n",
      "if the leaves can absorb the sun, the tree an' roots will grow to grasp\n",
      "the needed moisture. Shade is death--slow death to the life of trees.\n",
      "These little aspens are fightin' for place in the sunlight. It is a\n",
      "merciless battle. They push an' bend one another's branches aside an'\n",
      "choke them. Only perhaps half of these aspens will survive, to make one\n",
      "of the larger clumps, such as that one of full-grown trees over there.\n",
      "One season will give advantage to this saplin' an' next year to that\n",
      "one. A few seasons' advantage to one assures its dominance over the\n",
      "others. But it is never sure of holdin' that dominance. An 'if wind or\n",
      "storm or a strong-growin' rival does not overthrow it, then sooner or\n",
      "later old age will. For there is absolute and continual fight. What is\n",
      "true of these aspens is true of all the trees in the forest an' of all\n",
      "plant life in the forest. What is most wonderful to me is the tenacity\n",
      "of life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And next day Dale showed them an even more striking example of this\n",
      "mystery of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "He guided them on horseback up one of the thick, verdant-wooded slopes,\n",
      "calling their attention at various times to the different growths, until\n",
      "they emerged on the summit of the ridge where the timber grew scant\n",
      "and dwarfed. At the edge of timber-line he showed a gnarled and knotted\n",
      "spruce-tree, twisted out of all semblance to a beautiful spruce, bent\n",
      "and storm-blasted, with almost bare branches, all reaching one' way. The\n",
      "tree was a specter. It stood alone. It had little green upon it. There\n",
      "seemed something tragic about its contortions. But it was alive and\n",
      "strong. It had no rivals to take sun or moisture. Its enemies were the\n",
      "snow and wind and cold of the heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt, as the realization came to her, the knowledge Dale wished\n",
      "to impart, that it was as sad as wonderful, and as mysterious as it was\n",
      "inspiring. At that moment there were both the sting and sweetness of\n",
      "life--the pain and the joy--in Helen's heart. These strange facts\n",
      "were going to teach her--to transform her. And even if they hurt, she\n",
      "welcomed them.\n",

      "\n",
      "“I'll ride you if it breaks--my neck!” panted Bo, passionately, shaking\n",
      "her gloved fist at the gray pony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood near with a broad smile on his face. Helen was within\n",
      "earshot, watching from the edge of the park, and she felt so fascinated\n",
      "and frightened that she could not call out for Bo to stop. The little\n",
      "gray mustang was a beauty, clean-limbed and racy, with long black mane\n",
      "and tail, and a fine, spirited head. There was a blanket strapped on his\n",
      "back, but no saddle. Bo held the short halter that had been fastened\n",
      "in a hackamore knot round his nose. She wore no coat; her blouse was\n",
      "covered with grass and seeds, and it was open at the neck; her hair hung\n",
      "loose and disheveled; one side of her face bore a stain of grass and\n",
      "dirt and a suspicion of blood; the other was red and white; her eyes\n",
      "blazed; beads of sweat stood out on her brow and wet places shone on her\n",
      "cheeks. As she began to strain on the halter, pulling herself closer\n",
      "to the fiery pony, the outline of her slender shape stood out lithe and\n",
      "strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo had been defeated in her cherished and determined ambition to ride\n",
      "Dale's mustang, and she was furious. The mustang did not appear to be\n",
      "vicious or mean. But he was spirited, tricky, mischievous, and he had\n",
      "thrown her six times. The scene of Bo's defeat was at the edge of the\n",
      "park, where thick moss and grass afforded soft places for her to fall.\n",
      "It also afforded poor foothold for the gray mustang, obviously placing\n",
      "him at a disadvantage. Dale did not bridle him, because he had not been\n",
      "broken to a bridle; and though it was harder for Bo to try to ride him\n",
      "bareback, there was less risk of her being hurt. Bo had begun in all\n",
      "eagerness and enthusiasm, loving and petting the mustang, which she\n",
      "named “Pony.” She had evidently anticipated an adventure, but her\n",
      "smiling, resolute face had denoted confidence. Pony had stood fairly\n",
      "well to be mounted, and then had pitched and tossed until Bo had slid\n",
      "off or been upset or thrown. After each fall Bo bounced up with less of\n",
      "a smile, and more of spirit, until now the Western passion to master a\n",
      "horse had suddenly leaped to life within her. It was no longer fun, no\n",
      "more a daring circus trick to scare Helen and rouse Dale's admiration.\n",
      "The issue now lay between Bo and the mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pony reared, snorting, tossing his head, and pawing with front feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pull him down!” yelled Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo did not have much weight, but she had strength, an she hauled with\n",
      "all her might, finally bringing him down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now hold hard an' take up rope an' get in to him,” called Dale. “Good!\n",
      "You're sure not afraid of him. He sees that. Now hold him, talk to him,\n",
      "tell him you're goin' to ride him. Pet him a little. An' when he quits\n",
      "shakin', grab his mane an' jump up an' slide a leg over him. Then hook\n",
      "your feet under him, hard as you can, an' stick on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If Helen had not been so frightened for Bo she would have been able to\n",
      "enjoy her other sensations. Creeping, cold thrills chased over her as\n",
      "Bo, supple and quick, slid an arm and a leg over Pony and straightened\n",
      "up on him with a defiant cry. Pony jerked his head down, brought his\n",
      "feet together in one jump, and began to bounce. Bo got the swing of him\n",
      "this time and stayed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're ridin' him,” yelled Dale. “Now squeeze hard with your knees.\n",
      "Crack him over the head with your rope.... That's the way. Hang on now\n",
      "an' you'll have him beat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mustang pitched all over the space adjacent to Dale and Helen,\n",
      "tearing up the moss and grass. Several times he tossed Bo high, but she\n",
      "slid back to grip him again with her legs, and he could not throw her.\n",
      "Suddenly he raised his head and bolted. Dale answered Bo's triumphant\n",
      "cry. But Pony had not run fifty feet before he tripped and fell,\n",
      "throwing Bo far over his head. As luck would have it--good luck,\n",
      "Dale afterward said--she landed in a boggy place and the force of her\n",
      "momentum was such that she slid several yards, face down, in wet moss\n",
      "and black ooze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen uttered a scream and ran forward. Bo was getting to her knees when\n",
      "Dale reached her. He helped her up and half led, half carried her out\n",
      "of the boggy place. Bo was not recognizable. From head to foot she was\n",
      "dripping black ooze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Bo! Are you hurt?” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Pp--su--tt! Ough! Whew!” she sputtered. “Hurt? No! Can't you see what I\n",
      "lit in? Dale, the sun-of-a-gun didn't throw me. He fell, and I went over\n",
      "his head.”\n",
      "\n",

      "object that had ever come before her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell Rayner--are you--laughing--at me?” demanded Bo, in most righteous\n",
      "amaze and anger.\n",

      "Dale was laughing, too, but noiselessly, and Bo, being blind for the\n",
      "moment, could not be aware of that. By this time they had reached camp.\n",
      "Helen fell flat and laughed as she had never laughed before. When Helen\n",
      "forgot herself so far as to roll on the ground it was indeed a laughing\n",
      "matter. Dale's big frame shook as he possessed himself of a towel and,\n",
      "wetting it at the spring, began to wipe the mud off Bo's face. But that\n",
      "did not serve. Bo asked to be led to the water, where she knelt and,\n",
      "with splashing, washed out her eyes, and then her face, and then the\n",
      "bedraggled strands of hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That mustang didn't break my neck, but he rooted my face in the mud.\n",

      "towel, now.... Well! Milt Dale, you're laughing!”\n",
      "\n",

      "must be a sight.... Nell, I rode that wild pony--the sun-of-a-gun! I\n",
      "rode him! That's enough for me. YOU try it. Laugh all you want. It was\n",

      "cougar seems human an' dyin' an' wild. We'll saddle up an' ride over\n",
      "there. Maybe Pedro will tree a lion. Bo, if he does will you shoot it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure,” replied Bo, with her mouth full of biscuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was how they came to take a long, slow, steep ride under cover of\n",
      "dense spruce. Helen liked the ride after they got on the heights. But\n",
      "they did not get to any point where she could indulge in her pleasure\n",
      "of gazing afar over the ranges. Dale led up and down, and finally mostly\n",
      "down, until they came out within sight of sparser wooded ridges with\n",
      "parks lying below and streams shining in the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than once Pedro had to be harshly called by Dale. The hound scented\n",
      "game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's an old kill,” said Dale, halting to point at some bleached bones\n",
      "scattered under a spruce. Tufts of grayish-white hair lay strewn around.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was it?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Deer, of course. Killed there an' eaten by a lion. Sometime last fall.\n",
      "See, even the skull is split. But I could not say that the lion did it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen shuddered. She thought of the tame deer down at Dale's camp. How\n",
      "beautiful and graceful, and responsive to kindness!\n",
      "\n",
      "They rode out of the woods into a grassy swale with rocks and clumps of\n",
      "some green bushes bordering it. Here Pedro barked, the first time Helen\n",
      "had heard him. The hair on his neck bristled, and it required stern\n",
      "calls from Dale to hold him in. Dale dismounted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hyar, Pede, you get back,” he ordered. “I'll let you go presently....\n",
      "Girls, you're goin' to see somethin'. But stay on your horses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, with the hound tense and bristling beside him, strode here\n",
      "and there at the edge of the swale. Presently he halted on a slight\n",
      "elevation and beckoned for the girls to ride over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, see where the grass is pressed down all nice an' round,” he said,\n",
      "pointing. “A lion made that. He sneaked there, watchin' for deer. That\n",
      "was done this mornin'. Come on, now. Let's see if we can trail him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stooped now, studying the grass, and holding Pedro. Suddenly he\n",
      "straightened up with a flash in his gray eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here's where he jumped.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Helen could not see any reason why Dale should say that. The man of\n",
      "the forest took a long stride then another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' here's where that lion lit on the back of the deer. It was a big\n",
      "jump. See the sharp hoof tracks of the deer.” Dale pressed aside tall\n",
      "grass to show dark, rough, fresh tracks of a deer, evidently made by\n",
      "violent action.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on,” called Dale, walking swiftly. “You're sure goin' to see\n",
      "somethin' now.... Here's where the deer bounded, carryin' the lion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” exclaimed Bo, incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The deer was runnin' here with the lion on his back. I'll prove it to\n",
      "you. Come on, now. Pedro, you stay with me. Girls, it's a fresh trail.”\n",
      " Dale walked along, leading his horse, and occasionally he pointed down\n",
      "into the grass. “There! See that! That's hair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen did see some tufts of grayish hair scattered on the ground, and\n",
      "she believed she saw little, dark separations in the grass, where an\n",
      "animal had recently passed. All at once Dale halted. When Helen reached\n",
      "him Bo was already there and they were gazing down at a wide, flattened\n",
      "space in the grass. Even Helen's inexperienced eyes could make out\n",
      "evidences of a struggle. Tufts of gray-white hair lay upon the crushed\n",
      "grass. Helen did not need to see any more, but Dale silently pointed to\n",
      "a patch of blood. Then he spoke:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lion brought the deer down here an' killed him. Probably broke his\n",
      "neck. That deer ran a hundred yards with the lion. See, here's the trail\n",
      "left where the lion dragged the deer off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A well-defined path showed across the swale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, you'll see that deer pretty quick,” declared Dale, starting\n",
      "forward. “This work has just been done. Only a few minutes ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you tell?” queried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! See that grass. It has been bent down by the deer bein' dragged\n",
      "over it. Now it's springin' up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's next stop was on the other side of the swale, under a spruce with\n",
      "low, spreading branches. The look of Pedro quickened Helen's pulse.\n",
      "He was wild to give chase. Fearfully Helen looked where Dale pointed,\n",
      "expecting to see the lion. But she saw instead a deer lying prostrate\n",
      "with tongue out and sightless eyes and bloody hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, that lion heard us an' left. He's not far,” said Dale, as he\n",
      "stooped to lift the head of the deer. “Warm! Neck broken. See the lion's\n",
      "teeth an' claw marks.... It's a doe. Look here. Don't be squeamish,\n",
      "girls. This is only an hourly incident of everyday life in the forest.\n",
      "See where the lion has rolled the skin down as neat as I could do it,\n",
      "an' he'd just begun to bite in there when he heard us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What murderous work, The sight sickens me!” exclaimed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is nature,” said Dale, simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's kill the lion,” added Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "For answer Dale took a quick turn at their saddle-girths, and then,\n",
      "mounting, he called to the hound. “Hunt him up, Pedro.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a shot the hound was off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride in my tracks an' keep close to me,” called Dale, as he wheeled his\n",
      "horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We're off!” squealed Bo, in wild delight, and she made her mount\n",
      "plunge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen urged her horse after them and they broke across a corner of the\n",
      "swale to the woods. Pedro was running straight, with his nose high.\n",
      "He let out one short bark. He headed into the woods, with Dale not far\n",
      "behind. Helen was on one of Dale's best horses, but that fact scarcely\n",
      "manifested itself, because the others began to increase their lead. They\n",
      "entered the woods. It was open, and fairly good going. Bo's horse ran as\n",
      "fast in the woods as he did in the open. That frightened Helen and she\n",
      "yelled to Bo to hold him in. She yelled to deaf ears. That was Bo's\n",
      "great risk--she did not intend to be careful. Suddenly the forest rang\n",
      "with Dale's encouraging yell, meant to aid the girls in following him.\n",
      "Helen's horse caught the spirit of the chase. He gained somewhat on\n",
      "Bo, hurdling logs, sometimes two at once. Helen's blood leaped with a\n",
      "strange excitement, utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless. Yet\n",
      "her natural fear, and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish\n",
      "risk of this ride, shared alike in her sum of sensations. She tried to\n",
      "remember Dale's caution about dodging branches and snags, and sliding\n",
      "her knees back to avoid knocks from trees. She barely missed some\n",
      "frightful reaching branches. She received a hard knock, then another,\n",
      "that unseated her, but frantically she held on and slid back, and at the\n",
      "end of a long run through comparatively open forest she got a stinging\n",
      "blow in the face from a far-spreading branch of pine. Bo missed, by what\n",
      "seemed only an inch, a solid snag that would have broken her in two.\n",
      "Both Pedro and Dale got out of Helen's sight. Then Helen, as she began\n",
      "to lose Bo, felt that she would rather run greater risks than be left\n",
      "behind to get lost in the forest, and she urged her horse. Dale's yell\n",
      "pealed back. Then it seemed even more thrilling to follow by sound than\n",
      "by sight. Wind and brush tore at her. The air was heavily pungent with\n",
      "odor of pine. Helen heard a wild, full bay of the hound, ringing back,\n",
      "full of savage eagerness, and she believed Pedro had roused out the lion\n",
      "from some covert. It lent more stir to her blood and it surely urged her\n",
      "horse on faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the swift pace slackened. A windfall of timber delayed Helen. She\n",
      "caught a glimpse of Dale far ahead, climbing a slope. The forest seemed\n",
      "full of his ringing yell. Helen strangely wished for level ground and\n",
      "the former swift motion. Next she saw Bo working down to the right, and\n",
      "Dale's yell now came from that direction. Helen followed, got out of the\n",
      "timber, and made better time on a gradual slope down to another park.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she reached the open she saw Bo almost across this narrow open\n",
      "ground. Here Helen did not need to urge her mount. He snorted and\n",
      "plunged at the level and he got to going so fast that Helen would\n",
      "have screamed aloud in mingled fear and delight if she had not been\n",
      "breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her horse had the bad luck to cross soft ground. He went to his knees\n",
      "and Helen sailed out of the saddle over his head. Soft willows and wet\n",
      "grass broke her fall. She was surprised to find herself unhurt. Up she\n",
      "bounded and certainly did not know this new Helen Rayner. Her horse was\n",
      "coming, and he had patience with her, but he wanted to hurry. Helen made\n",
      "the quickest mount of her experience and somehow felt a pride in it.\n",
      "She would tell Bo that. But just then Bo flashed into the woods out of\n",
      "sight. Helen fairly charged into that green foliage, breaking brush and\n",
      "branches. She broke through into open forest. Bo was inside, riding down\n",
      "an aisle between pines and spruces. At that juncture Helen heard Dale's\n",
      "melodious yell near at hand. Coming into still more open forest, with\n",
      "rocks here and there, she saw Dale dismounted under a pine, and Pedro\n",
      "standing with fore paws upon the tree-trunk, and then high up on a\n",
      "branch a huge tawny colored lion, just like Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's horse slowed up and showed fear, but he kept on as far as Dale's\n",
      "horse. But Helen's refused to go any nearer. She had difficulty in\n",
      "halting him. Presently she dismounted and, throwing her bridle over a\n",
      "stump, she ran on, panting and fearful, yet tingling all over, up to her\n",
      "sister and Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, you did pretty good for a tenderfoot,” was Bo's greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a fine chase,” said Dale. “You both rode well. I wish you could\n",
      "have seen the lion on the ground. He bounded--great long bounds with\n",
      "his tail up in the air--very funny. An' Pedro almost caught up with him.\n",
      "That scared me, because he would have killed the hound. Pedro was close\n",
      "to him when he treed. An' there he is--the yellow deer-killer. He's a\n",
      "male an' full grown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that Dale pulled his rifle from its saddle-sheath and looked\n",
      "expectantly at Bo. But she was gazing with great interest and admiration\n",
      "up at the lion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn't he just beautiful?” she burst out. “Oh, look at him spit! Just\n",
      "like a cat! Dale, he looks afraid he might fall off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He sure does. Lions are never sure of their balance in a tree. But I\n",
      "never saw one make a misstep. He knows he doesn't belong there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen the lion looked splendid perched up there. He was long and\n",
      "round and graceful and tawny. His tongue hung out and his plump sides\n",
      "heaved, showing what a quick, hard run he had been driven to. What\n",
      "struck Helen most forcibly about him was something in his face as he\n",
      "looked down at the hound. He was scared. He realized his peril. It was\n",
      "not possible for Helen to watch him killed, yet she could not bring\n",
      "herself to beg Bo not to shoot. Helen confessed she was a tenderfoot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get down, Bo, an' let's see how good a shot you are, said Dale. Bo\n",
      "slowly withdrew her fascinated gaze from the lion and looked with a\n",
      "rueful smile at Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've changed my mind. I said I would kill him, but now I can't. He\n",
      "looks so--so different from what I'd imagined.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's answer was a rare smile of understanding and approval that warmed\n",
      "Helen's heart toward him. All the same, he was amused. Sheathing the\n",
      "gun, he mounted his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, Pedro,” he called. “Come, I tell you,” he added, sharply,\n",
      "“Well, girls, we treed him, anyhow, an' it was fun. Now we'll ride back\n",
      "to the deer he killed an' pack a haunch to camp for our own use.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will the lion go back to his--his kill, I think you called it?” asked\n",
      "Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've chased one away from his kill half a dozen times. Lions are not\n",
      "plentiful here an' they don't get overfed. I reckon the balance is\n",
      "pretty even.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This last remark made Helen inquisitive. And as they slowly rode on the\n",
      "back-trail Dale talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You girls, bein' tender-hearted an' not knowin' the life of the forest,\n",
      "what's good an' what's bad, think it was a pity the poor deer was\n",
      "killed by a murderous lion. But you're wrong. As I told you, the lion is\n",
      "absolutely necessary to the health an' joy of wild life--or deer's wild\n",
      "life, so to speak. When deer were created or came into existence,\n",
      "then the lion must have come, too. They can't live without each other.\n",
      "Wolves, now, are not particularly deer-killers. They live off elk an'\n",
      "anythin' they can catch. So will lions, for that matter. But I mean\n",
      "lions follow the deer to an' fro from winter to summer feedin'-grounds.\n",
      "Where there's no deer you will find no lions. Well, now, if left alone\n",
      "deer would multiply very fast. In a few years there would be hundreds\n",
      "where now there's only one. An' in time, as the generations passed,\n",
      "they'd lose the fear, the alertness, the speed an' strength, the\n",
      "eternal vigilance that is love of life--they'd lose that an' begin\n",
      "to deteriorate, an' disease would carry them off. I saw one season of\n",
      "black-tongue among deer. It killed them off, an' I believe that is one\n",
      "of the diseases of over-production. The lions, now, are forever on the\n",
      "trail of the deer. They have learned. Wariness is an instinct born in\n",
      "the fawn. It makes him keen, quick, active, fearful, an' so he grows up\n",
      "strong an' healthy to become the smooth, sleek, beautiful, soft-eyed,\n",
      "an' wild-lookin' deer you girls love to watch. But if it wasn't for\n",
      "the lions, the deer would not thrive. Only the strongest an' swiftest\n",
      "survive. That is the meanin' of nature. There is always a perfect\n",
      "balance kept by nature. It may vary in different years, but on the\n",
      "whole, in the long years, it averages an even balance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How wonderfully you put it!” exclaimed Bo, with all her impulsiveness.\n",
      "“Oh, I'm glad I didn't kill the lion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What you say somehow hurts me,” said Helen, wistfully, to the hunter.\n",
      "“I see--I feel how true--how inevitable it is. But it changes my--my\n",
      "feelings. Almost I'd rather not acquire such knowledge as yours. This\n",
      "balance of nature--how tragic--how sad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why?” asked Dale. “You love birds, an' birds are the greatest\n",
      "killers in the forest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't tell me that--don't prove it,” implored Helen. “It is not so much\n",
      "the love of life in a deer or any creature, and the terrible clinging to\n",
      "life, that gives me distress. It is suffering. I can't bear to see pain.\n",
      "I can STAND pain myself, but I can't BEAR to see or think of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” replied. Dale, thoughtfully, “There you stump me again. I've\n",
      "lived long in the forest an' when a man's alone he does a heap of\n",
      "thinkin'. An' always I couldn't understand a reason or a meanin'\n",
      "for pain. Of all the bafflin' things of life, that is the hardest to\n",
      "understand an' to forgive--pain!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That evening, as they sat in restful places round the camp-fire, with\n",
      "the still twilight fading into night, Dale seriously asked the girls\n",
      "what the day's chase had meant to them. His manner of asking was\n",
      "productive of thought. Both girls were silent for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Glorious!” was Bo's brief and eloquent reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” asked. Dale, curiously. “You are a girl. You've been used to\n",
      "home, people, love, comfort, safety, quiet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe that is just why it was glorious,” said Bo, earnestly. “I can\n",
      "hardly explain. I loved the motion of the horse, the feel of wind in\n",
      "my face, the smell of the pine, the sight of slope and forest glade and\n",
      "windfall and rocks, and the black shade under the spruces. My blood\n",
      "beat and burned. My teeth clicked. My nerves all quivered. My heart\n",
      "sometimes, at dangerous moments, almost choked me, and all the time it\n",
      "pounded hard. Now my skin was hot and then it was cold. But I think the\n",
      "best of that chase for me was that I was on a fast horse, guiding him,\n",
      "controlling him. He was alive. Oh, how I felt his running!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what you say is as natural to me as if I felt it,” said Dale. “I\n",
      "wondered. You're certainly full of fire, An', Helen, what do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo has answered you with her feelings,” replied Helen, “I could not do\n",
      "that and be honest. The fact that Bo wouldn't shoot the lion after we\n",
      "treed him acquits her. Nevertheless, her answer is purely physical. You\n",
      "know, Mr. Dale, how you talk about the physical. I should say my sister\n",
      "was just a young, wild, highly sensitive, hot-blooded female of the\n",
      "species. She exulted in that chase as an Indian. Her sensations were\n",
      "inherited ones--certainly not acquired by education. Bo always hated\n",
      "study. The ride was a revelation to me. I had a good many of Bo's\n",
      "feelings--though not so strong. But over against them was the opposition\n",
      "of reason, of consciousness. A new-born side of my nature confronted me,\n",
      "strange, surprising, violent, irresistible. It was as if another side of\n",
      "my personality suddenly said: 'Here I am. Reckon with me now!' And there\n",
      "was no use for the moment to oppose that strange side. I--the thinking\n",
      "Helen Rayner, was powerless. Oh yes, I had such thoughts even when the\n",
      "branches were stinging my face and I was thrilling to the bay of the\n",
      "hound. Once my horse fell and threw me.... You needn't look alarmed.\n",
      "It was fine. I went into a soft place and was unhurt. But when I was\n",
      "sailing through the air a thought flashed: this is the end of me! It was\n",
      "like a dream when you are falling dreadfully. Much of what I felt and\n",
      "thought on that chase must have been because of what I have studied and\n",
      "read and taught. The reality of it, the action and flash, were splendid.\n",
      "But fear of danger, pity for the chased lion, consciousness of foolish\n",
      "risk, of a reckless disregard for the serious responsibility I have\n",
      "taken--all these worked in my mind and held back what might have been a\n",
      "sheer physical, primitive joy of the wild moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale listened intently, and after Helen had finished he studied the fire\n",
      "and thoughtfully poked the red embers with his stick. His face was still\n",
      "and serene, untroubled and unlined, but to Helen his eyes seemed sad,\n",
      "pensive, expressive of an unsatisfied yearning and wonder. She had\n",
      "carefully and earnestly spoken, because she was very curious to hear\n",
      "what he might say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand you,” he replied, presently. “An' I'm sure surprised that\n",
      "I can. I've read my books--an' reread them, but no one ever talked like\n",
      "that to me. What I make of it is this. You've the same blood in you\n",
      "that's in Bo. An' blood is stronger than brain. Remember that blood is\n",
      "life. It would be good for you to have it run an' beat an' burn, as\n",
      "Bo's did. Your blood did that a thousand years or ten thousand before\n",
      "intellect was born in your ancestors. Instinct may not be greater than\n",
      "reason, but it's a million years older. Don't fight your instincts so\n",
      "hard. If they were not good the God of Creation would not have given\n",
      "them to you. To-day your mind was full of self-restraint that did not\n",
      "altogether restrain. You couldn't forget yourself. You couldn't FEEL\n",
      "only, as Bo did. You couldn't be true to your real nature.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't agree with you,” replied Helen, quickly. “I don't have to be an\n",
      "Indian to be true to myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, yes you do,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I couldn't be an Indian,” declared Helen, spiritedly. “I couldn't\n",
      "FEEL only, as you say Bo did. I couldn't go back in the scale, as you\n",
      "hint. What would all my education amount to--though goodness knows it's\n",
      "little enough--if I had no control over primitive feelings that happened\n",
      "to be born in me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll have little or no control over them when the right time comes,”\n",
      " replied Dale. “Your sheltered life an' education have led you away from\n",
      "natural instincts. But they're in you an' you'll learn the proof of that\n",
      "out here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Not if I lived a hundred years in the West,” asserted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, child, do you know what you're talkin' about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Bo let out a blissful peal of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Dale!” exclaimed Helen, almost affronted. She was stirred. “I know\n",
      "MYSELF, at least.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you do not. You've no idea of yourself. You've education, yes, but\n",
      "not in nature an' life. An' after all, they are the real things. Answer\n",
      "me, now--honestly, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, if I can. Some of your questions are hard to answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever been starved?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever been lost away from home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever faced death--real stark an' naked death, close an'\n",
      "terrible?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you ever wanted to kill any one with your bare hands?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Dale, you--you amaze me. No!... No!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I know your answer to my last question, but I'll ask it,\n",
      "anyhow.... Have you ever been so madly in love with a man that you could\n",
      "not live without him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo fell off her seat with a high, trilling laugh. “Oh, you two are\n",
      "great!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank Heaven, I haven't been,” replied Helen, shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you don't know anythin' about life,” declared Dale, with finality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was not to be put down by that, dubious and troubled as it made\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you experienced all those things?” she queried, stubbornly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All but the last one. Love never came my way. How could it? I live\n",
      "alone. I seldom go to the villages where there are girls. No girl would\n",
      "ever care for me. I have nothin'.... But, all the same, I understand\n",
      "love a little, just by comparison with strong feelin's I've lived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched the hunter and marveled at his simplicity. His sad and\n",
      "penetrating gaze was on the fire, as if in its white heart to read the\n",
      "secret denied him. He had said that no girl would ever love him. She\n",
      "imagined he might know considerably less about the nature of girls than\n",
      "of the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To come back to myself,” said Helen, wanting to continue the argument.\n",
      "“You declared I didn't know myself. That I would have no self-control. I\n",
      "will!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I meant the big things of life,” he said, patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What things?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you. By askin' what had never happened to you I learned what\n",
      "will happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those experiences to come to ME!” breathed Helen, incredulously.\n",
      "“Never!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sister Nell, they sure will--particularly the last-named one--the mad\n",
      "love,” chimed in Bo, mischievously, yet believingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Dale nor Helen appeared to hear her interruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me put it simpler,” began Dale, evidently racking his brain for\n",
      "analogy. His perplexity appeared painful to him, because he had a great\n",
      "faith, a great conviction that he could not make clear. “Here I am,\n",
      "the natural physical man, livin' in the wilds. An' here you come, the\n",
      "complex, intellectual woman. Remember, for my argument's sake, that\n",
      "you're here. An' suppose circumstances forced you to stay here. You'd\n",
      "fight the elements with me an' work with me to sustain life. There\n",
      "must be a great change in either you or me, accordin' to the other's\n",
      "influence. An' can't you see that change must come in you, not because\n",
      "of anythin' superior in me--I'm really inferior to you--but because of\n",
      "our environment? You'd lose your complexity. An' in years to come you'd\n",
      "be a natural physical woman, because you'd live through an' by the\n",
      "physical.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh dear, will not education be of help to the Western woman?” queried\n",
      "Helen, almost in despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure it will,” answered Dale, promptly. “What the West needs is women\n",
      "who can raise an' teach children. But you don't understand me. You don't\n",
      "get under your skin. I reckon I can't make you see my argument as I feel\n",
      "it. You take my word for this, though. Sooner or later you WILL wake up\n",
      "an' forget yourself. Remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll bet you do, too,” said Bo, seriously for her. “It may seem\n",
      "strange to you, but I understand Dale. I feel what he means. It's a sort\n",
      "of shock. Nell, we're not what we seem. We're not what we fondly imagine\n",
      "we are. We've lived too long with people--too far away from the earth.\n",
      "You know the Bible says something like this: 'Dust thou art and to dust\n",
      "thou shalt return.' Where DO we come from?”\n",

      "CHAPTER XII\n",
      "\n",
      "Days passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every morning Helen awoke with a wondering question as to what this\n",
      "day would bring forth, especially with regard to possible news from her\n",
      "uncle. It must come sometime and she was anxious for it. Something about\n",
      "this simple, wild camp life had begun to grip her. She found herself\n",
      "shirking daily attention to the clothes she had brought West. They\n",
      "needed it, but she had begun to see how superficial they really were.\n",
      "On the other hand, camp-fire tasks had come to be a pleasure. She had\n",
      "learned a great deal more about them than had Bo. Worry and dread\n",
      "were always impinging upon the fringe of her thoughts--always vaguely\n",
      "present, though seldom annoying. They were like shadows in dreams. She\n",
      "wanted to get to her uncle's ranch, to take up the duties of her new\n",
      "life. But she was not prepared to believe she would not regret this wild\n",
      "experience. She must get away from that in order to see it clearly, and\n",
      "she began to have doubts of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the active and restful outdoor life went on. Bo leaned more\n",
      "and more toward utter reconciliation to it. Her eyes had a wonderful\n",
      "flash, like blue lightning; her cheeks were gold and brown; her hands\n",
      "tanned dark as an Indian's.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could vault upon the gray mustang, or, for that matter, clear over\n",
      "his back. She learned to shoot a rifle accurately enough to win Dale's\n",
      "praise, and vowed she would like to draw a bead upon a grizzly bear or\n",
      "upon Snake Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, if you met that grizzly Dale said has been prowling round camp\n",
      "lately you'd run right up a tree,” declared Helen, one morning, when Bo\n",
      "seemed particularly boastful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't fool yourself,” retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I've seen you run from a mouse!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sister, couldn't I be afraid of a mouse and not a bear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't see how.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, bears, lions, outlaws, and other wild beasts are to be met with\n",
      "here in the West, and my mind's made up,” said Bo, in slow-nodding\n",
      "deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "They argued as they had always argued, Helen for reason and common sense\n",
      "and restraint, Bo on the principle that if she must fight it was better\n",
      "to get in the first blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning on which this argument took place Dale was a long time in\n",
      "catching the horses. When he did come in he shook his head seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some varmint's been chasin' the horses,” he said, as he reached for his\n",
      "saddle. “Did you hear them snortin' an' runnin' last night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of the girls had been awakened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I missed one of the colts,” went on Dale, “an' I'm goin' to ride across\n",
      "the park.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's movements were quick and stern. It was significant that he chose\n",
      "his heavier rifle, and, mounting, with a sharp call to Pedro, he rode\n",
      "off without another word to the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo watched him for a moment and then began to saddle the mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't follow him?” asked Helen, quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sure will,” replied Bo. “He didn't forbid it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he certainly did not want us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might not want you, but I'll bet he wouldn't object to me,\n",
      "whatever's up,” said Bo, shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So you think--” exclaimed Helen, keenly hurt. She bit her tongue to\n",
      "keep back a hot reply. And it was certain that a bursting gush of anger\n",
      "flooded over her. Was she, then, such a coward? Did Dale think this\n",
      "slip of a sister, so wild and wilful, was a stronger woman than she? A\n",
      "moment's silent strife convinced her that no doubt he thought so and\n",
      "no doubt he was right. Then the anger centered upon herself, and Helen\n",
      "neither understood nor trusted herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome proved an uncontrollable impulse. Helen began to saddle her\n",
      "horse. She had the task half accomplished when Bo's call made her look\n",
      "up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen heard a ringing, wild bay of the hound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's Pedro,” she said, with a thrill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. He's running. We never heard him bay like that before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Dale?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He rode out of sight across there,” replied Bo, pointing. “And Pedro's\n",
      "running toward us along that slope. He must be a mile--two miles from\n",
      "Dale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Dale will follow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. But he'd need wings to get near that hound now. Pedro couldn't\n",
      "have gone across there with him... just listen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wild note of the hound manifestly stirred Bo to irrepressible\n",
      "action. Snatching up Dale's lighter rifle, she shoved it into her\n",
      "saddle-sheath, and, leaping on the mustang, she ran him over brush and\n",
      "brook, straight down the park toward the place Pedro was climbing. For\n",
      "an instant Helen stood amazed beyond speech. When Bo sailed over a big\n",
      "log, like a steeple-chaser, then Helen answered to further unconsidered\n",
      "impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened. Without coat or hat\n",
      "she mounted. The nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the\n",
      "saddle. A strange, trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins.\n",
      "She wanted to scream for Bo to wait. Bo was out of sight, but the deep,\n",
      "muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded\n",
      "Helen an easy trail to follow. In fact, her horse needed no guiding. He\n",
      "ran in and out of the straggling spruces along the edge of the park, and\n",
      "suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang\n",
      "standing still. Bo was looking up and listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There he is!” cried Bo, as the hound bayed ringingly, closer to them\n",
      "this time, and she spurred away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's horse followed without urging. He was excited. His ears were up.\n",
      "Something was in the wind. Helen had never ridden along this broken end\n",
      "of the park, and Bo was not easy to keep up with. She led across bogs,\n",
      "brooks, swales, rocky little ridges, through stretches of timber and\n",
      "groves of aspen so thick Helen could scarcely squeeze through. Then\n",
      "Bo came out into a large open offshoot of the park, right under the\n",
      "mountain slope, and here she sat, her horse watching and listening.\n",
      "Helen rode up to her, imagining once that she had heard the hound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! Look!” Bo's scream made her mustang stand almost straight up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed up to see a big brown bear with a frosted coat go lumbering\n",
      "across an opening on the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a grizzly! He'll kill Pedro! Oh, where is Dale!” cried Bo, with\n",
      "intense excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! That bear is running down! We--we must get--out of his road,”\n",
      " panted Helen, in breathless alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale hasn't had time to be close.... Oh, I wish he'd come! I don't know\n",
      "what to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride back. At least wait for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then Pedro spoke differently, in savage barks, and following that\n",
      "came a loud growl and crashings in the brush. These sounds appeared to\n",
      "be not far up the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! Do you hear? Pedro's fighting the bear,” burst out Bo. Her face\n",
      "paled, her eyes flashed like blue steel. “The bear 'll kill him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, that would be dreadful!” replied Helen, in distress. “But what on\n",
      "earth can we do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“HEL-LO, DALE!” called Bo, at the highest pitch of her piercing voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "No answer came. A heavy crash of brush, a rolling of stones, another\n",
      "growl from the slope told Helen that the hound had brought the bear to\n",
      "bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm going up,” said Bo, deliberately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No-no! Are you mad?” returned Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bear will kill Pedro.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might kill you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ride that way and yell for Dale,” rejoined Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What will--you do?” gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll shoot at the bear--scare him off. If he chases me he can't catch\n",
      "me coming downhill. Dale said that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're crazy!” cried Helen, as Bo looked up the slope, searching for\n",
      "open ground. Then she pulled the rifle from its sheath.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bo did not hear or did not care. She spurred the mustang, and he,\n",
      "wild to run, flung grass and dirt from his heels. What Helen would have\n",
      "done then she never knew, but the fact was that her horse bolted after\n",
      "the mustang. In an instant, seemingly, Bo had disappeared in the gold\n",
      "and green of the forest slope. Helen's mount climbed on a run, snorting\n",
      "and heaving, through aspens, brush, and timber, to come out into a\n",
      "narrow, long opening extending lengthwise up the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden prolonged crash ahead alarmed Helen and halted her horse. She\n",
      "saw a shaking of aspens. Then a huge brown beast leaped as a cat out of\n",
      "the woods. It was a bear of enormous size. Helen's heart stopped--her\n",
      "tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. The bear turned. His mouth was\n",
      "open, red and dripping. He looked shaggy, gray. He let out a terrible\n",
      "bawl. Helen's every muscle froze stiff. Her horse plunged high and\n",
      "sidewise, wheeling almost in the air, neighing his terror. Like a stone\n",
      "she dropped from the saddle. She did not see the horse break into the\n",
      "woods, but she heard him. Her gaze never left the bear even while she\n",
      "was falling, and it seemed she alighted in an upright position with her\n",
      "back against a bush. It upheld her. The bear wagged his huge head from\n",
      "side to side. Then, as the hound barked close at hand, he turned to run\n",
      "heavily uphill and out of the opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant of his disappearance was one of collapse for Helen. Frozen\n",
      "with horror, she had been unable to move or feel or think. All at once\n",
      "she was a quivering mass of cold, helpless flesh, wet with perspiration,\n",
      "sick with a shuddering, retching, internal convulsion, her mind\n",
      "liberated from paralyzing shock. The moment was as horrible as that\n",
      "in which the bear had bawled his frightful rage. A stark, icy, black\n",
      "emotion seemed in possession of her. She could not lift a hand, yet all\n",
      "of her body appeared shaking. There was a fluttering, a strangling in\n",
      "her throat. The crushing weight that surrounded her heart eased before\n",
      "she recovered use of her limbs. Then, the naked and terrible thing was\n",
      "gone, like a nightmare giving way to consciousness. What blessed relief!\n",
      "Helen wildly gazed about her. The bear and hound were out of sight, and\n",
      "so was her horse. She stood up very dizzy and weak. Thought of Bo then\n",
      "seemed to revive her, to shock different life and feeling throughout all\n",
      "her cold extremities. She listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard a thudding of hoofs down the slope, then Dale's clear, strong\n",
      "call. She answered. It appeared long before he burst out of the woods,\n",
      "riding hard and leading her horse. In that time she recovered fully,\n",
      "and when he reached her, to put a sudden halt upon the fiery Ranger, she\n",
      "caught the bridle he threw and swiftly mounted her horse. The feel of\n",
      "the saddle seemed different. Dale's piercing gray glance thrilled her\n",
      "strangely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're white. Are you hurt?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I was scared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he threw you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, he certainly threw me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What happened?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We heard the hound and we rode along the timber. Then we saw the\n",
      "bear--a monster--white--coated--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know. It's a grizzly. He killed the colt--your pet. Hurry now. What\n",
      "about Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pedro was fighting the bear. Bo said he'd be killed. She rode right up\n",
      "here. My horse followed. I couldn't have stopped him. But we lost Bo.\n",
      "Right there the bear came out. He roared. My horse threw me and ran off.\n",
      "Pedro's barking saved me--my life, I think. Oh! that was awful! Then the\n",
      "bear went up--there.... And you came.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo's followin' the hound!” ejaculated Dale. And, lifting his hands to\n",
      "his mouth, he sent out a stentorian yell that rolled up the slope, rang\n",
      "against the cliffs, pealed and broke and died away. Then he waited,\n",
      "listening. From far up the slope came a faint, wild cry, high-pitched\n",
      "and sweet, to create strange echoes, floating away to die in the\n",
      "ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's after him!” declared Dale, grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo's got your rifle,” said Helen. “Oh, we must hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You go back,” ordered Dale, wheeling his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” Helen felt that word leave her lips with the force of a bullet.\n",

      "Dale spurred Ranger and took to the open slope. Helen kept at his heels\n",
      "until timber was reached. Here a steep trail led up. Dale dismounted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Horse tracks--bear tracks--dog tracks,” he said, bending over. “We'll\n",
      "have to walk up here. It'll save our horses an' maybe time, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Bo riding up there?” asked Helen, eying the steep ascent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She sure is.” With that Dale started up, leading his horse. Helen\n",
      "followed. It was rough and hard work. She was lightly clad, yet soon she\n",
      "was hot, laboring, and her heart began to hurt. When Dale halted to\n",
      "rest Helen was just ready to drop. The baying of the hound, though\n",
      "infrequent, inspirited her. But presently that sound was lost. Dale said\n",
      "bear and hound had gone over the ridge and as soon as the top was gained\n",
      "he would hear them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look there,” he said, presently, pointing to fresh tracks, larger than\n",
      "those made by Bo's mustang. “Elk tracks. We've scared a big bull an'\n",
      "he's right ahead of us. Look sharp an' you'll see him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen never climbed so hard and fast before, and when they reached the\n",
      "ridge-top she was all tuckered out. It was all she could do to get on\n",
      "her horse. Dale led along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the\n",
      "western end, which was considerably higher. In places open rocky ground\n",
      "split the green timber. Dale pointed toward a promontory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen saw a splendid elk silhouetted against the sky. He was a light\n",
      "gray over all his hindquarters, with shoulders and head black. His\n",
      "ponderous, wide-spread antlers towered over him, adding to the wildness\n",
      "of his magnificent poise as he stood there, looking down into the\n",
      "valley, no doubt listening for the bay of the hound. When he heard\n",
      "Dale's horse he gave one bound, gracefully and wonderfully carrying his\n",
      "antlers, to disappear in the green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again on a bare patch of ground Dale pointed down. Helen saw big round\n",
      "tracks, toeing in a little, that gave her a chill. She knew these were\n",
      "grizzly tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard riding was not possible on this ridge crest, a fact that gave Helen\n",
      "time to catch her breath. At length, coming out upon the very summit\n",
      "of the mountain, Dale heard the hound. Helen's eyes feasted afar upon\n",
      "a wild scene of rugged grandeur, before she looked down on this western\n",
      "slope at her feet to see bare, gradual descent, leading down to sparsely\n",
      "wooded bench and on to deep-green canuon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride hard now!” yelled Dale. “I see Bo, an' I'll have to ride to catch\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale spurred down the slope. Helen rode in his tracks and, though she\n",
      "plunged so fast that she felt her hair stand up with fright, she saw him\n",
      "draw away from her. Sometimes her horse slid on his haunches for a\n",
      "few yards, and at these hazardous moments she got her feet out of the\n",
      "stirrups so as to fall free from him if he went down. She let him choose\n",
      "the way, while she gazed ahead at Dale, and then farther on, in the hope\n",
      "of seeing Bo. At last she was rewarded. Far Down the wooded bench she\n",
      "saw a gray flash of the little mustang and a bright glint of Bo's hair.\n",
      "Her heart swelled. Dale would soon overhaul Bo and come between her and\n",
      "peril. And on the instant, though Helen was unconscious of it then,\n",
      "a remarkable change came over her spirit. Fear left her. And a hot,\n",
      "exalting, incomprehensible something took possession of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She let the horse run, and when he had plunged to the foot of that slope\n",
      "of soft ground he broke out across the open bench at a pace that made\n",
      "the wind bite Helen's cheeks and roar in her ears. She lost sight of\n",
      "Dale. It gave her a strange, grim exultance. She bent her eager gaze to\n",
      "find the tracks of his horse, and she found them. Also she made out the\n",
      "tracks of Bo's mustang and the bear and the hound. Her horse, scenting\n",
      "game, perhaps, and afraid to be left alone, settled into a fleet and\n",
      "powerful stride, sailing over logs and brush. That open bench had looked\n",
      "short, but it was long, and Helen rode down the gradual descent at\n",
      "breakneck speed. She would not be left behind. She had awakened to a\n",
      "heedlessness of risk. Something burned steadily within her. A grim, hard\n",
      "anger of joy! When she saw, far down another open, gradual descent, that\n",
      "Dale had passed Bo and that Bo was riding the little mustang as never\n",
      "before, then Helen flamed with a madness to catch her, to beat her in\n",
      "that wonderful chase, to show her and Dale what there really was in the\n",
      "depths of Helen Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ambition was to be short-lived, she divined from the lay of the land\n",
      "ahead, but the ride she lived then for a flying mile was something that\n",
      "would always blanch her cheeks and prick her skin in remembrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The open ground was only too short. That thundering pace soon brought\n",
      "Helen's horse to the timber. Here it took all her strength to check his\n",
      "headlong flight over deadfalls and between small jack-pines. Helen lost\n",
      "sight of Bo, and she realized it would take all her wits to keep from\n",
      "getting lost. She had to follow the trail, and in some places it was\n",
      "hard to see from horseback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, her horse was mettlesome, thoroughly aroused, and he wanted a\n",
      "free rein and his own way. Helen tried that, only to lose the trail and\n",
      "to get sundry knocks from trees and branches. She could not hear the\n",
      "hound, nor Dale. The pines were small, close together, and tough. They\n",
      "were hard to bend. Helen hurt her hands, scratched her face, barked her\n",
      "knees. The horse formed a habit suddenly of deciding to go the way he\n",
      "liked instead of the way Helen guided him, and when he plunged between\n",
      "saplings too close to permit easy passage it was exceedingly hard on\n",
      "her. That did not make any difference to Helen. Once worked into a\n",
      "frenzy, her blood stayed at high pressure. She did not argue with\n",
      "herself about a need of desperate hurry. Even a blow on the head that\n",
      "nearly blinded her did not in the least retard her. The horse could\n",
      "hardly be held, and not at all in the few open places.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last Helen reached another slope. Coming out upon canuon rim, she\n",
      "heard Dale's clear call, far down, and Bo's answering peal, high and\n",
      "piercing, with its note of exultant wildness. Helen also heard the bear\n",
      "and the hound fighting at the bottom of this canuon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Helen again missed the tracks made by Dale and Bo. The descent\n",
      "looked impassable. She rode back along the rim, then forward. Finally\n",
      "she found where the ground had been plowed deep by hoofs, down over\n",
      "little banks. Helen's horse balked at these jumps. When she goaded him\n",
      "over them she went forward on his neck. It seemed like riding straight\n",
      "downhill. The mad spirit of that chase grew more stingingly keen to\n",
      "Helen as the obstacles grew. Then, once more the bay of the hound and\n",
      "the bawl of the bear made a demon of her horse. He snorted a shrill\n",
      "defiance. He plunged with fore hoofs in the air. He slid and broke a way\n",
      "down the steep, soft banks, through the thick brush and thick clusters\n",
      "of saplings, sending loose rocks and earth into avalanches ahead of him.\n",
      "He fell over one bank, but a thicket of aspens upheld him so that he\n",
      "rebounded and gained his feet. The sounds of fight ceased, but Dale's\n",
      "thrilling call floated up on the pine-scented air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Helen realized it she was at the foot of the slope, in a narrow\n",
      "canuon-bed, full of rocks and trees, with a soft roar of running water\n",
      "filling her ears. Tracks were everywhere, and when she came to the first\n",
      "open place she saw where the grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into\n",
      "the water. Here he had fought Pedro. Signs of that battle were easy to\n",
      "read. Helen saw where his huge tracks, still wet, led up the opposite\n",
      "sandy bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then down-stream Helen did some more reckless and splendid riding. On\n",
      "level ground the horse was great. Once he leaped clear across the brook.\n",
      "Every plunge, every turn Helen expected to come upon Dale and Bo facing\n",
      "the bear. The canuon narrowed, the stream-bed deepened. She had to slow\n",
      "down to get through the trees and rocks. Quite unexpectedly she rode\n",
      "pell-mell upon Dale and Bo and the panting Pedro. Her horse plunged to a\n",
      "halt, answering the shrill neighs of the other horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale gazed in admiring amazement at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, did you meet the bear again?” he queried, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Didn't--you--kill him?” panted Helen, slowly sagging in her saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He got away in the rocks. Rough country down here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen slid off her horse and fell with a little panting cry of relief.\n",
      "She saw that she was bloody, dirty, disheveled, and wringing wet with\n",
      "perspiration. Her riding habit was torn into tatters. Every muscle\n",
      "seemed to burn and sting, and all her bones seemed broken. But it was\n",
      "worth all this to meet Dale's penetrating glance, to see Bo's utter,\n",
      "incredulous astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell--Rayner!” gasped Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If--my horse 'd been--any good--in the woods,” panted Helen, “I'd not\n",
      "lost--so much time--riding down this mountain. And I'd caught you--beat\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girl, did you RIDE down this last slope?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sure did,” replied Helen, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We walked every step of the way, and was lucky to get down at that,”\n",
      " responded Dale, gravely. “No horse should have been ridden down there.\n",
      "Why, he must have slid down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We slid--yes. But I stayed on him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's incredulity changed to wondering, speechless admiration. And Dale's\n",
      "rare smile changed his gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm sorry. It was rash of me. I thought you'd go back.... But all's\n",
      "well that ends well.... Helen, did you wake up to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She dropped her eyes, not caring to meet the questioning gaze upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe--a little,” she replied, and she covered her face with her hands.\n",
      "Remembrance of his questions--of his assurance that she did not know\n",
      "the real meaning of life--of her stubborn antagonism--made her somehow\n",
      "ashamed. But it was not for long.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The chase was great,” she said. “I did not know myself. You were\n",
      "right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In how many ways did you find me right?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think all--but one,” she replied, with a laugh and a shudder. “I'm\n",
      "near starved NOW--I was so furious at Bo that I could have choked her. I\n",
      "faced that horrible brute.... Oh, I know what it is to fear death!... I\n",
      "was lost twice on the ride--absolutely lost. That's all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo found her tongue. “The last thing was for you to fall wildly in love,\n",
      "wasn't it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“According to Dale, I must add that to my new experiences of\n",
      "to-day--before I can know real life,” replied Helen, demurely.\n",

      "After more days of riding the grassy level of that wonderfully gold\n",
      "and purple park, and dreamily listening by day to the ever-low and\n",
      "ever-changing murmur of the waterfall, and by night to the wild, lonely\n",
      "mourn of a hunting wolf, and climbing to the dizzy heights where the\n",
      "wind stung sweetly, Helen Rayner lost track of time and forgot her\n",
      "peril.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Beeman did not return. If occasionally Dale mentioned Roy and his\n",
      "quest, the girls had little to say beyond a recurrent anxiety for the\n",
      "old uncle, and then they forgot again. Paradise Park, lived in a little\n",
      "while at that season of the year, would have claimed any one, and ever\n",
      "afterward haunted sleeping or waking dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo gave up to the wild life, to the horses and rides, to the many pets,\n",
      "and especially to the cougar, Tom. The big cat followed her everywhere,\n",
      "played with her, rolling and pawing, kitten-like, and he would lay\n",
      "his massive head in her lap to purr his content. Bo had little fear of\n",
      "anything, and here in the wilds she soon lost that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another of Dale's pets was a half-grown black bear named Muss. He was\n",
      "abnormally jealous of little Bud and he had a well-developed hatred\n",
      "of Tom, otherwise he was a very good-tempered bear, and enjoyed Dale's\n",
      "impartial regard. Tom, however, chased Muss out of camp whenever Dale's\n",
      "back was turned, and sometimes Muss stayed away, shifting for himself.\n",
      "With the advent of Bo, who spent a good deal of time on the animals,\n",
      "Muss manifestly found the camp more attractive. Whereupon, Dale\n",
      "predicted trouble between Tom and Muss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo liked nothing better than a rough-and-tumble frolic with the black\n",
      "bear. Muss was not very big nor very heavy, and in a wrestling bout with\n",
      "the strong and wiry girl he sometimes came out second best. It spoke\n",
      "well of him that he seemed to be careful not to hurt Bo. He never bit\n",
      "or scratched, though he sometimes gave her sounding slaps with his paws.\n",
      "Whereupon, Bo would clench her gauntleted fists and sail into him in\n",
      "earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "One afternoon before the early supper they always had, Dale and Helen\n",
      "were watching Bo teasing the bear. She was in her most vixenish mood,\n",
      "full of life and fight. Tom lay his long length on the grass, watching\n",
      "with narrow, gleaming eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bo and Muss locked in an embrace and went down to roll over and\n",
      "over, Dale called Helen's attention to the cougar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom's jealous. It's strange how animals are like people. Pretty soon\n",
      "I'll have to corral Muss, or there'll be a fight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could not see anything wrong with Tom except that he did not look\n",
      "playful.\n",
      "\n",
      "During supper-time both bear and cougar disappeared, though this was not\n",
      "remarked until afterward. Dale whistled and called, but the rival pets\n",
      "did not return. Next morning Tom was there, curled up snugly at the foot\n",
      "of Bo's bed, and when she arose he followed her around as usual. But\n",
      "Muss did not return.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstance made Dale anxious. He left camp, taking Tom with him,\n",
      "and upon returning stated that he had followed Muss's track as far as\n",
      "possible, and then had tried to put Tom on the trail, but the cougar\n",
      "would not or could not follow it. Dale said Tom never liked a bear\n",
      "trail, anyway, cougars and bears being common enemies. So, whether by\n",
      "accident or design, Bo lost one of her playmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter searched some of the slopes next day and even went up on one\n",
      "of the mountains. He did not discover any sign of Muss, but he said he\n",
      "had found something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo you girls want some more real excitement?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "speeches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't mind bein' good an' scared?” he went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can't scare me,” bantered Bo. But Helen looked doubtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up in one of the parks I ran across one of my horses--a lame bay you\n",
      "haven't seen. Well, he had been killed by that old silvertip. The one we\n",
      "chased. Hadn't been dead over an hour. Blood was still runnin' an' only\n",
      "a little meat eaten. That bear heard me or saw me an' made off into the\n",
      "woods. But he'll come back to-night. I'm goin' up there, lay for him,\n",
      "an' kill him this time. Reckon you'd better go, because I don't want to\n",
      "leave you here alone at night.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "When they had hurried supper, and Dale had gotten in the horses, the sun\n",
      "had set and the valley was shadowing low down, while the ramparts were\n",
      "still golden. The long zigzag trail Dale followed up the slope took\n",
      "nearly an hour to climb, so that when that was surmounted and he led\n",
      "out of the woods twilight had fallen. A rolling park extended as far as\n",
      "Helen could see, bordered by forest that in places sent out straggling\n",
      "stretches of trees. Here and there, like islands, were isolated patches\n",
      "of timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "At ten thousand feet elevation the twilight of this clear and cold night\n",
      "was a rich and rare atmospheric effect. It looked as if it was seen\n",
      "through perfectly clear smoked glass. Objects were singularly visible,\n",
      "even at long range, and seemed magnified. In the west, where the\n",
      "afterglow of sunset lingered over the dark, ragged, spruce-speared\n",
      "horizon-line, there was such a transparent golden line melting into\n",
      "vivid star-fired blue that Helen could only gaze and gaze in wondering\n",
      "admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale spurred his horse into a lope and the spirited mounts of the girls\n",
      "kept up with him. The ground was rough, with tufts of grass growing\n",
      "close together, yet the horses did not stumble. Their action and\n",
      "snorting betrayed excitement. Dale led around several clumps of timber,\n",
      "up a long grassy swale, and then straight westward across an open flat\n",
      "toward where the dark-fringed forest-line raised itself wild and clear\n",
      "against the cold sky. The horses went swiftly, and the wind cut like a\n",
      "blade of ice. Helen could barely get her breath and she panted as if she\n",
      "had just climbed a laborsome hill. The stars began to blink out of the\n",
      "blue, and the gold paled somewhat, and yet twilight lingered. It seemed\n",
      "long across that flat, but really was short. Coming to a thin line of\n",
      "trees that led down over a slope to a deeper but still isolated patch\n",
      "of woods, Dale dismounted and tied his horse. When the girls got off he\n",
      "haltered their horses also.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stick close to me an' put your feet down easy,” he whispered. How tall\n",
      "and dark he loomed in the fading light! Helen thrilled, as she had often\n",
      "of late, at the strange, potential force of the man. Stepping softly,\n",
      "without the least sound, Dale entered this straggly bit of woods, which\n",
      "appeared to have narrow byways and nooks. Then presently he came to\n",
      "the top of a well-wooded slope, dark as pitch, apparently. But as Helen\n",
      "followed she perceived the trees, and they were thin dwarf spruce,\n",
      "partly dead. The slope was soft and springy, easy to step upon without\n",
      "noise. Dale went so cautiously that Helen could not hear him, and\n",
      "sometimes in the gloom she could not see him. Then the chill thrills ran\n",
      "over her. Bo kept holding on to Helen, which fact hampered Helen as\n",
      "well as worked somewhat to disprove Bo's boast. At last level ground was\n",
      "reached. Helen made out a light-gray background crossed by black bars.\n",
      "Another glance showed this to be the dark tree-trunks against the open\n",
      "park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale halted, and with a touch brought Helen to a straining pause. He was\n",
      "listening. It seemed wonderful to watch him bend his head and stand as\n",
      "silent and motionless as one of the dark trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's not there yet,” Dale whispered, and he stepped forward very\n",
      "slowly. Helen and Bo began to come up against thin dead branches that\n",
      "were invisible and then cracked. Then Dale knelt down, seemed to melt\n",
      "into the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll have to crawl,” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "How strange and thrilling that was for Helen, and hard work! The ground\n",
      "bore twigs and dead branches, which had to be carefully crawled over;\n",
      "and lying flat, as was necessary, it took prodigious effort to drag her\n",
      "body inch by inch. Like a huge snake, Dale wormed his way along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradually the wood lightened. They were nearing the edge of the park.\n",
      "Helen now saw a strip of open with a high, black wall of spruce beyond.\n",
      "The afterglow flashed or changed, like a dimming northern light, and\n",
      "then failed. Dale crawled on farther to halt at length between two\n",
      "tree-trunks at the edge of the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come up beside me,” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen crawled on, and presently Bo was beside her panting, with pale\n",
      "face and great, staring eyes, plain to be seen in the wan light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Moon's comin' up. We're just in time. The old grizzly's not there yet,\n",
      "but I see coyotes. Look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale pointed across the open neck of park to a dim blurred patch\n",
      "standing apart some little distance from the black wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's the dead horse,” whispered Dale. “An' if you watch close you can\n",
      "see the coyotes. They're gray an' they move.... Can't you hear them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's excited ears, so full of throbs and imaginings, presently\n",
      "registered low snaps and snarls. Bo gave her arm a squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hear them. They're fighting. Oh, gee!” she panted, and drew a long,\n",
      "full breath of unutterable excitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep quiet now an' watch an' listen,” said the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly the black, ragged forest-line seemed to grow blacker and lift;\n",
      "slowly the gray neck of park lightened under some invisible influence;\n",
      "slowly the stars paled and the sky filled over. Somewhere the moon was\n",
      "rising. And slowly that vague blurred patch grew a little clearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the tips of the spruce, now seen to be rather close at hand,\n",
      "shone a slender, silver crescent moon, darkening, hiding, shining again,\n",
      "climbing until its exquisite sickle-point topped the trees, and then,\n",
      "magically, it cleared them, radiant and cold. While the eastern black\n",
      "wall shaded still blacker, the park blanched and the border-line\n",
      "opposite began to stand out as trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look! Look!” cried Bo, very low and fearfully, as she pointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not so loud,” whispered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I see something!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep quiet,” he admonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen, in the direction Bo pointed, could not see anything but\n",
      "moon-blanched bare ground, rising close at hand to a little ridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lie still,” whispered Dale. “I'm goin' to crawl around to get a look\n",
      "from another angle. I'll be right back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved noiselessly backward and disappeared. With him gone, Helen felt\n",
      "a palpitating of her heart and a prickling of her skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my! Nell! Look!” whispered Bo, in fright. “I know I saw something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the little ridge a round object moved slowly, getting farther\n",
      "out into the light. Helen watched with suspended breath. It moved out\n",
      "to be silhouetted against the sky--apparently a huge, round, bristling\n",
      "animal, frosty in color. One instant it seemed huge--the next\n",
      "small--then close at hand--and far away. It swerved to come directly\n",
      "toward them. Suddenly Helen realized that the beast was not a dozen\n",
      "yards distant. She was just beginning a new experience--a real\n",
      "and horrifying terror in which her blood curdled, her heart gave a\n",
      "tremendous leap and then stood still, and she wanted to fly, but was\n",
      "rooted to the spot--when Dale returned to her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's a pesky porcupine,” he whispered. “Almost crawled over you. He\n",
      "sure would have stuck you full of quills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon he threw a stick at the animal. It bounced straight up to turn\n",
      "round with startling quickness, and it gave forth a rattling sound; then\n",
      "it crawled out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Por--cu--pine!” whispered Bo, pantingly. “It might--as well--have\n",
      "been--an elephant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen uttered a long, eloquent sigh. She would not have cared to\n",
      "describe her emotions at sight of a harmless hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen!” warned Dale, very low. His big hand closed over Helen's\n",
      "gauntleted one. “There you have--the real cry of the wild.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharp and cold on the night air split the cry of a wolf, distant, yet\n",
      "wonderfully distinct. How wild and mournful and hungry! How marvelously\n",
      "pure! Helen shuddered through all her frame with the thrill of its\n",
      "music, the wild and unutterable and deep emotions it aroused. Again\n",
      "a sound of this forest had pierced beyond her life, back into the dim\n",
      "remote past from which she had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cry was not repeated. The coyotes were still. And silence fell,\n",
      "absolutely unbroken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale nudged Helen, and then reached over to give Bo a tap. He was\n",
      "peering keenly ahead and his strained intensity could be felt. Helen\n",
      "looked with all her might and she saw the shadowy gray forms of the\n",
      "coyotes skulk away, out of the moonlight into the gloom of the woods,\n",
      "where they disappeared. Not only Dale's intensity, but the very silence,\n",
      "the wildness of the moment and place, seemed fraught with wonderful\n",
      "potency. Bo must have felt it, too, for she was trembling all over, and\n",
      "holding tightly to Helen, and breathing quick and fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” muttered Dale, under his breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen caught the relief and certainty in his exclamation, and she\n",
      "divined, then, something of what the moment must have been to a hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then her roving, alert glance was arrested by a looming gray shadow\n",
      "coming out of the forest. It moved, but surely that huge thing could not\n",
      "be a bear. It passed out of gloom into silver moonlight. Helen's heart\n",
      "bounded. For it was a great frosty-coated bear lumbering along toward\n",
      "the dead horse. Instinctively Helen's hand sought the arm of the hunter.\n",
      "It felt like iron under a rippling surface. The touch eased away the\n",
      "oppression over her lungs, the tightness of her throat. What must have\n",
      "been fear left her, and only a powerful excitement remained. A sharp\n",
      "expulsion of breath from Bo and a violent jerk of her frame were signs\n",
      "that she had sighted the grizzly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the moonlight he looked of immense size, and that wild park with\n",
      "the gloomy blackness of forest furnished a fit setting for him. Helen's\n",
      "quick mind, so taken up with emotion, still had a thought for the wonder\n",
      "and the meaning of that scene. She wanted the bear killed, yet that\n",
      "seemed a pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a wagging, rolling, slow walk which took several moments to reach\n",
      "his quarry. When at length he reached it he walked around with sniffs\n",
      "plainly heard and then a cross growl. Evidently he had discovered that\n",
      "his meal had been messed over. As a whole the big bear could be seen\n",
      "distinctly, but only in outline and color. The distance was perhaps two\n",
      "hundred yards. Then it looked as if he had begun to tug at the carcass.\n",
      "Indeed, he was dragging it, very slowly, but surely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look at that!” whispered Dale. “If he ain't strong!... Reckon I'll have\n",
      "to stop him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The grizzly, however, stopped of his own accord, just outside of the\n",
      "shadow-line of the forest. Then he hunched in a big frosty heap over his\n",
      "prey and began to tear and rend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jess was a mighty good horse,” muttered Dale, grimly; “too good to make\n",
      "a meal for a hog silvertip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the hunter silently rose to a kneeling position, swinging the\n",
      "rifle in front of him. He glanced up into the low branches of the tree\n",
      "overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girls, there's no tellin' what a grizzly will do. If I yell, you climb\n",
      "up in this tree, an' do it quick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he leveled the rifle, resting his left elbow on his knee. The\n",
      "front end of the rifle, reaching out of the shade, shone silver in the\n",
      "moonlight. Man and weapon became still as stone. Helen held her breath.\n",
      "But Dale relaxed, lowering the barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can't see the sights very well,” he whispered, shaking his head.\n",
      "“Remember, now--if I yell you climb!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he aimed and slowly grew rigid. Helen could not take her\n",
      "fascinated eyes off him. He knelt, bareheaded, and in the shadow she\n",
      "could make out the gleam of his clear-cut profile, stern and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "A streak of fire and a heavy report startled her. Then she heard the\n",
      "bullet hit. Shifting her glance, she saw the bear lurch with convulsive\n",
      "action, rearing on his hind legs. Loud clicking snaps must have been a\n",
      "clashing of his jaws in rage. But there was no other sound. Then again\n",
      "Dale's heavy gun boomed. Helen heard again that singular spatting thud\n",
      "of striking lead. The bear went down with a flop as if he had been dealt\n",
      "a terrific blow. But just as quickly he was up on all-fours and began\n",
      "to whirl with hoarse, savage bawls of agony and fury. His action quickly\n",
      "carried him out of the moonlight into the shadow, where he disappeared.\n",
      "There the bawls gave place to gnashing snarls, and crashings in the\n",
      "brush, and snapping of branches, as he made his way into the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure he's mad,” said Dale, rising to his feet. “An' I reckon hard hit.\n",
      "But I won't follow him to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the girls got up, and Helen found she was shaky on her feet and\n",
      "very cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh-h, wasn't--it--won-wonder-ful!” cried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you scared? Your teeth are chatterin',” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm--cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it sure is cold, all right,” he responded. “Now the fun's over,\n",
      "you'll feel it.... Nell, you're froze, too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen nodded. She was, indeed, as cold as she had ever been before. But\n",
      "that did not prevent a strange warmness along her veins and a quickened\n",
      "pulse, the cause of which she did not conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's rustle,” said Dale, and led the way out of the wood and skirted\n",
      "its edge around to the slope. There they climbed to the flat, and went\n",
      "through the straggling line of trees to where the horses were tethered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up here the wind began to blow, not hard through the forest, but still\n",
      "strong and steady out in the open, and bitterly cold. Dale helped Bo to\n",
      "mount, and then Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm--numb,” she said. “I'll fall off--sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. You'll be warm in a jiffy,” he replied, “because we'll ride some\n",
      "goin' back. Let Ranger pick the way an' you hang on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With Ranger's first jump Helen's blood began to run. Out he shot, his\n",
      "lean, dark head beside Dale's horse. The wild park lay clear and bright\n",
      "in the moonlight, with strange, silvery radiance on the grass. The\n",
      "patches of timber, like spired black islands in a moon-blanched lake,\n",
      "seemed to harbor shadows, and places for bears to hide, ready to spring\n",
      "out. As Helen neared each little grove her pulses shook and her heart\n",
      "beat. Half a mile of rapid riding burned out the cold. And all seemed\n",
      "glorious--the sailing moon, white in a dark-blue sky, the white,\n",
      "passionless stars, so solemn, so far away, the beckoning fringe of\n",
      "forest-land at once mysterious and friendly, and the fleet horses,\n",
      "running with soft, rhythmic thuds over the grass, leaping the ditches\n",
      "and the hollows, making the bitter wind sting and cut. Coming up\n",
      "that park the ride had been long; going back was as short as it was\n",
      "thrilling. In Helen, experiences gathered realization slowly, and it\n",
      "was this swift ride, the horses neck and neck, and all the wildness and\n",
      "beauty, that completed the slow, insidious work of years. The tears\n",
      "of excitement froze on her cheeks and her heart heaved full. All that\n",
      "pertained to this night got into her blood. It was only to feel, to live\n",
      "now, but it could be understood and remembered forever afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's horse, a little in advance, sailed over a ditch. Ranger made a\n",
      "splendid leap, but he alighted among some grassy tufts and fell. Helen\n",
      "shot over his head. She struck lengthwise, her arms stretched, and slid\n",
      "hard to a shocking impact that stunned her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's scream rang in her ears; she felt the wet grass under her face and\n",
      "then the strong hands that lifted her. Dale loomed over her, bending\n",
      "down to look into her face; Bo was clutching her with frantic hands. And\n",
      "Helen could only gasp. Her breast seemed caved in. The need to breathe\n",
      "was torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!--you're not hurt. You fell light, like a feather. All grass\n",
      "here.... You can't be hurt!” said Dale, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "His anxious voice penetrated beyond her hearing, and his strong hands\n",
      "went swiftly over her arms and shoulders, feeling for broken bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just had the wind knocked out of you,” went on Dale. “It feels awful,\n",
      "but it's nothin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen got a little air, that was like hot pin-points in her lungs, and\n",
      "then a deeper breath, and then full, gasping respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I guess--I'm not hurt--not a bit,” she choked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You sure had a header. Never saw a prettier spill. Ranger doesn't do\n",
      "that often. I reckon we were travelin' too fast. But it was fun, don't\n",
      "you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Bo who answered. “Oh, glorious!... But, gee! I was scared.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale still held Helen's hands. She released them while looking up at\n",
      "him. The moment was realization for her of what for days had been a\n",
      "vague, sweet uncertainty, becoming near and strange, disturbing and\n",
      "present. This accident had been a sudden, violent end to the wonderful\n",
      "ride. But its effect, the knowledge of what had got into her blood,\n",
      "would never change. And inseparable from it was this man of the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n",
      "\n",
      "On the next morning Helen was awakened by what she imagined had been a\n",
      "dream of some one shouting. With a start she sat up. The sunshine showed\n",
      "pink and gold on the ragged spruce line of the mountain rims. Bo was on\n",
      "her knees, braiding her hair with shaking hands, and at the same time\n",
      "trying to peep out.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the echoes of a ringing cry were cracking back from the cliffs. That\n",
      "had been Dale's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! Nell! Wake up!” called Bo, wildly. “Oh, some one's come! Horses\n",
      "and men!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen got to her knees and peered out over Bo's shoulder. Dale, standing\n",
      "tall and striking beside the campfire, was waving his sombrero. Away\n",
      "down the open edge of the park came a string of pack-burros with mounted\n",
      "men behind. In the foremost rider Helen recognized Roy Beeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That first one's Roy!” she exclaimed. “I'd never forget him on a\n",
      "horse.... Bo, it must mean Uncle Al's come!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure! We're born lucky. Here we are safe and sound--and all this grand\n",
      "camp trip.... Look at the cowboys.... LOOK! Oh, maybe this isn't great!”\n",
      " babbled Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale wheeled to see the girls peeping out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's time you're up!” he called. “Your uncle Al is here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant after Helen sank back out of Dale's sight she sat there\n",
      "perfectly motionless, so struck was she by the singular tone of Dale's\n",
      "voice. She imagined that he regretted what this visiting cavalcade of\n",
      "horsemen meant--they had come to take her to her ranch in Pine. Helen's\n",
      "heart suddenly began to beat fast, but thickly, as if muffled within her\n",
      "breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hurry now, girls,” called Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was already out, kneeling on the flat stone at the little brook,\n",
      "splashing water in a great hurry. Helen's hands trembled so that she\n",
      "could scarcely lace her boots or brush her hair, and she was long behind\n",
      "Bo in making herself presentable. When Helen stepped out, a short,\n",
      "powerfully built man in coarse garb and heavy boots stood holding Bo's\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, wal! You favor the Rayners,” he was saying, “I remember your dad,\n",
      "an' a fine feller he was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside them stood Dale and Roy, and beyond was a group of horses and\n",
      "riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle, here comes Nell,” said Bo, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” The old cattle-man breathed hard as he turned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen hurried. She had not expected to remember this uncle, but one look\n",
      "into the brown, beaming face, with the blue eyes flashing, yet sad, and\n",
      "she recognized him, at the same instant recalling her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "He held out his arms to receive her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell Auchincloss all over again!” he exclaimed, in deep voice, as he\n",
      "kissed her. “I'd have knowed you anywhere!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al!” murmured Helen. “I remember you--though I was only four.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, wal,--that's fine,” he replied. “I remember you straddled my knee\n",
      "once, an' your hair was brighter--an' curly. It ain't neither now....\n",
      "Sixteen years! An' you're twenty now? What a fine, broad-shouldered girl\n",
      "you are! An', Nell, you're the handsomest Auchincloss I ever seen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen found herself blushing, and withdrew her hands from his as Roy\n",
      "stepped forward to pay his respects. He stood bareheaded, lean and tall,\n",
      "with neither his clear eyes nor his still face, nor the proffered hand\n",
      "expressing anything of the proven quality of fidelity, of achievement,\n",
      "that Helen sensed in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Miss Helen? Howdy, Bo?” he said. “You all both look fine an'\n",
      "brown.... I reckon I was shore slow rustlin' your uncle Al up here. But\n",
      "I was figgerin' you'd like Milt's camp for a while.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We sure did,” replied Bo, archly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” breathed Auchincloss, heavily. “Lemme set down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew the girls to the rustic seat Dale had built for them under the\n",
      "big pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you must be tired! How--how are you?” asked Helen, anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tired! Wal, if I am it's jest this here minit. When Joe Beeman rode\n",
      "in on me with thet news of you--wal, I jest fergot I was a worn-out old\n",
      "hoss. Haven't felt so good in years. Mebbe two such young an' pretty\n",
      "nieces will make a new man of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al, you look strong and well to me,” said Bo. “And young, too,\n",
      "and--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! Thet 'll do,” interrupted Al. “I see through you. What you'll\n",
      "do to Uncle Al will be aplenty.... Yes, girls, I'm feelin' fine. But\n",
      "strange--strange! Mebbe thet's my joy at seein' you safe--safe when I\n",
      "feared so thet damned greaser Beasley--”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Helen's grave gaze his face changed swiftly--and all the serried\n",
      "years of toil and battle and privation showed, with something that was\n",
      "not age, nor resignation, yet as tragic as both.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, never mind him--now,” he added, slowly, and the warmer light\n",
      "returned to his face. “Dale--come here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter stepped closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I owe you more 'n I can ever pay,” said Auchincloss, with an\n",
      "arm around each niece.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Al, you don't owe me anythin',” returned Dale, thoughtfully, as he\n",
      "looked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh!” grunted Al. “You hear him, girls.... Now listen, you wild\n",
      "hunter. An' you girls listen.... Milt, I never thought you much good,\n",
      "'cept for the wilds. But I reckon I'll have to swallow thet. I do.\n",
      "Comin' to me as you did--an' after bein' druv off--keepin' your council\n",
      "an' savin' my girls from thet hold-up, wal, it's the biggest deal any\n",
      "man ever did for me.... An' I'm ashamed of my hard feelin's, an' here's\n",
      "my hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks, Al,” replied Dale, with his fleeting smile, and he met the\n",
      "proffered hand. “Now, will you be makin' camp here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, no. I'll rest a little, an' you can pack the girls' outfit--then\n",
      "we'll go. Sure you're goin' with us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll call the girls to breakfast,” replied Dale, and he moved away\n",
      "without answering Auchincloss's query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen divined that Dale did not mean to go down to Pine with them, and\n",
      "the knowledge gave her a blank feeling of surprise. Had she expected him\n",
      "to go?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come here, Jeff,” called Al, to one of his men.\n",
      "\n",
      "A short, bow-legged horseman with dusty garb and sun-bleached face\n",
      "hobbled forth from the group. He was not young, but he had a boyish grin\n",
      "and bright little eyes. Awkwardly he doffed his slouch sombrero.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jeff, shake hands with my nieces,” said Al. “This 's Helen, an' your\n",
      "boss from now on. An' this 's Bo, fer short. Her name was Nancy, but\n",
      "when she lay a baby in her cradle I called her Bo-Peep, an' the name's\n",
      "stuck.... Girls, this here's my foreman, Jeff Mulvey, who's been with me\n",
      "twenty years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction caused embarrassment to all three principals,\n",
      "particularly to Jeff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jeff, throw the packs an' saddles fer a rest,” was Al's order to his\n",
      "foreman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, reckon you'll have fun bossin' thet outfit,” chuckled Al. “None\n",
      "of 'em's got a wife. Lot of scalawags they are; no women would have\n",
      "them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle, I hope I'll never have to be their boss,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you're goin' to be, right off,” declared Al. “They ain't a bad\n",
      "lot, after all. An' I got a likely new man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he turned to Bo, and, after studying her pretty face,\n",
      "he asked, in apparently severe tone, “Did you send a cowboy named\n",
      "Carmichael to ask me for a job?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo looked quite startled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael! Why, Uncle, I never heard that name before,” replied Bo,\n",
      "bewilderedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Reckoned the young rascal was lyin',” said Auchincloss. “But I\n",
      "liked the fellar's looks an' so let him stay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the rancher turned to the group of lounging riders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, come here,” he ordered, in a loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen thrilled at sight of a tall, superbly built cowboy reluctantly\n",
      "detaching himself from the group. He had a red-bronze face, young like a\n",
      "boy's. Helen recognized it, and the flowing red scarf, and the swinging\n",
      "gun, and the slow, spur-clinking gait. No other than Bo's Las Vegas\n",
      "cowboy admirer!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen flashed a look at Bo, which look gave her a delicious,\n",
      "almost irresistible desire to laugh. That young lady also recognized the\n",
      "reluctant individual approaching with flushed and downcast face. Helen\n",
      "recorded her first experience of Bo's utter discomfiture. Bo turned\n",
      "white then red as a rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, my niece said she never heard of the name Carmichael,” declared\n",
      "Al, severely, as the cowboy halted before him. Helen knew her uncle had\n",
      "the repute of dealing hard with his men, but here she was reassured and\n",
      "pleased at the twinkle in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, boss, I can't help thet,” drawled the cowboy. “It's good old\n",
      "Texas stock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not appear shamefaced now, but just as cool, easy, clear-eyed,\n",
      "and lazy as the day Helen had liked his warm young face and intent gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Texas! You fellars from the Pan Handle are always hollerin' Texas.\n",
      "I never seen thet Texans had any one else beat--say from Missouri,”\n",
      " returned Al, testily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael maintained a discreet silence, and carefully avoided looking\n",
      "at the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, reckon we'll all call you Las Vegas, anyway,” continued the\n",
      "rancher. “Didn't you say my niece sent you to me for a job?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Carmichael's easy manner vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, boss, shore my memory's pore,” he said. “I only says--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't tell me thet. My memory's not p-o-r-e,” replied Al, mimicking\n",
      "the drawl. “What you said was thet my niece would speak a good word for\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Carmichael stole a timid glance at Bo, the result of which was\n",
      "to render him utterly crestfallen. Not improbably he had taken Bo's\n",
      "expression to mean something it did not, for Helen read it as a mingling\n",
      "of consternation and fright. Her eyes were big and blazing; a red spot\n",
      "was growing in each cheek as she gathered strength from his confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, didn't you?” demanded Al.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the glance the old rancher shot from the cowboy to the others of\n",
      "his employ it seemed to Helen that they were having fun at Carmichael's\n",
      "expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I did,” suddenly replied the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! All right, here's my niece. Now see thet she speaks the good\n",
      "word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael looked at Bo and Bo looked at him. Their glances were\n",
      "strange, wondering, and they grew shy. Bo dropped hers. The cowboy\n",
      "apparently forgot what had been demanded of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen put a hand on the old rancher's arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle, what happened was my fault,” she said. “The train stopped at Las\n",
      "Vegas. This young man saw us at the open window. He must have guessed we\n",
      "were lonely, homesick girls, getting lost in the West. For he spoke to\n",
      "us--nice and friendly. He knew of you. And he asked, in what I took\n",
      "for fun, if we thought you would give him a job. And I replied, just to\n",
      "tease Bo, that she would surely speak a good word for him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! So thet's it,” replied Al, and he turned to Bo with merry\n",
      "eyes. “Wal, I kept this here Las Vegas Carmichael on his say-so. Come on\n",
      "with your good word, unless you want to see him lose his job.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo did not grasp her uncle's bantering, because she was seriously gazing\n",
      "at the cowboy. But she had grasped something.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He--he was the first person--out West--to speak kindly to us,” she\n",
      "said, facing her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet's a pretty good word, but it ain't enough,” responded Al.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subdued laughter came from the listening group. Carmichael shifted from\n",
      "side to side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He--he looks as if he might ride a horse well,” ventured Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Best hossman I ever seen,” agreed Al, heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And--and shoot?” added Bo, hopefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, he packs thet gun low, like Jim Wilson an' all them Texas\n",
      "gun-fighters. Reckon thet ain't no good word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then--I'll vouch for him,” said Bo, with finality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet settles it.” Auchincloss turned to the cowboy. “Las Vegas, you're\n",
      "a stranger to us. But you're welcome to a place in the outfit an' I hope\n",
      "you won't never disappoint us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss's tone, passing from jest to earnest, betrayed to Helen the\n",
      "old rancher's need of new and true men, and hinted of trying days to\n",
      "come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael stood before Bo, sombrero in hand, rolling it round and\n",
      "round, manifestly bursting with words he could not speak. And the girl\n",
      "looked very young and sweet with her flushed face and shining eyes.\n",
      "Helen saw in the moment more than that little by-play of confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss--Miss Rayner--I shore--am obliged,” he stammered, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're very welcome,” she replied, softly. “I--I got on the next\n",
      "train,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he said that Bo was looking straight at him, but she seemed not to\n",
      "have heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's your name?” suddenly she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard that. But didn't uncle call you Las Vegas?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. But it wasn't my fault. Thet cow-punchin' outfit saddled it on\n",
      "me, right off. They Don't know no better. Shore I jest won't answer to\n",
      "thet handle.... Now--Miss Bo--my real name is Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I simply could not call you--any name but Las Vegas,” replied Bo, very\n",
      "sweetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But--beggin' your pardon--I--I don't like thet,” blustered Carmichael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People often get called names--they don't like,” she said, with deep\n",
      "intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy blushed scarlet. Helen as well as he got Bo's inference to\n",
      "that last audacious epithet he had boldly called out as the train was\n",
      "leaving Las Vegas. She also sensed something of the disaster in store\n",
      "for Mr. Carmichael. Just then the embarrassed young man was saved by\n",
      "Dale's call to the girls to come to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "That meal, the last for Helen in Paradise Park, gave rise to a strange\n",
      "and inexplicable restraint. She had little to say. Bo was in the highest\n",
      "spirits, teasing the pets, joking with her uncle and Roy, and even\n",
      "poking fun at Dale. The hunter seemed somewhat somber. Roy was his usual\n",
      "dry, genial self. And Auchincloss, who sat near by, was an interested\n",
      "spectator. When Tom put in an appearance, lounging with his feline grace\n",
      "into the camp, as if he knew he was a privileged pet, the rancher could\n",
      "scarcely contain himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, it's thet damn cougar!” he ejaculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, that's Tom.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He ought to be corralled or chained. I've no use for cougars,”\n",
      " protested Al.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom is as tame an' safe as a kitten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Wal, you tell thet to the girls if you like. But not me! I'm an\n",
      "old hoss, I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al, Tom sleeps curled up at the foot of my bed,” said Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw--what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Honest Injun,” she responded. “Well, isn't it so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen smilingly nodded her corroboration. Then Bo called Tom to her and\n",
      "made him lie with his head on his stretched paws, right beside her, and\n",
      "beg for bits to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal! I'd never have believed thet!” exclaimed Al, shaking his big head.\n",
      "“Dale, it's one on me. I've had them big cats foller me on the trails,\n",
      "through the woods, moonlight an' dark. An' I've heard 'em let out thet\n",
      "awful cry. They ain't any wild sound on earth thet can beat a cougar's.\n",
      "Does this Tom ever let out one of them wails?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes at night,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, excuse me. Hope you don't fetch the yaller rascal down to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What'll you do with this menagerie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale regarded the rancher attentively. “Reckon, Al, I'll take care of\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you're goin' down to my ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Al scratched his head and gazed perplexedly at the hunter. “Wal, ain't\n",
      "it customary to visit friends?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thanks, Al. Next time I ride down Pine way--in the spring,\n",
      "perhaps--I'll run over an' see how you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spring!” ejaculated Auchincloss. Then he shook his head sadly and a\n",
      "far-away look filmed his eyes. “Reckon you'd call some late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, you'll get well now. These, girls--now--they'll cure you. Reckon I\n",
      "never saw you look so good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss did not press his point farther at that time, but after the\n",
      "meal, when the other men came to see Dale's camp and pets, Helen's quick\n",
      "ears caught the renewal of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm askin' you--will you come?” Auchincloss said, low and eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I wouldn't fit in down there,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, talk sense. You can't go on forever huntin' bear an' tamin'\n",
      "cats,” protested the old rancher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” asked the hunter, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss stood up and, shaking himself as if to ward off his testy\n",
      "temper, he put a hand on Dale's arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One reason is you're needed in Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How? Who needs me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do. I'm playin' out fast. An' Beasley's my enemy. The ranch an' all I\n",
      "got will go to Nell. Thet ranch will have to be run by a man an' HELD\n",
      "by a man. Do you savvy? It's a big job. An' I'm offerin' to make you my\n",
      "foreman right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, you sort of take my breath,” replied Dale. “An' I'm sure grateful.\n",
      "But the fact is, even if I could handle the job, I--I don't believe I'd\n",
      "want to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make yourself want to, then. Thet 'd soon come. You'd get interested.\n",
      "This country will develop. I seen thet years ago. The government is\n",
      "goin' to chase the Apaches out of here. Soon homesteaders will be\n",
      "flockin' in. Big future, Dale. You want to get in now. An'--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Auchincloss hesitated, then spoke lower:\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' take your chance with the girl!... I'll be on your side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A slight vibrating start ran over Dale's stalwart form.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al--you're plumb dotty!” he exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dotty! Me? Dotty!” ejaculated Auchincloss. Then he swore. “In a minit\n",
      "I'll tell you what you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Al, that talk's so--so--like an old fool's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Huh! An' why so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because that--wonderful girl would never look at me,” Dale replied,\n",
      "simply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen her lookin' already,” declared Al, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook his head as if arguing with the old rancher was hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind thet,” went on Al. “Mebbe I am a dotty old fool--'specially\n",
      "for takin' a shine to you. But I say again--will you come down to Pine\n",
      "and be my foreman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I've no son--an' I'm--afraid of Beasley.” This was uttered in an\n",
      "agitated whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, you make me ashamed,” said Dale, hoarsely. “I can't come. I've no\n",
      "nerve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You've no what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Al, I don't know what's wrong with me. But I'm afraid I'd find out if I\n",
      "came down there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! It's the girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't know, but I'm afraid so. An' I won't come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw yes, you will--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen rose with beating heart and tingling ears, and moved away out of\n",
      "hearing. She had listened too long to what had not been intended for her\n",
      "ears, yet she could not be sorry. She walked a few rods along the brook,\n",
      "out from under the pines, and, standing in the open edge of the park,\n",
      "she felt the beautiful scene still her agitation. The following\n",
      "moments, then, were the happiest she had spent in Paradise Park, and the\n",
      "profoundest of her whole life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently her uncle called her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, this here hunter wants to give you thet black hoss. An' I say you\n",
      "take him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ranger deserves better care than I can give him,” said Dale. “He runs\n",
      "free in the woods most of the time. I'd be obliged if she'd have him.\n",
      "An' the hound, Pedro, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo swept a saucy glance from Dale to her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure she'll have Ranger. Just offer him to ME!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood there expectantly, holding a blanket in his hand, ready to\n",
      "saddle the horse. Carmichael walked around Ranger with that appraising\n",
      "eye so keen in cowboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, do you know anything about horses?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me! Wal, if you ever buy or trade a hoss you shore have me there,”\n",
      " replied Carmichael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think of Ranger?” went on Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'd buy him sudden, if I could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Las Vegas, you're too late,” asserted Helen, as she advanced to lay\n",
      "a hand on the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ranger is mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale smoothed out the blanket and, folding it, he threw it over the\n",
      "horse; and then with one powerful swing he set the saddle in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you very much for him,” said Helen, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're welcome, an' I'm sure glad,” responded Dale, and then, after a\n",
      "few deft, strong pulls at the straps, he continued. “There, he's ready\n",
      "for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he laid an arm over the saddle, and faced Helen as she stood\n",
      "patting and smoothing Ranger. Helen, strong and calm now, in feminine\n",
      "possession of her secret and his, as well as her composure, looked\n",
      "frankly and steadily at Dale. He seemed composed, too, yet the bronze of\n",
      "his fine face was a trifle pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I can't thank you--I'll never be able to repay you--for your\n",
      "service to me and my sister,” said Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you needn't try,” Dale returned. “An' my service, as you call\n",
      "it, has been good for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going down to Pine with us?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“But you will come soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not very soon, I reckon,” he replied, and averted his gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hardly before spring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spring?... That is a long time. Won't you come to see me sooner than\n",
      "that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I can get down to Pine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're the first friend I've made in the West,” said Helen, earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll make many more--an' I reckon soon forget him you called the man\n",
      "of the forest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never forget any of my friends. And you've been the--the biggest\n",
      "friend I ever had.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll be proud to remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But will you remember--will you promise to come to Pine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you. All's well, then.... My friend, goodby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-by,” he said, clasping her hand. His glance was clear, warm,\n",
      "beautiful, yet it was sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auchincloss's hearty voice broke the spell. Then Helen saw that the\n",
      "others were mounted. Bo had ridden up close; her face was earnest\n",
      "and happy and grieved all at once, as she bade good-by to Dale. The\n",
      "pack-burros were hobbling along toward the green slope. Helen was the\n",
      "last to mount, but Roy was the last to leave the hunter. Pedro came\n",
      "reluctantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a merry, singing train which climbed that brown odorous trail,\n",
      "under the dark spruces. Helen assuredly was happy, yet a pang abided in\n",
      "her breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered that half-way up the slope there was a turn in the trail\n",
      "where it came out upon an open bluff. The time seemed long, but at last\n",
      "she got there. And she checked Ranger so as to have a moment's gaze down\n",
      "into the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "It yawned there, a dark-green and bright-gold gulf, asleep under a\n",
      "westering sun, exquisite, wild, lonesome. Then she saw Dale standing in\n",
      "the open space between the pines and the spruces. He waved to her. And\n",
      "she returned the salute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy caught up with her then and halted his horse. He waved his sombrero\n",
      "to Dale and let out a piercing yell that awoke the sleeping echoes,\n",
      "splitting strangely from cliff to cliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore Milt never knowed what it was to be lonesome,” said Roy, as if\n",
      "thinking aloud. “But he'll know now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranger stepped out of his own accord and, turning off the ledge, entered\n",
      "the spruce forest. Helen lost sight of Paradise Park. For hours then\n",
      "she rode along a shady, fragrant trail, seeing the beauty of color and\n",
      "wildness, hearing the murmur and rush and roar of water, but all the\n",
      "while her mind revolved the sweet and momentous realization which had\n",
      "thrilled her--that the hunter, this strange man of the forest, so deeply\n",
      "versed in nature and so unfamiliar with emotion, aloof and simple and\n",
      "strong like the elements which had developed him, had fallen in love\n",
      "with her and did not know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XV\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale stood with face and arm upraised, and he watched Helen ride off the\n",
      "ledge to disappear in the forest. That vast spruce slope seemed to have\n",
      "swallowed her. She was gone! Slowly Dale lowered his arm with gesture\n",
      "expressive of a strange finality, an eloquent despair, of which he was\n",
      "unconscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to the park, to his camp, and the many duties of a hunter. The\n",
      "park did not seem the same, nor his home, nor his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon this feelin's natural,” he soliloquized, resignedly, “but it's\n",
      "sure queer for me. That's what comes of makin' friends. Nell an' Bo,\n",
      "now, they made a difference, an' a difference I never knew before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He calculated that this difference had been simply one of\n",
      "responsibility, and then the charm and liveliness of the companionship\n",
      "of girls, and finally friendship. These would pass now that the causes\n",
      "were removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he had worked an hour around camp he realized a change had come,\n",
      "but it was not the one anticipated. Always before he had put his mind on\n",
      "his tasks, whatever they might be; now he worked while his thoughts were\n",
      "strangely involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little bear cub whined at his heels; the tame deer seemed to regard\n",
      "him with deep, questioning eyes, the big cougar padded softly here and\n",
      "there as if searching for something.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You all miss them--now--I reckon,” said Dale. “Well, they're gone an'\n",
      "you'll have to get along with me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some vague approach to irritation with his pets surprised him. Presently\n",
      "he grew both irritated and surprised with himself--a state of mind\n",
      "totally unfamiliar. Several times, as old habit brought momentary\n",
      "abstraction, he found himself suddenly looking around for Helen and\n",
      "Bo. And each time the shock grew stronger. They were gone, but their\n",
      "presence lingered. After his camp chores were completed he went over to\n",
      "pull down the lean-to which the girls had utilized as a tent. The spruce\n",
      "boughs had dried out brown and sear; the wind had blown the roof awry;\n",
      "the sides were leaning in. As there was now no further use for\n",
      "this little habitation, he might better pull it down. Dale did not\n",
      "acknowledge that his gaze had involuntarily wandered toward it many\n",
      "times. Therefore he strode over with the intention of destroying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time since Roy and he had built the lean-to he stepped\n",
      "inside. Nothing was more certain than the fact that he experienced a\n",
      "strange sensation, perfectly incomprehensible to him. The blankets\n",
      "lay there on the spruce boughs, disarranged and thrown back by hurried\n",
      "hands, yet still holding something of round folds where the slender\n",
      "forms had nestled. A black scarf often worn by Bo lay covering the\n",
      "pillow of pine-needles; a red ribbon that Helen had worn on her hair\n",
      "hung from a twig. These articles were all that had been forgotten. Dale\n",
      "gazed at them attentively, then at the blankets, and all around the\n",
      "fragrant little shelter; and he stepped outside with an uncomfortable\n",
      "knowledge that he could not destroy the place where Helen and Bo had\n",
      "spent so many hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon, in studious mood, Dale took up his rifle and strode out to\n",
      "hunt. His winter supply of venison had not yet been laid in. Action\n",
      "suited his mood; he climbed far and passed by many a watching buck\n",
      "to slay which seemed murder; at last he jumped one that was wild and\n",
      "bounded away. This he shot, and set himself a Herculean task in packing\n",
      "the whole carcass back to camp. Burdened thus, he staggered under the\n",
      "trees, sweating freely, many times laboring for breath, aching with\n",
      "toil, until at last he had reached camp. There he slid the deer carcass\n",
      "off his shoulders, and, standing over it, he gazed down while his breast\n",
      "labored. It was one of the finest young bucks he had ever seen. But\n",
      "neither in stalking it, nor making a wonderful shot, nor in packing home\n",
      "a weight that would have burdened two men, nor in gazing down at his\n",
      "beautiful quarry, did Dale experience any of the old joy of the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm a little off my feed,” he mused, as he wiped sweat from his heated\n",
      "face. “Maybe a little dotty, as I called Al. But that'll pass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever his state, it did not pass. As of old, after a long day's hunt,\n",
      "he reclined beside the camp-fire and watched the golden sunset glows\n",
      "change on the ramparts; as of old he laid a hand on the soft, furry head\n",
      "of the pet cougar; as of old he watched the gold change to red and then\n",
      "to dark, and twilight fall like a blanket; as of old he listened to\n",
      "the dreamy, lulling murmur of the water fall. The old familiar beauty,\n",
      "wildness, silence, and loneliness were there, but the old content seemed\n",
      "strangely gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soberly he confessed then that he missed the happy company of the girls.\n",
      "He did not distinguish Helen from Bo in his slow introspection. When\n",
      "he sought his bed he did not at once fall to sleep. Always, after a\n",
      "few moments of wakefulness, while the silence settled down or the wind\n",
      "moaned through the pines, he had fallen asleep. This night he found\n",
      "different. Though he was tired, sleep would not soon come. The\n",
      "wilderness, the mountains, the park, the camp--all seemed to have lost\n",
      "something. Even the darkness seemed empty. And when at length Dale fell\n",
      "asleep it was to be troubled by restless dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up with the keen-edged, steely-bright dawn, he went at the his tasks\n",
      "with the springy stride of the deer-stalker.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of that strenuous day, which was singularly full of the old\n",
      "excitement and action and danger, and of new observations, he was bound\n",
      "to confess that no longer did the chase suffice for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many times on the heights that day, with the wind keen in his face, and\n",
      "the vast green billows of spruce below him, he had found that he was\n",
      "gazing without seeing, halting without object, dreaming as he had never\n",
      "dreamed before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, when a magnificent elk came out upon a rocky ridge and, whistling\n",
      "a challenge to invisible rivals, stood there a target to stir any\n",
      "hunter's pulse, Dale did not even raise his rifle. Into his ear just\n",
      "then rang Helen's voice: “Milt Dale, you are no Indian. Giving yourself\n",
      "to a hunter's wildlife is selfish. It is wrong. You love this lonely\n",
      "life, but it is not work. Work that does not help others is not a real\n",
      "man's work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment conscience tormented him. It was not what he loved,\n",
      "but what he ought to do, that counted in the sum of good achieved in the\n",
      "world. Old Al Auchincloss had been right. Dale was wasting strength and\n",
      "intelligence that should go to do his share in the development of the\n",
      "West. Now that he had reached maturity, if through his knowledge of\n",
      "nature's law he had come to see the meaning of the strife of men for\n",
      "existence, for place, for possession, and to hold them in contempt, that\n",
      "was no reason why he should keep himself aloof from them, from some work\n",
      "that was needed in an incomprehensible world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale did not hate work, but he loved freedom. To be alone, to live with\n",
      "nature, to feel the elements, to labor and dream and idle and climb\n",
      "and sleep unhampered by duty, by worry, by restriction, by the petty\n",
      "interests of men--this had always been his ideal of living. Cowboys,\n",
      "riders, sheep-herders, farmers--these toiled on from one place and\n",
      "one job to another for the little money doled out to them. Nothing\n",
      "beautiful, nothing significant had ever existed in that for him. He had\n",
      "worked as a boy at every kind of range-work, and of all that humdrum\n",
      "waste of effort he had liked sawing wood best. Once he had quit a job\n",
      "of branding cattle because the smell of burning hide, the bawl of the\n",
      "terrified calf, had sickened him. If men were honest there would be no\n",
      "need to scar cattle. He had never in the least desired to own land and\n",
      "droves of stock, and make deals with ranchmen, deals advantageous to\n",
      "himself. Why should a man want to make a deal or trade a horse or do a\n",
      "piece of work to another man's disadvantage? Self-preservation was the\n",
      "first law of life. But as the plants and trees and birds and beasts\n",
      "interpreted that law, merciless and inevitable as they were, they had\n",
      "neither greed nor dishonesty. They lived by the grand rule of what was\n",
      "best for the greatest number.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dale's philosophy, cold and clear and inevitable, like nature\n",
      "itself, began to be pierced by the human appeal in Helen Rayner's words.\n",
      "What did she mean? Not that he should lose his love of the wilderness,\n",
      "but that he realize himself! Many chance words of that girl had depth.\n",
      "He was young, strong, intelligent, free from taint of disease or the\n",
      "fever of drink. He could do something for others. Who? If that mattered,\n",
      "there, for instance, was poor old Mrs. Cass, aged and lame now; there\n",
      "was Al Auchincloss, dying in his boots, afraid of enemies, and wistful\n",
      "for his blood and his property to receive the fruit of his labors; there\n",
      "were the two girls, Helen and Bo, new and strange to the West, about to\n",
      "be confronted by a big problem of ranch life and rival interests. Dale\n",
      "thought of still more people in the little village of Pine--of others\n",
      "who had failed, whose lives were hard, who could have been made happier\n",
      "by kindness and assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, was the duty of Milt Dale to himself? Because men preyed on\n",
      "one another and on the weak, should he turn his back upon a so-called\n",
      "civilization or should he grow like them? Clear as a bell came the\n",
      "answer that his duty was to do neither. And then he saw how the little\n",
      "village of Pine, as well as the whole world, needed men like him. He had\n",
      "gone to nature, to the forest, to the wilderness for his development;\n",
      "and all the judgments and efforts of his future would be a result of\n",
      "that education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Dale, lying in the darkness and silence of his lonely park, arrived\n",
      "at a conclusion that he divined was but the beginning of a struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took long introspection to determine the exact nature of that\n",
      "struggle, but at length it evolved into the paradox that Helen Rayner\n",
      "had opened his eyes to his duty as a man, that he accepted it, yet found\n",
      "a strange obstacle in the perplexing, tumultuous, sweet fear of ever\n",
      "going near her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, then, all his thought revolved around the girl, and, thrown\n",
      "off his balance, he weltered in a wilderness of unfamiliar strange\n",
      "ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he awoke next day the fight was on in earnest. In his sleep his\n",
      "mind had been active. The idea that greeted him, beautiful as the\n",
      "sunrise, flashed in memory of Auchincloss's significant words, “Take\n",
      "your chance with the girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old rancher was in his dotage. He hinted of things beyond the range\n",
      "of possibility. That idea of a chance for Dale remained before his\n",
      "consciousness only an instant. Stars were unattainable; life could\n",
      "not be fathomed; the secret of nature did not abide alone on the\n",
      "earth--these theories were not any more impossible of proving than that\n",
      "Helen Rayner might be for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, her strange coming into his life had played havoc, the\n",
      "extent of which he had only begun to realize.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a month he tramped through the forest. It was October, a still\n",
      "golden, fulfilling season of the year; and everywhere in the vast dark\n",
      "green a glorious blaze of oak and aspen made beautiful contrast. He\n",
      "carried his rifle, but he never used it. He would climb miles and go\n",
      "this way and that with no object in view. Yet his eye and ear had\n",
      "never been keener. Hours he would spend on a promontory, watching\n",
      "the distance, where the golden patches of aspen shone bright out\n",
      "of dark-green mountain slopes. He loved to fling himself down in an\n",
      "aspen-grove at the edge of a senaca, and there lie in that radiance like\n",
      "a veil of gold and purple and red, with the white tree-trunks striping\n",
      "the shade. Always, whether there were breeze or not, the aspen-leaves\n",
      "quivered, ceaselessly, wonderfully, like his pulses, beyond his control.\n",
      "Often he reclined against a mossy rock beside a mountain stream to\n",
      "listen, to watch, to feel all that was there, while his mind held a\n",
      "haunting, dark-eyed vision of a girl. On the lonely heights, like an\n",
      "eagle, he sat gazing down into Paradise Park, that was more and more\n",
      "beautiful, but would never again be the same, never fill him with\n",
      "content, never be all and all to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in October the first snow fell. It melted at once on the south side\n",
      "of the park, but the north slopes and the rims and domes above stayed\n",
      "white.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had worked quick and hard at curing and storing his winter supply\n",
      "of food, and now he spent days chopping and splitting wood to burn\n",
      "during the months he would be snowed-in. He watched for the dark-gray,\n",
      "fast-scudding storm-clouds, and welcomed them when they came. Once there\n",
      "lay ten feet of snow on the trails he would be snowed-in until spring.\n",
      "It would be impossible to go down to Pine. And perhaps during the long\n",
      "winter he would be cured of this strange, nameless disorder of his\n",
      "feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "November brought storms up on the peaks. Flurries of snow fell in\n",
      "the park every day, but the sunny south side, where Dale's camp lay,\n",
      "retained its autumnal color and warmth. Not till late in winter did the\n",
      "snow creep over this secluded nook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morning came at last, piercingly keen and bright, when Dale saw\n",
      "that the heights were impassable; the realization brought him a poignant\n",
      "regret. He had not guessed how he had wanted to see Helen Rayner again\n",
      "until it was too late. That opened his eyes. A raging frenzy of action\n",
      "followed, in which he only tired himself physically without helping\n",
      "himself spiritually.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was sunset when he faced the west, looking up at the pink snow-domes\n",
      "and the dark-golden fringe of spruce, and in that moment he found the\n",
      "truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love that girl! I love that girl!” he spoke aloud, to the distant\n",
      "white peaks, to the winds, to the loneliness and silence of his prison,\n",
      "to the great pines and to the murmuring stream, and to his faithful\n",
      "pets. It was his tragic confession of weakness, of amazing truth, of\n",
      "hopeless position, of pitiful excuse for the transformation wrought in\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's struggle ended there when he faced his soul. To understand\n",
      "himself was to be released from strain, worry, ceaseless importuning\n",
      "doubt and wonder and fear. But the fever of unrest, of uncertainty, had\n",
      "been nothing compared to a sudden upflashing torment of love.\n",
      "\n",
      "With somber deliberation he set about the tasks needful, and others\n",
      "that he might make--his camp-fires and meals, the care of his pets and\n",
      "horses, the mending of saddles and pack-harness, the curing of buckskin\n",
      "for moccasins and hunting-suits. So his days were not idle. But all this\n",
      "work was habit for him and needed no application of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Dale, like some men of lonely wilderness lives who did not\n",
      "retrograde toward the savage, was a thinker. Love made him a sufferer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surprise and shame of his unconscious surrender, the certain\n",
      "hopelessness of it, the long years of communion with all that was wild,\n",
      "lonely, and beautiful, the wonderfully developed insight into nature's\n",
      "secrets, and the sudden-dawning revelation that he was no omniscient\n",
      "being exempt from the ruthless ordinary destiny of man--all these showed\n",
      "him the strength of his manhood and of his passion, and that the life\n",
      "he had chosen was of all lives the one calculated to make love sad and\n",
      "terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Rayner haunted him. In the sunlight there was not a place\n",
      "around camp which did not picture her lithe, vigorous body, her dark,\n",
      "thoughtful eyes, her eloquent, resolute lips, and the smile that was so\n",
      "sweet and strong. At night she was there like a slender specter, pacing\n",
      "beside him under the moaning pines. Every camp-fire held in its heart\n",
      "the glowing white radiance of her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nature had taught Dale to love solitude and silence, but love itself\n",
      "taught him their meaning. Solitude had been created for the eagle on his\n",
      "crag, for the blasted mountain fir, lonely and gnarled on its peak, for\n",
      "the elk and the wolf. But it had not been intended for man. And to\n",
      "live always in the silence of wild places was to become obsessed with\n",
      "self--to think and dream--to be happy, which state, however pursued by\n",
      "man, was not good for him. Man must be given imperious longings for the\n",
      "unattainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It needed, then, only the memory of an unattainable woman to render\n",
      "solitude passionately desired by a man, yet almost unendurable. Dale was\n",
      "alone with his secret; and every pine, everything in that park saw him\n",
      "shaken and undone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dark, pitchy deadness of night, when there was no wind and the\n",
      "cold on the peaks had frozen the waterfall, then the silence seemed\n",
      "insupportable. Many hours that should have been given to slumber were\n",
      "paced out under the cold, white, pitiless stars, under the lonely pines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale's memory betrayed him, mocked his restraint, cheated him of\n",
      "any peace; and his imagination, sharpened by love, created pictures,\n",
      "fancies, feelings, that drove him frantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of Helen Rayner's strong, shapely brown hand. In a thousand\n",
      "different actions it haunted him. How quick and deft in camp-fire tasks!\n",
      "how graceful and swift as she plaited her dark hair! how tender and\n",
      "skilful in its ministration when one of his pets had been injured! how\n",
      "eloquent when pressed tight against her breast in a moment of fear on\n",
      "the dangerous heights! how expressive of unutterable things when laid on\n",
      "his arm!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale saw that beautiful hand slowly creep up his arm, across his\n",
      "shoulder, and slide round his neck to clasp there. He was powerless to\n",
      "inhibit the picture. And what he felt then was boundless, unutterable.\n",
      "No woman had ever yet so much as clasped his hand, and heretofore no\n",
      "such imaginings had ever crossed his mind, yet deep in him, somewhere\n",
      "hidden, had been this waiting, sweet, and imperious need. In the bright\n",
      "day he appeared to ward off such fancies, but at night he was helpless.\n",
      "And every fancy left him weaker, wilder.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, at the culmination of this phase of his passion, Dale, who\n",
      "had never known the touch of a woman's lips, suddenly yielded to the\n",
      "illusion of Helen Rayner's kisses, he found himself quite mad, filled\n",
      "with rapture and despair, loving her as he hated himself. It seemed as\n",
      "if he had experienced all these terrible feelings in some former life\n",
      "and had forgotten them in this life. He had no right to think of her,\n",
      "but he could not resist it. Imagining the sweet surrender of her lips\n",
      "was a sacrilege, yet here, in spite of will and honor and shame, he was\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale, at length, was vanquished, and he ceased to rail at himself, or\n",
      "restrain his fancies. He became a dreamy, sad-eyed, camp-fire gazer,\n",
      "like many another lonely man, separated, by chance or error, from what\n",
      "the heart hungered most for. But this great experience, when all its\n",
      "significance had clarified in his mind, immeasurably broadened his\n",
      "understanding of the principles of nature applied to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love had been in him stronger than in most men, because of his keen,\n",
      "vigorous, lonely years in the forest, where health of mind and body were\n",
      "intensified and preserved. How simple, how natural, how inevitable! He\n",
      "might have loved any fine-spirited, healthy-bodied girl. Like a tree\n",
      "shooting its branches and leaves, its whole entity, toward the sunlight,\n",
      "so had he grown toward a woman's love. Why? Because the thing he revered\n",
      "in nature, the spirit, the universal, the life that was God, had created\n",
      "at his birth or before his birth the three tremendous instincts of\n",
      "nature--to fight for life, to feed himself, to reproduce his kind. That\n",
      "was all there was to it. But oh! the mystery, the beauty, the torment,\n",
      "and the terror of this third instinct--this hunger for the sweetness and\n",
      "the glory of a woman's love!\n",

      "CHAPTER XVI\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen Rayner dropped her knitting into her lap and sat pensively gazing\n",
      "out of the window over the bare yellow ranges of her uncle's ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The winter day was bright, but steely, and the wind that whipped down\n",
      "from the white-capped mountains had a keen, frosty edge. A scant snow\n",
      "lay in protected places; cattle stood bunched in the lee of ridges; low\n",
      "sheets of dust scurried across the flats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big living-room of the ranch-house was warm and comfortable with its\n",
      "red adobe walls, its huge stone fireplace where cedar logs blazed, and\n",
      "its many-colored blankets. Bo Rayner sat before the fire, curled up in\n",
      "an armchair, absorbed in a book. On the floor lay the hound Pedro, his\n",
      "racy, fine head stretched toward the warmth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did uncle call?” asked Helen, with a start out of her reverie.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn't hear him,” replied Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen rose to tiptoe across the floor, and, softly parting some\n",
      "curtains, she looked into the room where her uncle lay. He was asleep.\n",
      "Sometimes he called out in his slumbers. For weeks now he had been\n",
      "confined to his bed, slowly growing weaker. With a sigh Helen returned\n",
      "to her window-seat and took up her work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, the sun is bright,” she said. “The days are growing longer. I'm so\n",
      "glad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, you're always wishing time away. For me it passes quickly\n",
      "enough,” replied the sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I love spring and summer and fall--and I guess I hate winter,”\n",
      " returned Helen, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellow ranges rolled away up to the black ridges and they in turn\n",
      "swept up to the cold, white mountains. Helen's gaze seemed to go beyond\n",
      "that snowy barrier. And Bo's keen eyes studied her sister's earnest, sad\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, do you ever think of Dale?” she queried, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question startled Helen. A slow blush suffused neck and cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” she replied, as if surprised that Bo should ask such a\n",
      "thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I shouldn't have asked that,” said Bo, softly, and then bent again\n",
      "over her book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed tenderly at that bright, bowed head. In this swift-flying,\n",
      "eventful, busy winter, during which the management of the ranch had\n",
      "devolved wholly upon Helen, the little sister had grown away from her.\n",
      "Bo had insisted upon her own free will and she had followed it, to\n",
      "the amusement of her uncle, to the concern of Helen, to the dismay and\n",
      "bewilderment of the faithful Mexican housekeeper, and to the undoing of\n",
      "all the young men on the ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had always been hoping and waiting for a favorable hour in which\n",
      "she might find this wilful sister once more susceptible to wise and\n",
      "loving influence. But while she hesitated to speak, slow footsteps and a\n",
      "jingle of spurs sounded without, and then came a timid knock. Bo looked\n",
      "up brightly and ran to open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! It's only--YOU!” she uttered, in withering scorn, to the one who\n",
      "knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen thought she could guess who that was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you-all?” asked a drawling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Mister Carmichael, if that interests you--I'm quite ill,” replied\n",
      "Bo, freezingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ill! Aw no, now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a fact. If I don't die right off I'll have to be taken back to\n",
      "Missouri,” said Bo, casually.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you goin' to ask me in?” queried Carmichael, bluntly. “It's\n",
      "cold--an' I've got somethin' to say to--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To ME? Well, you're not backward, I declare,” retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Rayner, I reckon it 'll be strange to you--findin' out I didn't\n",
      "come to see you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed! No. But what was strange was the deluded idea I had--that you\n",
      "meant to apologize to me--like a gentleman.... Come in, Mr. Carmichael.\n",
      "My sister is here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The door closed as Helen turned round. Carmichael stood just inside with\n",
      "his sombrero in hand, and as he gazed at Bo his lean face seemed hard.\n",
      "In the few months since autumn he had changed--aged, it seemed, and the\n",
      "once young, frank, alert, and careless cowboy traits had merged into the\n",
      "making of a man. Helen knew just how much of a man he really was. He had\n",
      "been her mainstay during all the complex working of the ranch that had\n",
      "fallen upon her shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I reckon you was deluded, all right--if you thought I'd crawl like\n",
      "them other lovers of yours,” he said, with cool deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo turned pale, and her eyes fairly blazed, yet even in what must have\n",
      "been her fury Helen saw amaze and pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“OTHER lovers? I think the biggest delusion here is the way you flatter\n",
      "yourself,” replied Bo, stingingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me flatter myself? Nope. You don't savvy me. I'm shore hatin' myself\n",
      "these days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Small wonder. I certainly hate you--with all my heart!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this retort the cowboy dropped his head and did not see Bo flaunt\n",
      "herself out of the room. But he heard the door close, and then slowly\n",
      "came toward Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cheer up, Las Vegas,” said Helen, smiling. “Bo's hot-tempered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, I'm just like a dog. The meaner she treats me the more I\n",
      "love her,” he replied, dejectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen's first instinct of liking for this cowboy there had been added\n",
      "admiration, respect, and a growing appreciation of strong, faithful,\n",
      "developing character. Carmichael's face and hands were red and chapped\n",
      "from winter winds; the leather of wrist-bands, belt, and boots was all\n",
      "worn shiny and thin; little streaks of dust fell from him as he breathed\n",
      "heavily. He no longer looked the dashing cowboy, ready for a dance or\n",
      "lark or fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How in the world did you offend her so?” asked Helen. “Bo is furious. I\n",
      "never saw her so angry as that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, it was jest this way,” began Carmichael. “Shore Bo's knowed\n",
      "I was in love with her. I asked her to marry me an' she wouldn't say\n",
      "yes or no.... An', mean as it sounds--she never run away from it, thet's\n",
      "shore. We've had some quarrels--two of them bad, an' this last's the\n",
      "worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo told me about one quarrel,” said Helen. “It was--because you\n",
      "drank--that time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it was. She took one of her cold spells an' I jest got drunk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that was wrong,” protested Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ain't so shore. You see, I used to get drunk often--before I come\n",
      "here. An' I've been drunk only once. Back at Las Vegas the outfit would\n",
      "never believe thet. Wal, I promised Bo I wouldn't do it again, an' I've\n",
      "kept my word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is fine of you. But tell me, why is she angry now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo makes up to all the fellars,” confessed Carmichael, hanging his\n",
      "head. “I took her to the dance last week--over in the town-hall. Thet's\n",
      "the first time she'd gone anywhere with me. I shore was proud.... But\n",
      "thet dance was hell. Bo carried on somethin' turrible, an' I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me. What did she do?” demanded Helen, anxiously. “I'm responsible\n",
      "for her. I've got to see that she behaves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, I ain't sayin' she didn't behave like a lady,” replied Carmichael.\n",
      "“It was--she--wal, all them fellars are fools over her--an' Bo wasn't\n",
      "true to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear boy, is Bo engaged to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord--if she only was!” he sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then how can you say she wasn't true to you? Be reasonable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon now, Miss Nell, thet no one can be in love an' act\n",
      "reasonable,” rejoined the cowboy. “I don't know how to explain, but the\n",
      "fact is I feel thet Bo has played the--the devil with me an' all the\n",
      "other fellars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean she has flirted?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I'm afraid you're right,” said Helen, with growing\n",
      "apprehension. “Go on. Tell me what's happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, thet Turner boy, who rides for Beasley, he was hot after Bo,”\n",
      " returned Carmichael, and he spoke as if memory hurt him. “Reckon I've\n",
      "no use for Turner. He's a fine-lookin', strappin', big cow-puncher, an'\n",
      "calculated to win the girls. He brags thet he can, an' I reckon he's\n",
      "right. Wal, he was always hangin' round Bo. An' he stole one of my\n",
      "dances with Bo. I only had three, an' he comes up to say this one was\n",
      "his; Bo, very innocent--oh, she's a cute one!--she says, 'Why, Mister\n",
      "Turner--is it really yours?' An' she looked so full of joy thet when he\n",
      "says to me, 'Excoose us, friend Carmichael,' I sat there like a locoed\n",
      "jackass an' let them go. But I wasn't mad at thet. He was a better\n",
      "dancer than me an' I wanted her to have a good time. What started the\n",
      "hell was I seen him put his arm round her when it wasn't just time,\n",
      "accordin' to the dance, an' Bo--she didn't break any records gettin'\n",
      "away from him. She pushed him away--after a little--after I near died.\n",
      "Wal, on the way home I had to tell her. I shore did. An' she said what\n",
      "I'd love to forget. Then--then, Miss Nell, I grabbed her--it was outside\n",
      "here by the porch an' all bright moonlight--I grabbed her an' hugged an'\n",
      "kissed her good. When I let her go I says, sorta brave, but I was plumb\n",
      "scared--I says, 'Wal, are you goin' to marry me now?'”\n",
      "\n",
      "He concluded with a gulp, and looked at Helen with woe in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! What did Bo do?” breathlessly queried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She slapped me,” he replied. “An' then she says, I did like you best,\n",
      "but NOW I hate you!' An' she slammed the door in my face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you made a great mistake,” said Helen, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if I thought so I'd beg her forgiveness. But I reckon I don't.\n",
      "What's more, I feel better than before. I'm only a cowboy an' never was\n",
      "much good till I met her. Then I braced. I got to havin' hopes, studyin'\n",
      "books, an' you know how I've been lookin' into this ranchin' game. I\n",
      "stopped drinkin' an' saved my money. Wal, she knows all thet. Once she\n",
      "said she was proud of me. But it didn't seem to count big with her.\n",
      "An' if it can't count big I don't want it to count at all. I reckon the\n",
      "madder Bo is at me the more chance I've got. She knows I love her--thet\n",
      "I'd die for her--thet I'm a changed man. An' she knows I never before\n",
      "thought of darin' to touch her hand. An' she knows she flirted with\n",
      "Turner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's only a child,” replied Helen. “And all this change--the West--the\n",
      "wildness--and you boys making much of her--why, it's turned her head.\n",
      "But Bo will come out of it true blue. She is good, loving. Her heart is\n",
      "gold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon I know, an' my faith can't be shook,” rejoined Carmichael,\n",
      "simply. “But she ought to believe thet she'll make bad blood out\n",
      "here. The West is the West. Any kind of girls are scarce. An' one like\n",
      "Bo--Lord! we cowboys never seen none to compare with her. She'll make\n",
      "bad blood an' some of it will be spilled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Uncle Al encourages her,” said Helen, apprehensively. “It tickles him\n",
      "to hear how the boys are after her. Oh, she doesn't tell him. But he\n",
      "hears. And I, who must stand in mother's place to her, what can I do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, are you on my side?” asked the cowboy, wistfully. He was\n",
      "strong and elemental, caught in the toils of some power beyond him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday Helen might have hesitated at that question. But to-day\n",
      "Carmichael brought some proven quality of loyalty, some strange depth of\n",
      "rugged sincerity, as if she had learned his future worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am,” Helen replied, earnestly. And she offered her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, then it 'll shore turn out happy,” he said, squeezing her hand.\n",
      "His smile was grateful, but there was nothing in it of the victory he\n",
      "hinted at. Some of his ruddy color had gone. “An' now I want to tell you\n",
      "why I come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had lowered his voice. “Is Al asleep?” he whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Helen. “He was a little while ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I'd better shut his door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched the cowboy glide across the room and carefully close the\n",
      "door, then return to her with intent eyes. She sensed events in his\n",
      "look, and she divined suddenly that he must feel as if he were her\n",
      "brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'm the one thet fetches all the bad news to you,” he said,\n",
      "regretfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen caught her breath. There had indeed been many little calamities\n",
      "to mar her management of the ranch--loss of cattle, horses, sheep--the\n",
      "desertion of herders to Beasley--failure of freighters to arrive\n",
      "when most needed--fights among the cowboys--and disagreements over\n",
      "long-arranged deals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your uncle Al makes a heap of this here Jeff Mulvey,” asserted\n",
      "Carmichael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed. Uncle absolutely relies on Jeff,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I hate to tell you, Miss Nell,” said the cowboy, bitterly, “thet\n",
      "Mulvey ain't the man he seems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, what do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When your uncle dies Mulvey is goin' over to Beasley an' he's goin' to\n",
      "take all the fellars who'll stick to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Could Jeff be so faithless--after so many years my uncle's foreman? Oh,\n",
      "how do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I guessed long ago. But wasn't shore. Miss Nell, there's a\n",
      "lot in the wind lately, as poor old Al grows weaker. Mulvey has been\n",
      "particular friendly to me an' I've nursed him along, 'cept I wouldn't\n",
      "drink. An' his pards have been particular friends with me, too, more\n",
      "an' more as I loosened up. You see, they was shy of me when I first got\n",
      "here. To-day the whole deal showed clear to me like a hoof track in soft\n",
      "ground. Bud Lewis, who's bunked with me, come out an' tried to win me\n",
      "over to Beasley--soon as Auchincloss dies. I palavered with Bud an' I\n",
      "wanted to know. But Bud would only say he was goin' along with Jeff an'\n",
      "others of the outfit. I told him I'd reckon over it an' let him know. He\n",
      "thinks I'll come round.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--why will these men leave me when--when--Oh, poor uncle! They\n",
      "bargain on his death. But why--tell me why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley has worked on them--won them over,” replied Carmichael, grimly.\n",
      "“After Al dies the ranch will go to you. Beasley means to have it. He\n",
      "an' Al was pards once, an' now Beasley has most folks here believin' he\n",
      "got the short end of thet deal. He'll have papers--shore--an' he'll have\n",
      "most of the men. So he'll just put you off an' take possession. Thet's\n",
      "all, Miss Nell, an' you can rely on its bein' true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I believe you--but I can't believe such--such robbery possible,”\n",
      " gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's simple as two an' two. Possession is law out here. Once Beasley\n",
      "gets on the ground it's settled. What could you do with no men to fight\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I reckon. But not enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I can hire more. The Beeman boys. And Dale would come to help me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale would come. An' he'd help a heap. I wish he was here,” replied\n",
      "Carmichael, soberly. “But there's no way to get him. He's snowed-up till\n",
      "May.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare not confide in uncle,” said Helen, with agitation. “The shock\n",
      "might kill him. Then to tell him of the unfaithfulness of his old\n",
      "men--that would be cruel.... Oh, it can't be so bad as you think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon it couldn't be no worse. An'--Miss Nell, there's only one way\n",
      "to get out of it--an' thet's the way of the West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How?” queried Helen, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael lunged himself erect and stood gazing down at her. He seemed\n",
      "completely detached now from that frank, amiable cowboy of her first\n",
      "impressions. The redness was totally gone from his face. Something\n",
      "strange and cold and sure looked out of his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen Beasley go in the saloon as I rode past. Suppose I go down\n",
      "there, pick a quarrel with him--an' kill him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen sat bolt-upright with a cold shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael! you're not serious?” she exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serious? I shore am. Thet's the only way, Miss Nell. An' I reckon it's\n",
      "what Al would want. An' between you an' me--it would be easier than\n",
      "ropin' a calf. These fellars round Pine don't savvy guns. Now, I come\n",
      "from where guns mean somethin'. An' when I tell you I can throw a gun\n",
      "slick an' fast, why I shore ain't braggin'. You needn't worry none about\n",
      "me, Miss Nell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen grasped that he had taken the signs of her shocked sensibility\n",
      "to mean she feared for his life. But what had sickened her was the mere\n",
      "idea of bloodshed in her behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'd--kill Beasley--just because there are rumors of his--treachery?”\n",
      " gasped Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. It'll have to be done, anyhow,” replied the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! No! It's too dreadful to think of. Why, that would be murder. I--I\n",
      "can't understand how you speak of it--so--so calmly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I ain't doin' it calmly. I'm as mad as hell,” said Carmichael,\n",
      "with a reckless smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, if you are serious then, I say no--no--no! I forbid you. I don't\n",
      "believe I'll be robbed of my property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, supposin' Beasley does put you off--an' takes possession. What 're\n",
      "you goin' to say then?” demanded the cowboy, in slow, cool deliberation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd say the same then as now,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent his head thoughtfully while his red hands smoothed his sombrero.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore you girls haven't been West very long,” he muttered, as if\n",
      "apologizing for them. “An' I reckon it takes time to learn the ways of a\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“West or no West, I won't have fights deliberately picked, and men shot,\n",
      "even if they do threaten me,” declared Helen, positively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, Miss Nell, shore I respect your wishes,” he returned. “But\n",
      "I'll tell you this. If Beasley turns you an' Bo out of your home--wal,\n",
      "I'll look him up on my own account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could only gaze at him as he backed to the door, and she thrilled\n",
      "and shuddered at what seemed his loyalty to her, his love for Bo, and\n",
      "that which was inevitable in himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you might save us all some trouble--now if you'd--just get\n",
      "mad--an' let me go after thet greaser.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Greaser! Do you mean Beasley?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. He's a half-breed. He was born in Magdalena, where I heard folks\n",
      "say nary one of his parents was no good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That doesn't matter. I'm thinking of humanity of law and order. Of what\n",
      "is right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Miss Nell, I'll wait till you get real mad--or till Beasley--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, my friend, I'll not get mad,” interrupted Helen. “I'll keep my\n",
      "temper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet you don't,” he retorted. “Mebbe you think you've none of Bo in\n",
      "you. But I'll bet you could get so mad--once you started--thet you'd\n",
      "be turrible. What 've you got them eyes for, Miss Nell, if you ain't an\n",
      "Auchincloss?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was smiling, yet he meant every word. Helen felt the truth as\n",
      "something she feared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I won't bet. But you--you will always come to me--first--if\n",
      "there's trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise,” he replied, soberly, and then went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen found that she was trembling, and that there was a commotion in\n",
      "her breast. Carmichael had frightened her. No longer did she hold doubt\n",
      "of the gravity of the situation. She had seen Beasley often, several\n",
      "times close at hand, and once she had been forced to meet him. That time\n",
      "had convinced her that he had evinced personal interest in her. And on\n",
      "this account, coupled with the fact that Riggs appeared to have nothing\n",
      "else to do but shadow her, she had been slow in developing her intention\n",
      "of organizing and teaching a school for the children of Pine. Riggs had\n",
      "become rather a doubtful celebrity in the settlements. Yet his bold,\n",
      "apparent badness had made its impression. From all reports he spent his\n",
      "time gambling, drinking, and bragging. It was no longer news in Pine\n",
      "what his intentions were toward Helen Rayner. Twice he had ridden up to\n",
      "the ranch-house, upon one occasion securing an interview with Helen. In\n",
      "spite of her contempt and indifference, he was actually influencing her\n",
      "life there in Pine. And it began to appear that the other man, Beasley,\n",
      "might soon direct stronger significance upon the liberty of her actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The responsibility of the ranch had turned out to be a heavy burden. It\n",
      "could not be managed, at least by her, in the way Auchincloss wanted\n",
      "it done. He was old, irritable, irrational, and hard. Almost all the\n",
      "neighbors were set against him, and naturally did not take kindly to\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not found the slightest evidence of unfair dealing on the part\n",
      "of her uncle, but he had been a hard driver. Then his shrewd, far-seeing\n",
      "judgment had made all his deals fortunate for him, which fact had not\n",
      "brought a profit of friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of late, since Auchincloss had grown weaker and less dominating, Helen\n",
      "had taken many decisions upon herself, with gratifying and hopeful\n",
      "results. But the wonderful happiness that she had expected to find in\n",
      "the West still held aloof. The memory of Paradise Park seemed only a\n",
      "dream, sweeter and more intangible as time passed, and fuller of vague\n",
      "regrets. Bo was a comfort, but also a very considerable source of\n",
      "anxiety. She might have been a help to Helen if she had not assimilated\n",
      "Western ways so swiftly. Helen wished to decide things in her own way,\n",
      "which was as yet quite far from Western. So Helen had been thrown more\n",
      "and more upon her own resources, with the cowboy Carmichael the only one\n",
      "who had come forward voluntarily to her aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an hour Helen sat alone in the room, looking out of the window, and\n",
      "facing stern reality with a colder, graver, keener sense of intimacy\n",
      "than ever before. To hold her property and to live her life in this\n",
      "community according to her ideas of honesty, justice, and law might well\n",
      "be beyond her powers. To-day she had been convinced that she could not\n",
      "do so without fighting for them, and to fight she must have friends.\n",
      "That conviction warmed her toward Carmichael, and a thoughtful\n",
      "consideration of all he had done for her proved that she had not fully\n",
      "appreciated him. She would make up for her oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no Mormons in her employ, for the good reason that\n",
      "Auchincloss would not hire them. But in one of his kindlier hours,\n",
      "growing rare now, he had admitted that the Mormons were the best and the\n",
      "most sober, faithful workers on the ranges, and that his sole objection\n",
      "to them was just this fact of their superiority. Helen decided to hire\n",
      "the four Beemans and any of their relatives or friends who would come;\n",
      "and to do this, if possible, without letting her uncle know. His temper\n",
      "now, as well as his judgment, was a hindrance to efficiency. This\n",
      "decision regarding the Beemans; brought Helen back to Carmichael's\n",
      "fervent wish for Dale, and then to her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon spring would be at hand, with its multiplicity of range tasks. Dale\n",
      "had promised to come to Pine then, and Helen knew that promise would be\n",
      "kept. Her heart beat a little faster, in spite of her business-centered\n",
      "thoughts. Dale was there, over the black-sloped, snowy-tipped mountain,\n",
      "shut away from the world. Helen almost envied him. No wonder he loved\n",
      "loneliness, solitude, the sweet, wild silence and beauty of Paradise\n",
      "Park! But he was selfish, and Helen meant to show him that. She needed\n",
      "his help. When she recalled his physical prowess with animals, and\n",
      "imagined what it must be in relation to men, she actually smiled at the\n",
      "thought of Beasley forcing her off her property, if Dale were there.\n",
      "Beasley would only force disaster upon himself. Then Helen experienced\n",
      "a quick shock. Would Dale answer to this situation as Carmichael had\n",
      "answered? It afforded her relief to assure herself to the contrary.\n",
      "The cowboy was one of a blood-letting breed; the hunter was a man of\n",
      "thought, gentleness, humanity. This situation was one of the kind that\n",
      "had made him despise the littleness of men. Helen assured herself\n",
      "that he was different from her uncle and from the cowboy, in all the\n",
      "relations of life which she had observed while with him. But a doubt\n",
      "lingered in her mind. She remembered his calm reference to Snake Anson,\n",
      "and that caused a recurrence of the little shiver Carmichael had given\n",
      "her. When the doubt augmented to a possibility that she might not be\n",
      "able to control Dale, then she tried not to think of it any more. It\n",
      "confused and perplexed her that into her mind should flash a thought\n",
      "that, though it would be dreadful for Carmichael to kill Beasley, for\n",
      "Dale to do it would be a calamity--a terrible thing. Helen did not\n",
      "analyze that strange thought. She was as afraid of it as she was of the\n",
      "stir in her blood when she visualized Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her meditation was interrupted by Bo, who entered the room,\n",
      "rebellious-eyed and very lofty. Her manner changed, which apparently\n",
      "owed its cause to the fact that Helen was alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that--cowboy gone?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. He left quite some time ago,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wondered if he made your eyes shine--your color burn so. Nell, you're\n",
      "just beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is my face burning?” asked Helen, with a little laugh. “So it is.\n",
      "Well, Bo, you've no cause for jealousy. Las Vegas can't be blamed for my\n",
      "blushes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jealous! Me? Of that wild-eyed, soft-voiced, two-faced cow-puncher? I\n",
      "guess not, Nell Rayner. What 'd he say about me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, he said a lot,” replied Helen, reflectively. “I'll tell you\n",
      "presently. First I want to ask you--has Carmichael ever told you how\n",
      "he's helped me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! When I see him--which hasn't been often lately--he--I--Well, we\n",
      "fight. Nell, has he helped you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen smiled in faint amusement. She was going to be sincere, but she\n",
      "meant to keep her word to the cowboy. The fact was that reflection had\n",
      "acquainted her with her indebtedness to Carmichael.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you've been so wild to ride half-broken mustangs--and carry on with\n",
      "cowboys--and read--and sew--and keep your secrets that you've had no\n",
      "time for your sister or her troubles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!” burst out Bo, in amaze and pain. She flew to Helen and seized\n",
      "her hands. “What 're you saying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's all true,” replied Helen, thrilling and softening. This sweet\n",
      "sister, once aroused, would be hard to resist. Helen imagined she should\n",
      "hold to her tone of reproach and severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure it's true,” cried Bo, fiercely. “But what's my fooling got to do\n",
      "with the--the rest you said? Nell, are you keeping things from me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, I never get any encouragement to tell you my troubles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I've--I've nursed uncle--sat up with him--just the same as you,”\n",
      " said Bo, with quivering lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, you've been good to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We've no other troubles, have we, Nell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You haven't, but I have,” responded Helen, reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--why didn't you tell me?” cried Bo, passionately. “What are they?\n",
      "Tell me now. You must think me a--a selfish, hateful cat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I've had much to worry me--and the worst is yet to come,” replied\n",
      "Helen. Then she told Bo how complicated and bewildering was the\n",
      "management of a big ranch--when the owner was ill, testy, defective in\n",
      "memory, and hard as steel--when he had hoards of gold and notes, but\n",
      "could not or would not remember his obligations--when the neighbor\n",
      "ranchers had just claims--when cowboys and sheep-herders were\n",
      "discontented, and wrangled among themselves--when great herds of cattle\n",
      "and flocks of sheep had to be fed in winter--when supplies had to be\n",
      "continually freighted across a muddy desert and lastly, when an enemy\n",
      "rancher was slowly winning away the best hands with the end in view of\n",
      "deliberately taking over the property when the owner died. Then Helen\n",
      "told how she had only that day realized the extent of Carmichael's\n",
      "advice and help and labor--how, indeed, he had been a brother to\n",
      "her--how--\n",
      "\n",
      "But at this juncture Bo buried her face in Helen's breast and began to\n",
      "cry wildly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I--don't want--to hear--any more,” she sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you've got to hear it,” replied Helen, inexorably “I want you to\n",
      "know how he's stood by me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I hate him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I suspect that's not true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do--I do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you act and talk very strangely then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell Rayner--are--you--you sticking up for that--that devil?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am, yes, so far as it concerns my conscience,” rejoined Helen,\n",
      "earnestly. “I never appreciated him as he deserved--not until now. He's\n",
      "a man, Bo, every inch of him. I've seen him grow up to that in three\n",
      "months. I'd never have gotten along without him. I think he's fine,\n",
      "manly, big. I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll bet--he's made love--to you, too,” replied Bo, woefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talk sense,” said Helen, sharply. “He has been a brother to me. But,\n",
      "Bo Rayner, if he HAD made love to me I--I might have appreciated it more\n",
      "than you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo raised her face, flushed in part and also pale, with tear-wet cheeks\n",
      "and the telltale blaze in the blue eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've been wild about that fellow. But I hate him, too,” she said, with\n",
      "flashing spirit. “And I want to go on hating him. So don't tell me any\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Helen briefly and graphically related how Carmichael had\n",
      "offered to kill Beasley, as the only way to save her property, and how,\n",
      "when she refused, that he threatened he would do it anyhow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo fell over with a gasp and clung to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--Nell! Oh, now I love him more than--ever,” she cried, in mingled\n",
      "rage and despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen clasped her closely and tried to comfort her as in the old days,\n",
      "not so very far back, when troubles were not so serious as now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you love him,” she concluded. “I guessed that long ago. And\n",
      "I'm glad. But you've been wilful--foolish. You wouldn't surrender to it.\n",
      "You wanted your fling with the other boys. You're--Oh, Bo, I fear you\n",
      "have been a sad little flirt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I wasn't very bad till--till he got bossy. Why, Nell, he\n",
      "acted--right off--just as if he OWNED me. But he didn't.... And to show\n",
      "him--I--I really did flirt with that Turner fellow. Then he--he insulted\n",
      "me.... Oh, I hate him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense, Bo. You can't hate any one while you love him,” protested\n",
      "Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much you know about that,” flashed Bo. “You just can! Look here. Did\n",
      "you ever see a cowboy rope and throw and tie up a mean horse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you have any idea how strong a cowboy is--how his hands and arms are\n",
      "like iron?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'm sure I know that, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how savage he is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how he goes at anything he wants to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must admit cowboys are abrupt,” responded Helen, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Miss Rayner, did you ever--when you were standing quiet like a\n",
      "lady--did you ever have a cowboy dive at you with a terrible lunge--grab\n",
      "you and hold you so you couldn't move or breathe or scream--hug you\n",
      "till all your bones cracked--and kiss you so fierce and so hard that you\n",
      "wanted to kill him and die?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had gradually drawn back from this blazing-eyed, eloquent sister,\n",
      "and when the end of that remarkable question came it was impossible to\n",
      "reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! I see you never had that done to you,” resumed Bo, with\n",
      "satisfaction. “So don't ever talk to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've heard his side of the story,” said Helen, constrainedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a start Bo sat up straighter, as if better to defend herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So you have? And I suppose you'll take his part--even about\n",
      "that--that bearish trick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I think that rude and bold. But, Bo, I don't believe he meant to\n",
      "be either rude or bold. From what he confessed to me I gather that he\n",
      "believed he'd lose you outright or win you outright by that violence. It\n",
      "seems girls can't play at love out here in this wild West. He said there\n",
      "would be blood shed over you. I begin to realize what he meant. He's\n",
      "not sorry for what he did. Think how strange that is. For he has the\n",
      "instincts of a gentleman. He's kind, gentle, chivalrous. Evidently he\n",
      "had tried every way to win your favor except any familiar advance. He\n",
      "did that as a last resort. In my opinion his motives were to force you\n",
      "to accept or refuse him, and in case you refused him he'd always have\n",
      "those forbidden stolen kisses to assuage his self-respect--when he\n",

      "\n",
      "When spring came at last and the willows drooped green and fresh over\n",
      "the brook and the range rang with bray of burro and whistle of stallion,\n",
      "old Al Auchincloss had been a month in his grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen it seemed longer. The month had been crowded with work, events,\n",
      "and growing, more hopeful duties, so that it contained a world\n",
      "of living. The uncle had not been forgotten, but the innumerable\n",
      "restrictions to development and progress were no longer manifest.\n",
      "Beasley had not presented himself or any claim upon Helen; and she,\n",
      "gathering confidence day by day, began to believe all that purport of\n",
      "trouble had been exaggerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this time she had come to love her work and all that pertained to it.\n",
      "The estate was large. She had no accurate knowledge of how many acres\n",
      "she owned, but it was more than two thousand. The fine, old, rambling\n",
      "ranch-house, set like a fort on the last of the foot-hills, corrals and\n",
      "fields and barns and meadows, and the rolling green range beyond, and\n",
      "innumerable sheep, horses, cattle--all these belonged to Helen, to her\n",
      "ever-wondering realization and ever-growing joy. Still, she was afraid\n",
      "to let herself go and be perfectly happy. Always there was the fear that\n",
      "had been too deep and strong to forget so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bright, fresh morning, in March, Helen came out upon the porch to\n",
      "revel a little in the warmth of sunshine and the crisp, pine-scented\n",
      "wind that swept down from the mountains. There was never a morning that\n",
      "she did not gaze mountainward, trying to see, with a folly she realized,\n",
      "if the snow had melted more perceptibly away on the bold white ridge.\n",
      "For all she could see it had not melted an inch, and she would\n",
      "not confess why she sighed. The desert had become green and fresh,\n",
      "stretching away there far below her range, growing dark and purple in\n",
      "the distance with vague buttes rising. The air was full of sound--notes\n",
      "of blackbirds and the baas of sheep, and blasts from the corrals, and\n",
      "the clatter of light hoofs on the court below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was riding in from the stables. Helen loved to watch her on one of\n",
      "those fiery little mustangs, but the sight was likewise given to rousing\n",
      "apprehensions. This morning Bo appeared particularly bent on frightening\n",
      "Helen. Down the lane Carmichael appeared, waving his arms, and Helen\n",
      "at once connected him with Bo's manifest desire to fly away from that\n",
      "particular place. Since that day, a month back, when Bo had confessed\n",
      "her love for Carmichael, she and Helen had not spoken of it or of the\n",
      "cowboy. The boy and girl were still at odds. But this did not worry\n",
      "Helen. Bo had changed much for the better, especially in that she\n",
      "devoted herself to Helen and to her work. Helen knew that all would\n",
      "turn out well in the end, and so she had been careful of her rather\n",
      "precarious position between these two young firebrands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo reined in the mustang at the porch steps. She wore a buckskin\n",
      "riding-suit which she had made herself, and its soft gray with the\n",
      "touches of red beads was mightily becoming to her. Then she had grown\n",
      "considerably during the winter and now looked too flashing and pretty to\n",
      "resemble a boy, yet singularly healthy and strong and lithe. Red spots\n",
      "shone in her cheeks and her eyes held that ever-dangerous blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, did you give me away to that cowboy?” she demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give you away!” exclaimed Helen, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. You know I told you--awhile back--that I was wildly in love with\n",
      "him. Did you give me away--tell on me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She might have been furious, but she certainly was not confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Bo! How could you? No. I did not,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never gave him a hint?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not even a hint. You have my word for that. Why? What's happened?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He makes me sick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo would not say any more, owing to the near approach of the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mawnin', Miss Nell,” he drawled. “I was just tellin' this here Miss\n",
      "Bo-Peep Rayner--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't call me that!” broke in Bo, with fire in her voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I was just tellin' her thet she wasn't goin' off on any more of\n",
      "them long rides. Honest now, Miss Nell, it ain't safe, an'--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're not my boss,” retorted Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sister, I agree with him. You won't obey me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon some one's got to be your boss,” drawled Carmichael. “Shore I\n",
      "ain't hankerin' for the job. You could ride to Kingdom Come or off among\n",
      "the Apaches--or over here a ways”--at this he grinned knowingly--“or\n",
      "anywheres, for all I cared. But I'm workin' for Miss Nell, an' she's\n",
      "boss. An' if she says you're not to take them rides--you won't. Savvy\n",
      "that, miss?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a treat for Helen to see Bo look at the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mis-ter Carmichael, may I ask how you are going to prevent me from\n",
      "riding where I like?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if you're goin' worse locoed this way I'll keep you off'n a hoss\n",
      "if I have to rope you an' tie you up. By golly, I will!”\n",
      "\n",
      "His dry humor was gone and manifestly he meant what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal,” she drawled it very softly and sweetly, but venomously,\n",
      "“if--you--ever--touch--me again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this he flushed, then made a quick, passionate gesture with his hand,\n",
      "expressive of heat and shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You an' me will never get along,” he said, with a dignity full of\n",
      "pathos. “I seen thet a month back when you changed sudden-like to me.\n",
      "But nothin' I say to you has any reckonin' of mine. I'm talkin' for your\n",
      "sister. It's for her sake. An' your own.... I never told her an' I never\n",
      "told you thet I've seen Riggs sneakin' after you twice on them desert\n",
      "rides. Wal, I tell you now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The intelligence apparently had not the slightest effect on Bo. But\n",
      "Helen was astonished and alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs! Oh, Bo, I've seen him myself--riding around. He does not mean\n",
      "well. You must be careful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I ketch him again,” went on Carmichael, with his mouth lining hard,\n",
      "“I'm goin' after him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave her a cool, intent, piercing look, then he dropped his head and\n",
      "turned away, to stride back toward the corrals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could make little of the manner in which her sister watched the\n",
      "cowboy pass out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A month back--when I changed sudden-like,” mused Bo. “I wonder what he\n",
      "meant by that.... Nell, did I change--right after the talk you had with\n",
      "me--about him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed you did, Bo,” replied Helen. “But it was for the better. Only\n",
      "he can't see it. How proud and sensitive he is! You wouldn't guess it\n",
      "at first. Bo, your reserve has wounded him more than your flirting. He\n",
      "thinks it's indifference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe that 'll be good for him,” declared Bo. “Does he expect me to\n",
      "fall on his neck? He's that thick-headed! Why, he's the locoed one, not\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd like to ask you, Bo, if you've seen how he has changed?” queried\n",
      "Helen, earnestly. “He's older. He's worried. Either his heart is\n",
      "breaking for you or else he fears trouble for us. I fear it's both. How\n",
      "he watches you! Bo, he knows all you do--where you go. That about Riggs\n",
      "sickens me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Riggs follows me and tries any of his four-flush desperado games\n",
      "he'll have his hands full,” said Bo, grimly. “And that without my cowboy\n",
      "protector! But I just wish Riggs would do something. Then we'll see what\n",
      "Las Vegas Tom Carmichael cares. Then we'll see!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo bit out the last words passionately and jealously, then she lifted\n",
      "her bridle to the spirited mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, don't you fear for me,” she said. “I can take care of myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen watched her ride away, all but willing to confess that there\n",
      "might be truth in what Bo said. Then Helen went about her work, which\n",
      "consisted of routine duties as well as an earnest study to familiarize\n",
      "herself with continually new and complex conditions of ranch life. Every\n",
      "day brought new problems. She made notes of all that she observed, and\n",
      "all that was told her, which habit she had found, after a few weeks of\n",
      "trial, was going to be exceedingly valuable to her. She did not intend\n",
      "always to be dependent upon the knowledge of hired men, however faithful\n",
      "some of them might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning on her rounds she had expected developments of some kind,\n",
      "owing to the presence of Roy Beeman and two of his brothers, who had\n",
      "arrived yesterday. And she was to discover that Jeff Mulvey, accompanied\n",
      "by six of his co-workers and associates, had deserted her without a word\n",
      "or even sending for their pay. Carmichael had predicted this. Helen had\n",
      "half doubted. It was a relief now to be confronted with facts, however\n",
      "disturbing. She had fortified herself to withstand a great deal more\n",
      "trouble than had happened. At the gateway of the main corral, a huge\n",
      "inclosure fenced high with peeled logs, she met Roy Beeman, lasso in\n",
      "hand, the same tall, lean, limping figure she remembered so well.\n",
      "Sight of him gave her an inexplicable thrill--a flashing memory of an\n",
      "unforgettable night ride. Roy was to have charge of the horses on the\n",
      "ranch, of which there were several hundred, not counting many lost on\n",
      "range and mountain, or the unbranded colts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy took off his sombrero and greeted her. This Mormon had a courtesy\n",
      "for women that spoke well for him. Helen wished she had more employees\n",
      "like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's jest as Las Vegas told us it 'd be,” he said, regretfully. “Mulvey\n",
      "an' his pards lit out this mornin'. I'm sorry, Miss Helen. Reckon thet's\n",
      "all because I come over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard the news,” replied Helen. “You needn't be sorry, Roy, for I'm\n",
      "not. I'm glad. I want to know whom I can trust.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas says we're shore in for it now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, what do you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon so. Still, Las Vegas is powerful cross these days an' always\n",
      "lookin' on the dark side. With us boys, now, it's sufficient unto the\n",
      "day is the evil thereof. But, Miss Helen, if Beasley forces the deal\n",
      "there will be serious trouble. I've seen thet happen. Four or five years\n",
      "ago Beasley rode some greasers off their farms an' no one ever knowed if\n",
      "he had a just claim.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley has no claim on my property. My uncle solemnly swore that on\n",
      "his death-bed. And I find nothing in his books or papers of those years\n",
      "when he employed Beasley. In fact, Beasley was never uncle's partner.\n",
      "The truth is that my uncle took Beasley up when he was a poor, homeless\n",
      "boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So my old dad says,” replied Roy. “But what's right don't always\n",
      "prevail in these parts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, you're the keenest man I've met since I came West. Tell me what\n",
      "you think will happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beeman appeared flattered, but he hesitated to reply. Helen had long\n",
      "been aware of the reticence of these outdoor men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you mean cause an' effect, as Milt Dale would say,” responded\n",
      "Roy, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. If Beasley attempts to force me off my ranch what will happen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy looked up and met her gaze. Helen remembered that singular\n",
      "stillness, intentness of his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if Dale an' John get here in time I reckon we can bluff thet\n",
      "Beasley outfit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean my friends--my men would confront Beasley--refuse his\n",
      "demands--and if necessary fight him off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shore do,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But suppose you're not all here? Beasley would be smart enough to\n",
      "choose an opportune time. Suppose he did put me off and take possession?\n",
      "What then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it 'd only be a matter of how soon Dale or Carmichael--or I--got\n",
      "to Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy! I feared just that. It haunts me. Carmichael asked me to let him\n",
      "go pick a fight with Beasley. Asked me, just as he would ask me about\n",
      "his work! I was shocked. And now you say Dale--and you--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen choked in her agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, what else could you look for? Las Vegas is in love with\n",
      "Miss Bo. Shore he told me so. An' Dale's in love with you!... Why, you\n",
      "couldn't stop them any more 'n you could stop the wind from blowin' down\n",
      "a pine, when it got ready.... Now, it's some different with me. I'm a\n",
      "Mormon an' I'm married. But I'm Dale's pard, these many years. An'\n",
      "I care a powerful sight for you an' Miss Bo. So I reckon I'd draw on\n",
      "Beasley the first chance I got.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen strove for utterance, but it was denied her. Roy's simple\n",
      "statement of Dale's love had magnified her emotion by completely\n",
      "changing its direction. She forgot what she had felt wretched about. She\n",
      "could not look at Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, don't feel bad,” he said, kindly. “Shore you're not to\n",
      "blame. Your comin' West hasn't made any difference in Beasley's fate,\n",
      "except mebbe to hurry it a little. My dad is old, an' when he talks\n",
      "it's like history. He looks back on happenin's. Wal, it's the nature of\n",
      "happenin's that Beasley passes away before his prime. Them of his breed\n",
      "don't live old in the West.... So I reckon you needn't feel bad or\n",
      "worry. You've got friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen incoherently thanked him, and, forgetting her usual round of\n",
      "corrals and stables, she hurried back toward the house, deeply stirred,\n",
      "throbbing and dim-eyed, with a feeling she could not control. Roy Beeman\n",
      "had made a statement that had upset her equilibrium. It seemed simple\n",
      "and natural, yet momentous and staggering. To hear that Dale loved\n",
      "her--to hear it spoken frankly, earnestly, by Dale's best friend, was\n",
      "strange, sweet, terrifying. But was it true? Her own consciousness had\n",
      "admitted it. Yet that was vastly different from a man's open statement.\n",
      "No longer was it a dear dream, a secret that seemed hers alone. How she\n",
      "had lived on that secret hidden deep in her breast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Something burned the dimness from her eyes as she looked toward the\n",
      "mountains and her sight became clear, telescopic with its intensity.\n",
      "Magnificently the mountains loomed. Black inroads and patches on the\n",
      "slopes showed where a few days back all bad been white. The snow was\n",
      "melting fast. Dale would soon be free to ride down to Pine. And that was\n",
      "an event Helen prayed for, yet feared as she had never feared anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The noonday dinner-bell startled Helen from a reverie that was a\n",
      "pleasant aftermath of her unrestraint. How the hours had flown! This\n",
      "morning at least must be credited to indolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was not in the dining-room, nor in her own room, nor was she in\n",
      "sight from window or door. This absence had occurred before, but not\n",
      "particularly to disturb Helen. In this instance, however, she grew\n",
      "worried. Her nerves presaged strain. There was an overcharge of\n",
      "sensibility in her feelings or a strange pressure in the very\n",
      "atmosphere. She ate dinner alone, looking her apprehension, which was\n",
      "not mitigated by the expressive fears of old Maria, the Mexican woman\n",
      "who served her.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner she sent word to Roy and Carmichael that they had better\n",
      "ride out to look for Bo. Then Helen applied herself resolutely to her\n",
      "books until a rapid clatter of hoofs out in the court caused her to jump\n",
      "up and hurry to the porch. Roy was riding in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you find her?” queried Helen, hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't no track or sign of her up the north range,” replied Roy, as he\n",
      "dismounted and threw his bridle. “An' I was ridin' back to take up her\n",
      "tracks from the corral an' trail her. But I seen Las Vegas comin' an' he\n",
      "waved his sombrero. He was comin' up from the south. There he is now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael appeared swinging into the lane. He was mounted on Helen's\n",
      "big black Ranger, and he made the dust fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, he's seen her, thet's shore,” vouchsafed Roy, with relief, as\n",
      "Carmichael rode up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, she's comin',” said the cowboy, as he reined in and\n",
      "slid down with his graceful single motion. Then in a violent action,\n",
      "characteristic of him, he slammed his sombrero down on the porch and\n",
      "threw up both arms. “I've a hunch it's come off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, what?” exclaimed Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Las Vegas, talk sense,” expostulated Roy. “Miss Helen is shore\n",
      "nervous to-day. Has anythin' happened?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon, but I don't know what,” replied Carmichael, drawing a long\n",
      "breath. “Folks, I must be gettin' old. For I shore felt orful queer till\n",
      "I seen Bo. She was ridin' down the ridge across the valley. Ridin' some\n",
      "fast, too, an' she'll be here right off, if she doesn't stop in the\n",
      "village.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I hear her comin' now,” said Roy. “An'--if you asked me I'd say\n",
      "she WAS ridin' some fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen heard the light, swift, rhythmic beat of hoofs, and then out on\n",
      "the curve of the road that led down to Pine she saw Bo's mustang, white\n",
      "with lather, coming on a dead run.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, do you see any Apaches?” asked Roy, quizzingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy made no reply, but he strode out from the porch, directly\n",
      "in front of the mustang. Bo was pulling hard on the bridle, and had him\n",
      "slowing down, but not controlled. When he reached the house it could\n",
      "easily be seen that Bo had pulled him to the limit of her strength,\n",
      "which was not enough to halt him. Carmichael lunged for the bridle and,\n",
      "seizing it, hauled him to a standstill.\n",
      "\n",
      "At close sight of Bo Helen uttered a startled cry. Bo was white; her\n",
      "sombrero was gone and her hair undone; there were blood and dirt on\n",
      "her face, and her riding-suit was torn and muddy. She had evidently\n",
      "sustained a fall. Roy gazed at her in admiring consternation, but\n",
      "Carmichael never looked at her at all. Apparently he was examining the\n",
      "horse. “Well, help me off--somebody,” cried Bo, peremptorily. Her voice\n",
      "was weak, but not her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy sprang to help her off, and when she was down it developed that she\n",
      "was lame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Bo! You've had a tumble,” exclaimed Helen, anxiously, and she ran\n",
      "to assist Roy. They led her up the porch and to the door. There she\n",
      "turned to look at Carmichael, who was still examining the spent mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell him--to come in,” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey, there, Las Vegas!” called Roy. “Rustle hyar, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Bo had been led into the sitting-room and seated in a chair\n",
      "Carmichael entered. His face was a study, as slowly he walked up to Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girl, you--ain't hurt?” he asked, huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's no fault of yours that I'm not crippled--or dead or worse,”\n",
      " retorted Bo. “You said the south range was the only safe ride for me.\n",
      "And there--I--it happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She panted a little and her bosom heaved. One of her gauntlets was gone,\n",
      "and the bare band, that was bruised and bloody, trembled as she held it\n",
      "out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear, tell us--are you badly hurt?” queried Helen, with hurried\n",
      "gentleness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not much. I've had a spill,” replied Bo. “But oh! I'm mad--I'm\n",
      "boiling!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked as if she might have exaggerated her doubt of injuries, but\n",
      "certainly she had not overestimated her state of mind. Any blaze Helen\n",
      "had heretofore seen in those quick eyes was tame compared to this one.\n",
      "It actually leaped. Bo was more than pretty then. Manifestly Roy was\n",
      "admiring her looks, but Carmichael saw beyond her charm. And slowly he\n",
      "was growing pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I rode out the south range--as I was told,” began Bo, breathing hard\n",
      "and trying to control her feelings. “That's the ride you usually take,\n",
      "Nell, and you bet--if you'd taken it to-day--you'd not be here now....\n",
      "About three miles out I climbed off the range up that cedar slope. I\n",
      "always keep to high ground. When I got up I saw two horsemen ride out\n",
      "of some broken rocks off to the east. They rode as if to come between me\n",
      "and home. I didn't like that. I circled south. About a mile farther on I\n",
      "spied another horseman and he showed up directly in front of me and came\n",
      "along slow. That I liked still less. It might have been accident, but it\n",
      "looked to me as if those riders had some intent. All I could do was head\n",
      "off to the southeast and ride. You bet I did ride. But I got into rough\n",
      "ground where I'd never been before. It was slow going. At last I made\n",
      "the cedars and here I cut loose, believing I could circle ahead of those\n",
      "strange riders and come round through Pine. I had it wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here she hesitated, perhaps for breath, for she had spoken rapidly, or\n",
      "perhaps to get better hold on her subject. Not improbably the effect she\n",
      "was creating on her listeners began to be significant. Roy sat absorbed,\n",
      "perfectly motionless, eyes keen as steel, his mouth open. Carmichael\n",
      "was gazing over Bo's head, out of the window, and it seemed that he\n",
      "must know the rest of her narrative. Helen knew that her own wide-eyed\n",
      "attention alone would have been all-compelling inspiration to Bo Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure I had it wrong,” resumed Bo. “Pretty soon heard a horse behind. I\n",
      "looked back. I saw a big bay riding down on me. Oh, but he was running!\n",
      "He just tore through the cedars. ... I was scared half out of my senses.\n",
      "But I spurred and beat my mustang. Then began a race! Rough going--thick\n",
      "cedars--washes and gullies I had to make him run--to keep my saddle--to\n",
      "pick my way. Oh-h-h! but it was glorious! To race for fun--that's\n",
      "one thing; to race for your life is another! My heart was in my\n",
      "mouth--choking me. I couldn't have yelled. I was as cold as ice--dizzy\n",
      "sometimes--blind others--then my stomach turned--and I couldn't get my\n",
      "breath. Yet the wild thrills I had!... But I stuck on and held my own\n",
      "for several miles--to the edge of the cedars. There the big horse gained\n",
      "on me. He came pounding closer--perhaps as close as a hundred yards--I\n",
      "could hear him plain enough. Then I had my spill. Oh, my mustang\n",
      "tripped--threw me 'way over his head. I hit light, but slid far--and\n",
      "that's what scraped me so. I know my knee is raw.... When I got to my\n",
      "feet the big horse dashed up, throwing gravel all over me--and his rider\n",
      "jumped off.... Now who do you think he was?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen knew, but she did not voice her conviction. Carmichael knew\n",
      "positively, yet he kept silent. Roy was smiling, as if the narrative\n",
      "told did not seem so alarming to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, the fact of you bein' here, safe an' sound, sorta makes no\n",
      "difference who thet son-of-a-gun was,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs! Harve Riggs!” blazed Bo. “The instant I recognized him I got\n",
      "over my scare. And so mad I burned all through like fire. I don't know\n",
      "what I said, but it was wild--and it was a whole lot, you bet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You sure can ride,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I demanded why he had dared to chase me, and he said he had an\n",
      "important message for Nell. This was it: 'Tell your sister that Beasley\n",
      "means to put her off an' take the ranch. If she'll marry me I'll block\n",
      "his deal. If she won't marry me, I'll go in with Beasley.' Then he told\n",
      "me to hurry home and not to breathe a word to any one except Nell. Well,\n",
      "here I am--and I seem to have been breathing rather fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked from Helen to Roy and from Roy to Las Vegas. Her smile was\n",
      "for the latter, and to any one not overexcited by her story that smile\n",
      "would have told volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I'll be doggoned!” ejaculated Roy, feelingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, the working of that man's mind is beyond me.... Marry him to\n",
      "save my ranch? I wouldn't marry him to save my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael suddenly broke his silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, did you see the other men?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I was coming to that,” she replied. “I caught a glimpse of\n",
      "them back in the cedars. The three were together, or, at least, three\n",
      "horsemen were there. They had halted behind some trees. Then on the way\n",
      "home I began to think. Even in my fury I had received impressions. Riggs\n",
      "was SURPRISED when I got up. I'll bet he had not expected me to be who I\n",
      "was. He thought I was NELL!... I look bigger in this buckskin outfit. My\n",
      "hair was up till I lost my hat, and that was when I had the tumble. He\n",
      "took me for Nell. Another thing, I remember--he made some sign--some\n",
      "motion while I was calling him names, and I believe that was to keep\n",
      "those other men back.... I believe Riggs had a plan with those other men\n",
      "to waylay Nell and make off with her. I absolutely know it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, you're so--so--you jump at wild ideas so,” protested Helen, trying\n",
      "to believe in her own assurance. But inwardly she was trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, that ain't a wild idee,” said Roy, seriously. “I reckon\n",
      "your sister is pretty close on the trail. Las Vegas, don't you savvy it\n",
      "thet way?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael's answer was to stalk out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call him back!” cried Helen, apprehensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, boy!” called Roy, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen reached the door simultaneously with Roy. The cowboy picked up his\n",
      "sombrero, jammed it on his head, gave his belt a vicious hitch that made\n",
      "the gun-sheath jump, and then in one giant step he was astride Ranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael! Stay!” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy spurred the black, and the stones rang under iron-shod hoofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! Call him back! Please call him back!” importuned Helen, in\n",
      "distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won't,” declared Bo Rayner. Her face shone whiter now and her eyes\n",
      "were like fiery flint. That was her answer to a loving, gentle-hearted\n",
      "sister; that was her answer to the call of the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No use,” said Roy, quietly. “An' I reckon I'd better trail him up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He, too, strode out and, mounting his horse, galloped swiftly away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out that Bo, was more bruised and scraped and shaken than she\n",
      "had imagined. One knee was rather badly cut, which injury alone would\n",
      "have kept her from riding again very soon. Helen, who was somewhat\n",
      "skilled at bandaging wounds, worried a great deal over these sundry\n",
      "blotches on Bo's fair skin, and it took considerable time to wash and\n",
      "dress them. Long after this was done, and during the early supper, and\n",
      "afterward, Bo's excitement remained unabated. The whiteness stayed on\n",
      "her face and the blaze in her eyes. Helen ordered and begged her to go\n",
      "to bed, for the fact was Bo could not stand up and her hands shook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to bed? Not much,” she said. “I want to know what he does to Riggs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was that possibility which had Helen in dreadful suspense. If\n",
      "Carmichael killed Riggs, it seemed to Helen that the bottom would\n",
      "drop out of this structure of Western life she had begun to build so\n",
      "earnestly and fearfully. She did not believe that he would do so. But\n",
      "the uncertainty was torturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Bo,” appealed Helen, “you don't want--Oh! you do want Carmichael\n",
      "to--to kill Riggs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don't, but I wouldn't care if he did,” replied Bo, bluntly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you think--he will?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, if that cowboy really loves me he read my mind right here before\n",
      "he left,” declared Bo. “And he knew what I thought he'd do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what's--that?” faltered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want him to round Riggs up down in the village--somewhere in a crowd.\n",
      "I want Riggs shown up as the coward, braggart, four-flush that he is.\n",
      "And insulted, slapped, kicked--driven out of Pine!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her passionate speech still rang throughout the room when there came\n",
      "footsteps on the porch. Helen hurried to raise the bar from the door and\n",
      "open it just as a tap sounded on the door-post. Roy's face stood white\n",
      "out of the darkness. His eyes were bright. And his smile made Helen's\n",
      "fearful query needless.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you-all this evenin'?” he drawled, as he came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fire blazed on the hearth and a lamp burned on the table. By their\n",
      "light Bo looked white and eager-eyed as she reclined in the big\n",
      "arm-chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What 'd he do?” she asked, with all her amazing force.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, now, ain't you goin' to tell me how you are?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, I'm all bunged up. I ought to be in bed, but I just couldn't sleep\n",
      "till I hear what Las Vegas did. I'd forgive anything except him getting\n",
      "drunk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I shore can ease your mind on thet,” replied Roy. “He never drank\n",
      "a drop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy was distractingly slow about beginning the tale any child could have\n",
      "guessed he was eager to tell. For once the hard, intent quietness, the\n",
      "soul of labor, pain, and endurance so plain in his face was softened by\n",
      "pleasurable emotion. He poked at the burning logs with the toe of his\n",
      "boot. Helen observed that he had changed his boots and now wore no\n",
      "spurs. Then he had gone to his quarters after whatever had happened down\n",
      "in Pine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where IS he?” asked Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who? Riggs? Wal, I don't know. But I reckon he's somewhere out in the\n",
      "woods nursin' himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not Riggs. First tell me where HE is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, then, you must mean Las Vegas. I just left him down at the\n",
      "cabin. He was gettin' ready for bed, early as it is. All tired out he\n",
      "was an' thet white you wouldn't have knowed him. But he looked happy at\n",
      "thet, an' the last words he said, more to himself than to me, I reckon,\n",
      "was, 'I'm some locoed gent, but if she doesn't call me Tom now she's no\n",
      "good!'”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo actually clapped her hands, notwithstanding that one of them was\n",
      "bandaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call him Tom? I should smile I will,” she declared, in delight. “Hurry\n",
      "now--what 'd--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's shore powerful strange how he hates thet handle Las Vegas,” went\n",
      "on Roy, imperturbably.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, tell me what he did--what TOM did--or I'll scream,” cried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, did you ever see the likes of thet girl?” asked Roy,\n",
      "appealing to Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Roy, I never did,” agreed Helen. “But please--please tell us what\n",
      "has happened.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy grinned and rubbed his hands together in a dark delight, almost\n",
      "fiendish in its sudden revelation of a gulf of strange emotion deep\n",
      "within him. Whatever had happened to Riggs had not been too much for\n",
      "Roy Beeman. Helen remembered hearing her uncle say that a real Westerner\n",
      "hated nothing so hard as the swaggering desperado, the make-believe\n",
      "gunman who pretended to sail under the true, wild, and reckoning colors\n",
      "of the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy leaned his lithe, tall form against the stone mantelpiece and faced\n",
      "the girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I rode out after Las Vegas I seen him 'way down the road,” began\n",
      "Roy, rapidly. “An' I seen another man ridin' down into Pine from the\n",
      "other side. Thet was Riggs, only I didn't know it then. Las Vegas rode\n",
      "up to the store, where some fellars was hangin' round, an' he spoke to\n",
      "them. When I come up they was all headin' for Turner's saloon. I seen a\n",
      "dozen hosses hitched to the rails. Las Vegas rode on. But I got off at\n",
      "Turner's an' went in with the bunch. Whatever it was Las Vegas said\n",
      "to them fellars, shore they didn't give him away. Pretty soon more men\n",
      "strolled into Turner's an' there got to be 'most twenty altogether, I\n",
      "reckon. Jeff Mulvey was there with his pards. They had been drinkin'\n",
      "sorta free. An' I didn't like the way Mulvey watched me. So I went\n",
      "out an' into the store, but kept a-lookin' for Las Vegas. He wasn't in\n",
      "sight. But I seen Riggs ridin' up. Now, Turner's is where Riggs hangs\n",
      "out an' does his braggin'. He looked powerful deep an' thoughtful,\n",
      "dismounted slow without seein' the unusual number of hosses there, an'\n",
      "then he slouches into Turner's. No more 'n a minute after Las Vegas rode\n",
      "down there like a streak. An' just as quick he was off an' through thet\n",
      "door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy paused as if to gain force or to choose his words. His tale now\n",

      "listener.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before I got to Turner's door--an' thet was only a little ways--I heard\n",
      "Las Vegas yell. Did you ever hear him? Wal, he's got the wildest yell\n",
      "of any cow-puncher I ever beard. Quicklike I opened the door an' slipped\n",
      "in. There was Riggs an' Las Vegas alone in the center of the big saloon,\n",
      "with the crowd edgin' to the walls an' slidin' back of the bar. Riggs\n",
      "was whiter 'n a dead man. I didn't hear an' I don't know what Las Vegas\n",
      "yelled at him. But Riggs knew an' so did the gang. All of a sudden every\n",

      "\n",
      "“'The hell ye say! Who's she?' blustered Riggs, an' he began to take\n",
      "quick looks 'round. But he never moved a hand. There was somethin' tight\n",
      "about the way he stood. Las Vegas had both arms half out, stretched as\n",
      "if he meant to leap. But he wasn't. I never seen Las Vegas do thet, but\n",

      "\n",
      "“'You know. An' you threatened her an' her sister. Go for your gun,'\n",

      "\n",
      "“When he dropped his arms then I knowed there would be no gun-play. An'\n",

      "Now an' then I caught somethin' like low-down an' sneak an' four-flush\n",
      "an' long-haired skunk, but for the most part they was just the cussedest\n",
      "kind of names. An' Las Vegas spouted them till he was black in the face,\n",

      "\n",
      "For two days Bo was confined to her bed, suffering considerable pain,\n",
      "and subject to fever, during which she talked irrationally. Some of this\n",
      "talk afforded Helen as vast an amusement as she was certain it would\n",

      "\n",
      "The third day, however, Bo was better, and, refusing to remain in bed,\n",
      "she hobbled to the sitting-room, where she divided her time between\n",
      "staring out of the window toward the corrals and pestering Helen with\n",
      "questions she tried to make appear casual. But Helen saw through her\n",
      "case and was in a state of glee. What she hoped most for was that\n",
      "Carmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for Bo. It\n",
      "was that kind of treatment the young lady needed. And now was the great\n",
      "opportunity. Helen almost felt tempted to give the cowboy a hint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither this day, nor the next, however, did he put in an appearance\n",

      "going to take to a dance. Bo's face showed that her vanity could not\n",

      "it with being possible. Roy evidently was as penetrating as he was kind.\n",
      "He made a dry, casual little remark about the snow never melting on the\n",

      "despite all this style, he seemed more than usually the cool, easy,\n",
      "careless cowboy.\n",

      "calculated to floor Carmichael with the initial, half-promising, wholly\n",
      "mocking use of his name she had reckoned without cause. The cowboy\n",
      "received that greeting as if he had heard her use it a thousand times\n",
      "or had not heard it at all. Helen decided if he was acting a part he\n",
      "was certainly a clever actor. He puzzled her somewhat, but she liked his\n",

      "\n",
      "Helen was unutterably tickled. The effect of his speech upon Bo was\n",

      "detachment of self, the casual thing be apparently made out of his\n",
      "magnificent championship, was bewildering and humiliating to Bo. She\n",
      "sat silent for a moment or two while Helen tried to fit easily into\n",
      "the conversation. It was not likely that Bo would long be at a loss\n",
      "for words, and also it was immensely probable that with a flash of her\n",
      "wonderful spirit she would turn the tables on her perverse lover in a\n",

      "startled, hurt, wistful, and finally sweetly defiant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But--you told Riggs I was your girl!” Thus Bo unmasked her battery. And\n",

      "the conquest she had suddenly and amazingly found dear quite broke her\n",

      "Helen's gaze and left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Bo was not approachable from any direction. Helen found her\n",
      "a victim to a multiplicity of moods, ranging from woe to dire, dark\n",

      "sustained her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in the afternoon, at Helen's leisure hour, when she and Bo were in\n",
      "the sitting-room, horses tramped into the court and footsteps mounted\n",

      "And out in the court were several mounted horsemen. Helen's heart sank.\n",
      "This visit, indeed, had been foreshadowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afternoon, Miss Rayner,” said Beasley, doffing his sombrero. “I've\n",

      "\n",
      "Helen acknowledged his greeting while she thought rapidly. She might\n",
      "just as well see him and have that inevitable interview done with.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come in,” she said, and when he had entered she closed the door. “My\n",
      "sister, Mr. Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How d' you do, Miss?” said the rancher, in bluff, loud voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo acknowledged the introduction with a frigid little bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "At close range Beasley seemed a forceful personality as well as a rather\n",
      "handsome man of perhaps thirty-five, heavy of build, swarthy of skin,\n",
      "and sloe-black of eye, like that of the Mexicans whose blood was\n",
      "reported to be in him. He looked crafty, confident, and self-centered.\n",
      "If Helen had never heard of him before that visit she would have\n",
      "distrusted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd called sooner, but I was waitin' for old Jose, the Mexican who\n",
      "herded for me when I was pardner to your uncle,” said Beasley, and he\n",
      "sat down to put his huge gloved hands on his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes?” queried Helen, interrogatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jose rustled over from Magdalena, an' now I can back up my claim....\n",
      "Miss Rayner, this hyar ranch ought to be mine an' is mine. It wasn't so\n",
      "big or so well stocked when Al Auchincloss beat me out of it. I reckon\n",
      "I'll allow for thet. I've papers, an' old Jose for witness. An' I\n",
      "calculate you'll pay me eighty thousand dollars, or else I'll take over\n",
      "the ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley spoke in an ordinary, matter-of-fact tone that certainly seemed\n",
      "sincere, and his manner was blunt, but perfectly natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Beasley, your claim is no news to me,” responded Helen, quietly.\n",
      "“I've heard about it. And I questioned my uncle. He swore on his\n",
      "death-bed that he did not owe you a dollar. Indeed, he claimed the\n",
      "indebtedness was yours to him. I could find nothing in his papers, so I\n",
      "must repudiate your claim. I will not take it seriously.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Rayner, I can't blame you for takin' Al's word against mine,” said\n",
      "Beasley. “An' your stand is natural. But you're a stranger here an' you\n",
      "know nothin' of stock deals in these ranges. It ain't fair to speak\n",
      "bad of the dead, but the truth is thet Al Auchincloss got his start by\n",
      "stealin' sheep an' unbranded cattle. Thet was the start of every rancher\n",
      "I know. It was mine. An' we none of us ever thought of it as rustlin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could only stare her surprise and doubt at this statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talk's cheap anywhere, an' in the West talk ain't much at all,”\n",
      " continued Beasley. “I'm no talker. I jest want to tell my case an' make\n",
      "a deal if you'll have it. I can prove more in black an' white, an' with\n",
      "witness, than you can. Thet's my case. The deal I'd make is this....\n",
      "Let's marry an' settle a bad deal thet way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man's direct assumption, absolutely without a qualifying\n",
      "consideration for her woman's attitude, was amazing, ignorant, and base;\n",
      "but Helen was so well prepared for it that she hid her disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Mr. Beasley, but I can't accept your offer,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you take time an' consider?” he asked, spreading wide his huge\n",
      "gloved hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Absolutely no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley rose to his feet. He showed no disappointment or chagrin, but\n",
      "the bold pleasantness left his face, and, slight as that change was, it\n",
      "stripped him of the only redeeming quality he showed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet means I'll force you to pay me the eighty thousand or put you\n",
      "off,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Beasley, even if I owed you that, how could I raise so enormous a\n",
      "sum? I don't owe it. And I certainly won't be put off my property. You\n",
      "can't put me off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' why can't I?” he demanded, with lowering, dark gaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because your claim is dishonest. And I can prove it,” declared Helen,\n",
      "forcibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who 're you goin' to prove it to--thet I'm dishonest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To my men--to your men--to the people of Pine--to everybody. There's\n",
      "not a person who won't believe me.”\n",

      "He seemed curious, discomfited, surlily annoyed, and yet fascinated\n",
      "by her statement or else by the quality and appearance of her as she\n",
      "spiritedly defended her cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' how 're you goin' to prove all thet?” he growled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Beasley, do you remember last fall when you met Snake Anson with\n",
      "his gang up in the woods--and hired him to make off with me?” asked\n",
      "Helen, in swift, ringing words.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark olive of Beasley's bold face shaded to a dirty white.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wha-at?” he jerked out, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see you remember. Well, Milt Dale was hidden in the loft of that\n",
      "cabin where you met Anson. He heard every word of your deal with the\n",
      "outlaw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley swung his arm in sudden violence, so hard that he flung his\n",
      "glove to the floor. As he stooped to snatch it up he uttered a sibilant\n",
      "hiss. Then, stalking to the door, he jerked it open, and slammed it\n",
      "behind him. His loud voice, hoarse with passion, preceded the scrape and\n",
      "crack of hoofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after supper that day, when Helen was just recovering her\n",
      "composure, Carmichael presented himself at the open door. Bo was not\n",
      "there. In the dimming twilight Helen saw that the cowboy was pale,\n",
      "somber, grim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, what's happened?” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy's been shot. It come off in Turner's saloon But he ain't dead. We\n",
      "packed him over to Widow Cass's. An' he said for me to tell you he'd\n",
      "pull through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shot! Pull through!” repeated Helen, in slow, unrealizing exclamation.\n",
      "She was conscious of a deep internal tumult and a cold checking of blood\n",
      "in all her external body.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, shot,” replied Carmichael, fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An', whatever he says, I reckon he won't pull through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Heaven, how terrible!” burst out Helen. “He was so good--such a\n",
      "man! What a pity! Oh, he must have met that in my behalf. Tell me, what\n",
      "happened? Who shot him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I don't know. An' thet's what's made me hoppin' mad. I wasn't\n",
      "there when it come off. An' he won't tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't know thet, either. I reckoned first it was because he wanted\n",
      "to get even. But, after thinkin' it over, I guess he doesn't want me\n",
      "lookin' up any one right now for fear I might get hurt. An' you're goin'\n",
      "to need your friends. Thet's all I can make of Roy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Helen hurriedly related the event of Beasley's call on her that\n",
      "afternoon and all that had occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, the half-breed son-of-a-greaser!” ejaculated Carmichael, in utter\n",
      "confoundment. “He wanted you to marry him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He certainly did. I must say it was a--a rather abrupt proposal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael appeared to be laboring with speech that had to be smothered\n",
      "behind his teeth. At last he let out an explosive breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, I've shore felt in my bones thet I'm the boy slated to brand\n",
      "thet big bull.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he must have shot Roy. He left here in a rage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon you can coax it out of Roy. Fact is, all I could learn was\n",
      "thet Roy come in the saloon alone. Beasley was there, an' Riggs--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs!” interrupted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, Riggs. He come back again. But he'd better keep out of my\n",
      "way.... An' Jeff Mulvey with his outfit. Turner told me he heard an\n",
      "argument an' then a shot. The gang cleared out, leavin' Roy on the\n",
      "floor. I come in a little later. Roy was still layin' there. Nobody was\n",
      "doin' anythin' for him. An' nobody had. I hold that against Turner. Wal,\n",
      "I got help an' packed Roy over to Widow Cass's. Roy seemed all right.\n",
      "But he was too bright an' talky to suit me. The bullet hit his lung,\n",
      "thet's shore. An' he lost a sight of blood before we stopped it. Thet\n",
      "skunk Turner might have lent a hand. An' if Roy croaks I reckon I'll--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, why must you always be reckoning to kill somebody?” demanded\n",
      "Helen, angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Cause somebody's got to be killed 'round here. Thet's why!” he snapped\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even so--should you risk leaving Bo and me without a friend?” asked\n",
      "Helen, reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that Carmichael wavered and lost something of his sullen deadliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Miss Nell, I'm only mad. If you'll just be patient with me--an'\n",
      "mebbe coax me.... But I can't see no other way out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let's hope and pray,” said Helen, earnestly. “You spoke of my coaxing\n",
      "Roy to tell who shot him. When can I see him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To-morrow, I reckon. I'll come for you. Fetch Bo along with you. We've\n",

      "here at the ranch-house?”\n",
      "\n",

      "you pale an' scared like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "About ten o'clock next morning Carmichael drove Helen and Bo into Pine,\n",
      "and tied up the team before Widow Cass's cottage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peach and apple-trees were mingling blossoms of pink and white; a\n",
      "drowsy hum of bees filled the fragrant air; rich, dark-green alfalfa\n",
      "covered the small orchard flat; a wood fire sent up a lazy column of\n",
      "blue smoke; and birds were singing sweetly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen could scarcely believe that amid all this tranquillity a man\n",
      "lay perhaps fatally injured. Assuredly Carmichael had been somber and\n",
      "reticent enough to rouse the gravest fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Widow Cass appeared on the little porch, a gray, bent, worn, but\n",

      "CHAPTER XIX\n",
      "\n",
      "The memory of a woman had ruined Milt Dale's peace, had confounded his\n",
      "philosophy of self-sufficient, lonely happiness in the solitude of the\n",
      "wilds, had forced him to come face to face with his soul and the fatal\n",
      "significance of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he realized his defeat, that things were not as they seemed, that\n",
      "there was no joy for him in the coming of spring, that he had been blind\n",
      "in his free, sensorial, Indian relation to existence, he fell into\n",
      "an inexplicably strange state, a despondency, a gloom as deep as the\n",
      "silence of his home. Dale reflected that the stronger an animal, the\n",
      "keener its nerves, the higher its intelligence, the greater must be its\n",
      "suffering under restraint or injury. He thought of himself as a high\n",
      "order of animal whose great physical need was action, and now the\n",
      "incentive to action seemed dead. He grew lax. He did not want to move.\n",
      "He performed his diminishing duties under compulsion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched for spring as a liberation, but not that he could leave the\n",
      "valley. He hated the cold, he grew weary of wind and snow; he imagined\n",
      "the warm sun, the park once more green with grass and bright with\n",
      "daisies, the return of birds and squirrels and deer to heir old haunts,\n",
      "would be the means whereby he could break this spell upon him. Then he\n",
      "might gradually return to past contentment, though it would never be the\n",
      "same.\n",
      "\n",
      "But spring, coming early to Paradise Park, brought a fever to Dale's\n",
      "blood--a fire of unutterable longing. It was good, perhaps, that\n",
      "this was so, because he seemed driven to work, climb, tramp, and keep\n",
      "ceaselessly on the move from dawn till dark. Action strengthened his lax\n",
      "muscles and kept him from those motionless, senseless hours of brooding.\n",
      "He at least need not be ashamed of longing for that which could never\n",
      "be his--the sweetness of a woman--a home full of light, joy, hope, the\n",
      "meaning and beauty of children. But those dark moods were sinkings into\n",
      "a pit of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had not kept track of days and weeks. He did not know when the snow\n",
      "melted off three slopes of Paradise Park. All he knew was that an age\n",
      "had dragged over his head and that spring had come. During his restless\n",
      "waking hours, and even when he was asleep, there seemed always in the\n",
      "back of his mind a growing consciousness that soon he would emerge from\n",
      "this trial, a changed man, ready to sacrifice his chosen lot, to give up\n",
      "his lonely life of selfish indulgence in lazy affinity with nature,\n",
      "and to go wherever his strong hands might perform some real service\n",
      "to people. Nevertheless, he wanted to linger in this mountain fastness\n",
      "until his ordeal was over--until he could meet her, and the world,\n",
      "knowing himself more of a man than ever before.\n",
      "\n",
      "One bright morning, while he was at his camp-fire, the tame cougar gave\n",
      "a low, growling warning. Dale was startled. Tom did not act like that\n",
      "because of a prowling grizzly or a straying stag. Presently Dale espied\n",
      "a horseman riding slowly out of the straggling spruces. And with that\n",
      "sight Dale's heart gave a leap, recalling to him a divination of his\n",
      "future relation to his kind. Never had he been so glad to see a man!\n",
      "\n",
      "This visitor resembled one of the Beemans, judging from the way he sat\n",
      "his horse, and presently Dale recognized him to be John.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture the jaded horse was spurred into a trot, soon reaching\n",
      "the pines and the camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, there, you ole b'ar-hunter!” called John, waving his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all his hearty greeting his appearance checked a like response from\n",
      "Dale. The horse was mud to his flanks and John was mud to his knees,\n",
      "wet, bedraggled, worn, and white. This hue of his face meant more than\n",
      "fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, John?” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "They shook hands. John wearily swung his leg over the pommel, but did\n",
      "not at once dismount. His clear gray eyes were wonderingly riveted upon\n",
      "the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt--what 'n hell's wrong?” he queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Do I look sick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I should smile. Thin an' pale an' down in the mouth! Milt, what\n",

      "“Lung trouble!” ejaculated John. “With thet chest, an' up in this\n",
      "air?... Get out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No--not lung trouble,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What kind of a hunch?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Easy now, Dale, ole man.... Don't you reckon I'm ridin' in on you\n",
      "pretty early? Look at thet hoss!” John slid off and waved a hand at\n",
      "the drooping beast, then began to unsaddle him. “Wal, he done great. We\n",
      "bogged some comin' over. An' I climbed the pass at night on the frozen\n",
      "snow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're welcome as the flowers in May. John, what month is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By spades! are you as bad as thet?... Let's see. It's the twenty-third\n",
      "of March.”\n",

      "“March! Well, I'm beat. I've lost my reckonin'--an' a lot more, maybe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thar!” declared John, slapping the mustang. “You can jest hang up here\n",
      "till my next trip. Milt, how 're your hosses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wintered fine.”\n",

      "“Wal, thet's good. We'll need two big, strong hosses right off.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“You're goin' to ride down to Pine with me--thet's what for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Familiarly then came back to Dale the quiet, intent suggestiveness of\n",
      "the Beemans in moments foreboding trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this certain assurance of John's, too significant to be doubted,\n",

      "A tremor ran all through Dale. It seemed another painful yet thrilling\n",
      "connection between his past and this vaguely calling future. His\n",
      "emotions had been broodings dreams, longings. This thing his friend said\n",
      "had the sting of real life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then old Al's dead?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Long ago--I reckon around the middle of February. The property went to\n",
      "Helen. She's been doin' fine. An' many folks say it's a pity she'll lose\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She won't lose it,” declared Dale. How strange his voice sounded to his\n",
      "own ears! It was hoarse and unreal, as if from disuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, we-all have our idees. I say she will. My father says so.\n",
      "Carmichael says so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon you remember thet cow-puncher who came up with Roy an'\n",
      "Auchincloss after the girls--last fall?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. They called him Las--Las Vegas. I liked his looks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! You'll like him a heap when you know him. He's kept the ranch\n",
      "goin' for Miss Helen all along. But the deal's comin' to a head.\n",
      "Beasley's got thick with thet Riggs. You remember him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, he's been hangin' out at Pine all winter, watchin' for some chance\n",
      "to get at Miss Helen or Bo. Everybody's seen thet. An' jest lately he\n",
      "chased Bo on hossback--gave the kid a nasty fall. Roy says Riggs was\n",
      "after Miss Helen. But I think one or t'other of the girls would do thet\n",
      "varmint. Wal, thet sorta started goin's-on. Carmichael beat Riggs an'\n",
      "drove him out of town. But he come back. Beasley called on Miss Helen\n",
      "an' offered to marry her so's not to take the ranch from her, he said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale awoke with a thundering curse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore!” exclaimed John. “I'd say the same--only I'm religious. Don't\n",
      "thet beady-eyed greaser's gall make you want to spit all over yourself?\n",
      "My Gawd! but Roy was mad! Roy's powerful fond of Miss Helen an' Bo....\n",
      "Wal, then, Roy, first chance he got, braced Beasley an' give him some\n",
      "straight talk. Beasley was foamin' at the mouth, Roy said. It was then\n",
      "Riggs shot Roy. Shot him from behind Beasley when Roy wasn't lookin'!\n",
      "An' Riggs brags of bein' a gun-fighter. Mebbe thet wasn't a bad shot for\n",
      "him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon,” replied Dale, as he swallowed hard. “Now, just what was\n",
      "Roy's message to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I can't remember all Roy said,” answered John, dubiously. “But\n",
      "Roy shore was excited an' dead in earnest. He says: 'Tell Milt what's\n",
      "happened. Tell him Helen Rayner's in more danger than she was last fall.\n",
      "Tell him I've seen her look away acrost the mountains toward Paradise\n",
      "Park with her heart in her eyes. Tell him she needs him most of all!'”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook all over as with an attack of ague. He was seized by a\n",
      "whirlwind of passionate, terrible sweetness of sensation, when what\n",
      "he wildly wanted was to curse Roy and John for their simple-minded\n",
      "conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy's--crazy!” panted Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, now, Milt--thet's downright surprisin' of you. Roy's the\n",
      "level-headest of any fellars I know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man! if he MADE me believe him--an' it turned out untrue--I'd--I'd kill\n",
      "him,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Untrue! Do you think Roy Beeman would lie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, John--you fellows can't see my case. Nell Rayner wants me--needs\n",
      "me!... It can't be true!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, my love-sick pard--it jest IS true!” exclaimed John, feelingly.\n",
      "“Thet's the hell of life--never knowin'. But here it's joy for you. You\n",
      "can believe Roy Beeman about women as quick as you'd trust him to track\n",
      "your lost hoss. Roy's married three girls. I reckon he'll marry some\n",
      "more. Roy's only twenty-eight an' he has two big farms. He said he'd\n",
      "seen Nell Rayner's heart in her eyes, lookin' for you--an' you can jest\n",
      "bet your life thet's true. An' he said it because he means you to rustle\n",
      "down there an' fight for thet girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll--go,” said Dale, in a shaky whisper, as he sat down on a pine log\n",
      "near the fire. He stared unseeingly at the bluebells in the grass by his\n",
      "feet while storm after storm possessed his breast. They were fierce and\n",
      "brief because driven by his will. In those few moments of contending\n",
      "strife Dale was immeasurably removed from that dark gulf of self which\n",
      "had made his winter a nightmare. And when he stood erect again it seemed\n",
      "that the old earth had a stirring, electrifying impetus for his feet.\n",
      "Something black, bitter, melancholy, and morbid, always unreal to him,\n",
      "had passed away forever. The great moment had been forced upon him. He\n",
      "did not believe Roy Beeman's preposterous hint regarding Helen; but he\n",
      "had gone back or soared onward, as if by magic, to his old true self.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mounted on Dale's strongest horses, with only a light pack, an ax, and\n",
      "their weapons, the two men had reached the snow-line on the pass by noon\n",
      "that day. Tom, the tame cougar, trotted along in the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crust of the snow, now half thawed by the sun, would not hold\n",
      "the weight of a horse, though it upheld the men on foot. They walked,\n",
      "leading the horses. Travel was not difficult until the snow began to\n",
      "deepen; then progress slackened materially. John had not been able to\n",
      "pick out the line of the trail, so Dale did not follow his tracks. An\n",
      "old blaze on the trees enabled Dale to keep fairly well to the trail;\n",
      "and at length the height of the pass was reached, where the snow was\n",
      "deep. Here the horses labored, plowing through foot by foot. When,\n",
      "finally, they sank to their flanks, they had to be dragged and goaded\n",
      "on, and helped by thick flat bunches of spruce boughs placed under their\n",
      "hoofs. It took three hours of breaking toil to do the few hundred yards\n",
      "of deep snow on the height of the pass. The cougar did not have great\n",
      "difficulty in following, though it was evident he did not like such\n",
      "traveling.\n",
      "\n",
      "That behind them, the horses gathered heart and worked on to the edge\n",
      "of the steep descent, where they had all they could do to hold back from\n",
      "sliding and rolling. Fast time was made on this slope, at the bottom of\n",
      "which began a dense forest with snow still deep in places and windfalls\n",
      "hard to locate. The men here performed Herculean labors, but they got\n",
      "through to a park where the snow was gone. The ground, however, soft and\n",
      "boggy, in places was more treacherous than the snow; and the travelers\n",
      "had to skirt the edge of the park to a point opposite, and then go on\n",
      "through the forest. When they reached bare and solid ground, just before\n",
      "dark that night, it was high time, for the horses were ready to drop,\n",
      "and the men likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Camp was made in an open wood. Darkness fell and the men were resting\n",
      "on bough beds, feet to the fire, with Tom curled up close by, and the\n",
      "horses still drooping where they had been unsaddled. Morning, however,\n",
      "discovered them grazing on the long, bleached grass. John shook his head\n",
      "when he looked at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You reckoned to make Pine by nightfall. How far is it--the way you'll\n",
      "go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fifty mile or thereabouts,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, we can't ride it on them critters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, we'd do more than that if we had to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were saddled and on the move before sunrise, leaving snow and bog\n",
      "behind. Level parks and level forests led one after another to long\n",
      "slopes and steep descents, all growing sunnier and greener as the\n",
      "altitude diminished. Squirrels and grouse, turkeys and deer, and less\n",
      "tame denizens of the forest grew more abundant as the travel advanced.\n",
      "In this game zone, however, Dale had trouble with Tom. The cougar had to\n",
      "be watched and called often to keep him off of trails.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom doesn't like a long trip,” said Dale. “But I'm goin' to take him.\n",
      "Some way or other he may come in handy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sic him onto Beasley's gang,” replied John. “Some men are powerful\n",
      "scared of cougars. But I never was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor me. Though I've had cougars give me a darn uncanny feelin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The men talked but little. Dale led the way, with Tom trotting\n",
      "noiselessly beside his horse. John followed close behind. They loped the\n",
      "horses across parks, trotted through the forests, walked slow up\n",
      "what few inclines they met, and slid down the soft, wet, pine-matted\n",
      "descents. So they averaged from six to eight miles an hour. The horses\n",
      "held up well under that steady travel, and this without any rest at\n",
      "noon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale seemed to feel himself in an emotional trance. Yet, despite this,\n",
      "the same old sensorial perceptions crowded thick and fast upon him,\n",
      "strangely sweet and vivid after the past dead months when neither sun\n",
      "nor wind nor cloud nor scent of pine nor anything in nature could stir\n",
      "him. His mind, his heart, his soul seemed steeped in an intoxicating\n",
      "wine of expectation, while his eyes and ears and nose had never been\n",
      "keener to register the facts of the forest-land. He saw the black thing\n",
      "far ahead that resembled a burned stump, but he knew was a bear before\n",
      "it vanished; he saw gray flash of deer and wolf and coyote, and the red\n",
      "of fox, and the small, wary heads of old gobblers just sticking above\n",
      "the grass; and he saw deep tracks of game as well as the slow-rising\n",
      "blades of bluebells where some soft-footed beast had just trod. And he\n",
      "heard the melancholy notes of birds, the twitter of grouse, the sough of\n",
      "the wind, the light dropping of pine-cones, the near and distant bark of\n",
      "squirrels, the deep gobble of a turkey close at hand and the challenge\n",
      "from a rival far away, the cracking of twigs in the thickets, the murmur\n",
      "of running water, the scream of an eagle and the shrill cry of a hawk,\n",
      "and always the soft, dull, steady pads of the hoofs of the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smells, too, were the sweet, stinging ones of spring, warm and\n",
      "pleasant--the odor of the clean, fresh earth cutting its way through\n",
      "that thick, strong fragrance of pine, the smell of logs rotting in the\n",
      "sun, and of fresh new grass and flowers along a brook of snow-water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I smell smoke,” said Dale, suddenly, as he reined in, and turned for\n",
      "corroboration from his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "John sniffed the warm air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, you're more of an Injun than me,” he replied, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "They traveled on, and presently came out upon the rim of the last slope.\n",
      "A long league of green slanted below them, breaking up into straggling\n",
      "lines of trees and groves that joined the cedars, and these in turn\n",
      "stretched on and down in gray-black patches to the desert, that\n",
      "glittering and bare, with streaks of somber hue, faded in the obscurity\n",
      "of distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of Pine appeared to nestle in a curve of the edge of the\n",
      "great forest, and the cabins looked like tiny white dots set in green.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look there,” said Dale, pointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some miles to the right a gray escarpment of rock cropped out of the\n",
      "slope, forming a promontory; and from it a thin, pale column of smoke\n",
      "curled upward to be lost from sight as soon as it had no background of\n",
      "green.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's your smoke, shore enough,” replied John, thoughtfully. “Now, I\n",
      "jest wonder who's campin' there. No water near or grass for hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, that point's been used for smoke signals many a time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was jest thinkin' of thet same. Shall we ride around there an' take a\n",
      "peek?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But we'll remember that. If Beasley's got his deep scheme goin',\n",
      "he'll have Snake Anson's gang somewhere close.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy said thet same. Wal, it's some three hours till sundown. The hosses\n",
      "keep up. I reckon I'm fooled, for we'll make Pine all right. But old Tom\n",
      "there, he's tired or lazy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The big cougar was lying down, panting, and his half-shut eyes were on\n",
      "Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom's only lazy an' fat. He could travel at this gait for a week. But\n",
      "let's rest a half-hour an' watch that smoke before movin' on. We can\n",
      "make Pine before sundown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When travel had been resumed, half-way down the slope Dale's sharp eyes\n",
      "caught a broad track where shod horses had passed, climbing in a long\n",
      "slant toward the promontory. He dismounted to examine it, and John,\n",
      "coming up, proceeded with alacrity to get off and do likewise. Dale made\n",
      "his deductions, after which he stood in a brown study beside his horse,\n",
      "waiting for John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, what 'd you make of these here tracks?” asked that worthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some horses an' a pony went along here yesterday, an' to-day a single\n",
      "horse made, that fresh track.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Milt, for a hunter you ain't so bad at hoss tracks,” observed\n",
      "John, “But how many hosses went yesterday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn't make out--several--maybe four or five.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Six hosses an' a colt or little mustang, unshod, to be strict-correct.\n",
      "Wal, supposin' they did. What 's it mean to us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't know as I'd thought anythin' unusual, if it hadn't been for\n",
      "that smoke we saw off the rim, an' then this here fresh track made along\n",
      "to-day. Looks queer to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wish Roy was here,” replied John, scratching his head. “Milt, I've a\n",
      "hunch, if he was, he'd foller them tracks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe. But we haven't time for that. We can backtrail them, though, if\n",
      "they keep clear as they are here. An' we'll not lose any time, either.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That broad track led straight toward Pine, down to the edge of the\n",
      "cedars, where, amid some jagged rocks, evidences showed that men had\n",
      "camped there for days. Here it ended as a broad trail. But from the\n",
      "north came the single fresh track made that very day, and from the east,\n",
      "more in a line with Pine, came two tracks made the day before. And these\n",
      "were imprints of big and little hoofs. Manifestly these interested John\n",
      "more than they did Dale, who had to wait for his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, it ain't a colt's--thet little track,” avowed John.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not--an' what if it isn't?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, it ain't, because a colt always straggles back, an' from one\n",
      "side to t'other. This little track keeps close to the big one. An', by\n",
      "George! it was made by a led mustang.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John resembled Roy Beeman then with that leaping, intent fire in his\n",
      "gray eyes. Dale's reply was to spur his horse into a trot and call\n",
      "sharply to the lagging cougar.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they turned into the broad, blossom-bordered road that was the\n",
      "only thoroughfare of Pine the sun was setting red and gold behind the\n",
      "mountains. The horses were too tired for any more than a walk. Natives\n",
      "of the village, catching sight of Dale and Beeman, and the huge gray cat\n",
      "following like a dog, called excitedly to one another. A group of men\n",
      "in front of Turner's gazed intently down the road, and soon manifested\n",
      "signs of excitement. Dale and his comrade dismounted in front of Widow\n",
      "Cass's cottage. And Dale called as he strode up the little path. Mrs.\n",
      "Cass came out. She was white and shaking, but appeared calm. At sight of\n",
      "her John Beeman drew a sharp breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, now--” he began, hoarsely, and left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How's Roy?” queried Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord knows I'm glad to see you, boys! Milt, you're thin an'\n",
      "strange-lookin'. Roy's had a little setback. He got a shock to-day an'\n",
      "it throwed him off. Fever--an' now he's out of his head. It won't do\n",
      "no good for you to waste time seein' him. Take my word for it he's\n",
      "all right. But there's others as--For the land's sakes, Milt Dale, you\n",
      "fetched thet cougar back! Don't let him near me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom won't hurt you, mother,” said Dale, as the cougar came padding up\n",
      "the path. “You were sayin' somethin'--about others. Is Miss Helen safe?\n",
      "Hurry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ride up to see her--an' waste no more time here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale was quick in the saddle, followed by John, but the horses had to be\n",
      "severely punished to force them even to a trot. And that was a lagging\n",
      "trot, which now did not leave Torn behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ride up to Auchincloss's ranch-house seemed endless to Dale. Natives\n",
      "came out in the road to watch after he had passed. Stern as Dale was in\n",
      "dominating his feelings, he could not wholly subordinate his mounting\n",
      "joy to a waiting terrible anticipation of catastrophe. But no matter\n",
      "what awaited--nor what fateful events might hinge upon this nameless\n",
      "circumstance about to be disclosed, the wonderful and glorious fact of\n",
      "the present was that in a moment he would see Helen Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were saddled horses in the courtyard, but no riders. A Mexican\n",
      "boy sat on the porch bench, in the seat where Dale remembered he had\n",
      "encountered Al Auchincloss. The door of the big sitting-room was open.\n",
      "The scent of flowers, the murmur of bees, the pounding of hoofs came\n",
      "vaguely to Dale. His eyes dimmed, so that the ground, when he slid out\n",
      "of his saddle, seemed far below him. He stepped upon the porch. His\n",
      "sight suddenly cleared. A tight fullness at his throat made incoherent\n",
      "the words he said to the Mexican boy. But they were understood, as the\n",
      "boy ran back around the house. Dale knocked sharply and stepped over the\n",
      "threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, John, true to his habits, was thinking, even in that moment of\n",
      "suspense, about the faithful, exhausted horses. As he unsaddled them he\n",
      "talked: “Fer soft an' fat hosses, winterin' high up, wal, you've done\n",
      "somethin'!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Dale heard a voice in another room, a step, a creak of the door. It\n",
      "opened. A woman in white appeared. He recognized Helen. But instead of\n",
      "the rich brown bloom and dark-eyed beauty so hauntingly limned on\n",
      "his memory, he saw a white, beautiful face, strained and quivering in\n",
      "anguish, and eyes that pierced his heart. He could not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! my friend--you've come!” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale put out a shaking hand. But she did not see it. She clutched his\n",
      "shoulders, as if to feel whether or not he was real, and then her arms\n",
      "went up round his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, thank God! I knew you would come!” she said, and her head sank to\n",
      "his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale divined what he had suspected. Helen's sister had been carried off.\n",
      "Yet, while his quick mind grasped Helen's broken spirit--the unbalance\n",
      "that was reason for this marvelous and glorious act--he did not\n",
      "take other meaning of the embrace to himself. He just stood there,\n",
      "transported, charged like a tree struck by lightning, making sure with\n",
      "all his keen senses, so that he could feel forever, how she was clinging\n",
      "round his neck, her face over his bursting heart, her quivering form\n",
      "close pressed to his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's--Bo,” he said, unsteadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She went riding yesterday--and--never--came--back!” replied Helen,\n",
      "brokenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've seen her trail. She's been taken into the woods. I'll find her.\n",
      "I'll fetch her back,” he replied, rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a shock she seemed to absorb his meaning. With another shock she\n",
      "raised her face--leaned back a little to look at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'll find her--fetch her back?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he answered, instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that ringing word it seemed to Dale she realized how she was\n",
      "standing. He felt her shake as she dropped her arms and stepped back,\n",
      "while the white anguish of her face was flooded out by a wave of\n",
      "scarlet. But she was brave in her confusion. Her eyes never fell, though\n",
      "they changed swiftly, darkening with shame, amaze, and with feelings he\n",
      "could not read.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm almost--out of my head,” she faltered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No wonder. I saw that.... But now you must get clear-headed. I've no\n",
      "time to lose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He led her to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, it's Bo that's gone,” he called. “Since yesterday.... Send the\n",
      "boy to get me a bag of meat an' bread. You run to the corral an' get\n",
      "me a fresh horse. My old horse Ranger if you can find him quick. An'\n",
      "rustle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a word John leaped bareback on one of the horses he had just\n",
      "unsaddled and spurred him across the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the big cougar, seeing Helen, got up from where he lay on the porch\n",
      "and came to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it's Tom!” cried Helen, and as he rubbed against her knees she\n",
      "patted his head with trembling hand. “You big, beautiful pet! Oh, how I\n",
      "remember! Oh, how Bo would love to--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where's Carmichael?” interrupted Dale. “Out huntin' Bo?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. It was he who missed her first. He rode everywhere yesterday. Last\n",
      "night when he came back he was wild. I've not seen him to-day. He made\n",
      "all the other men but Hal and Joe stay home on the ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right. An' John must stay, too,” declared Dale. “But it's strange.\n",
      "Carmichael ought to have found the girl's tracks. She was ridin' a\n",
      "pony?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo rode Sam. He's a little bronc, very strong and fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come across his tracks. How'd Carmichael miss them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He didn't. He found them--trailed them all along the north range.\n",
      "That's where he forbade Bo to go. You see, they're in love with each\n",
      "other. They've been at odds. Neither will give in. Bo disobeyed him.\n",
      "There's hard ground off the north range, so he said. He was able to\n",
      "follow her tracks only so far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were there any other tracks along with hers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, I found them 'way southeast of Pine up on the slope of the\n",
      "mountain. There were seven other horses makin' that trail--when we run\n",
      "across it. On the way down we found a camp where men had waited. An'\n",
      "Bo's pony, led by a rider on a big horse, come into that camp from the\n",
      "east--maybe north a little. An' that tells the story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs ran her down--made off with her!” cried Helen, passionately. “Oh,\n",
      "the villain! He had men in waiting. That's Beasley's work. They were\n",
      "after me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may not be just what you said, but that's close enough. An' Bo's\n",
      "in a bad fix. You must face that an' try to bear up under--fears of the\n",
      "worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend! You will save her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll fetch her back, alive or dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dead! Oh, my God!” Helen cried, and closed her eyes an instant, to open\n",
      "them burning black. “But Bo isn't dead. I know that--I feel it. She'll\n",
      "not die very easy. She's a little savage. She has no fear. She'd fight\n",
      "like a tigress for her life. She's strong. You remember how strong. She\n",
      "can stand anything. Unless they murder her outright she'll live--a long\n",
      "time--through any ordeal.... So I beg you, my friend, don't lose an\n",
      "hour--don't ever give up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale trembled under the clasp of her hands. Loosing his own from her\n",
      "clinging hold, he stepped out on the porch. At that moment John appeared\n",
      "on Ranger, coming at a gallop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'll never come back without her,” said Dale. “I reckon you can\n",
      "hope--only be prepared. That's all. It's hard. But these damned deals\n",
      "are common out here in the West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose Beasley comes--here!” exclaimed Helen, and again her hand went\n",
      "out toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he does, you refuse to get off,” replied Dale. “But don't let him\n",
      "or his greasers put a dirty hand on you. Should he threaten force--why,\n",
      "pack some clothes--an' your valuables--an' go down to Mrs. Cass's. An'\n",
      "wait till I come back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait--till you--come back!” she faltered, slowly turning white again.\n",
      "Her dark eyes dilated. “Milt--you're like Las Vegas. You'll kill\n",
      "Beasley!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale heard his own laugh, very cold and strange, foreign to his ears. A\n",
      "grim, deadly hate of Beasley vied with the tenderness and pity he felt\n",
      "for this distressed girl. It was a sore trial to see her leaning there\n",
      "against the door--to be compelled to leave her alone. Abruptly be\n",
      "stalked off the porch. Tom followed him. The black horse whinnied his\n",
      "recognition of Dale and snorted at sight of the cougar. Just then the\n",
      "Mexican boy returned with a bag. Dale tied this, with the small pack,\n",
      "behind the saddle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John, you stay here with Miss Helen,” said Dale. “An' if Carmichael\n",
      "comes back, keep him, too! An' to-night, if any one rides into Pine from\n",
      "the way we come, you be sure to spot him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll do thet, Milt,” responded John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale mounted, and, turning for a last word to Helen, he felt the\n",
      "words of cheer halted on his lips as he saw her standing white and\n",
      "broken-hearted, with her hands to her bosom. He could not look twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on there, you Tom,” he called to the cougar. “Reckon on this track\n",
      "you'll pay me for all my trainin' of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my friend!” came Helen's sad voice, almost a whisper to his\n",
      "throbbing ears. “Heaven help you--to save her! I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ranger started and Dale heard no more. He could not look back. His\n",
      "eyes were full of tears and his breast ached. By a tremendous effort he\n",
      "shifted that emotion--called on all the spiritual energy of his being to\n",
      "the duty of this grim task before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not ride down through the village, but skirted the northern\n",
      "border, and worked round to the south, where, coming to the trail he had\n",
      "made an hour past, he headed on it, straight for the slope now darkening\n",
      "in the twilight. The big cougar showed more willingness to return on\n",
      "this trail than he had shown in the coming. Ranger was fresh and wanted\n",
      "to go, but Dale held him in.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cool wind blew down from the mountain with the coming of night.\n",
      "Against the brightening stars Dale saw the promontory lift its bold\n",
      "outline. It was miles away. It haunted him, strangely calling. A night,\n",
      "and perhaps a day, separated him from the gang that held Bo Rayner\n",
      "prisoner. Dale had no plan as yet. He had only a motive as great as the\n",
      "love he bore Helen Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley's evil genius had planned this abduction. Riggs was a tool, a\n",
      "cowardly knave dominated by a stronger will. Snake Anson and his gang\n",
      "had lain in wait at that cedar camp; had made that broad hoof track\n",
      "leading up the mountain. Beasley had been there with them that very day.\n",
      "All this was as assured to Dale as if he had seen the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the matter of Dale's recovering the girl and doing it speedily\n",
      "strung his mental strength to its highest pitch. Many outlines of action\n",
      "flashed through his mind as he rode on, peering keenly through the\n",
      "night, listening with practised ears. All were rejected. And at the\n",
      "outset of every new branching of thought he would gaze down at the\n",
      "gray form of the cougar, long, graceful, heavy, as he padded beside the\n",
      "horse. From the first thought of returning to help Helen Rayner he had\n",
      "conceived an undefined idea of possible value in the qualities of his\n",
      "pet. Tom had performed wonderful feats of trailing, but he had never\n",
      "been tried on men. Dale believed he could make him trail anything, yet\n",
      "he had no proof of this. One fact stood out of all Dale's conjectures,\n",
      "and it was that he had known men, and brave men, to fear cougars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far up on the slope, in a little hollow where water ran and there was\n",
      "a little grass for Ranger to pick, Dale haltered him and made ready to\n",
      "spend the night. He was sparing with his food, giving Tom more than he\n",
      "took himself. Curled close up to Dale, the big cat went to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dale lay awake for long.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was still, with only a faint moan of wind on this sheltered\n",
      "slope. Dale saw hope in the stars. He did not seem to have promised\n",
      "himself or Helen that he could save her sister, and then her property.\n",
      "He seemed to have stated something unconsciously settled, outside of his\n",
      "thinking. Strange how this certainty was not vague, yet irreconcilable\n",
      "with any plans he created! Behind it, somehow nameless with\n",
      "inconceivable power, surged all his wonderful knowledge of forest, of\n",
      "trails, of scents, of night, of the nature of men lying down to sleep in\n",
      "the dark, lonely woods, of the nature of this great cat that lived its\n",
      "every action in accordance with his will.\n",
      "\n",
      "He grew sleepy, and gradually his mind stilled, with his last conscious\n",
      "thought a portent that he would awaken to accomplish his desperate task.\n",

      "CHAPTER XX\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Burt possessed the keenest eyes of any man in Snake Anson's\n",
      "gang, for which reason he was given the post as lookout from the lofty\n",
      "promontory. His instructions were to keep sharp watch over the open\n",
      "slopes below and to report any sight of a horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cedar fire with green boughs on top of dead wood sent up a long, pale\n",
      "column of smoke. This signal-fire had been kept burning since sunrise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preceding night camp had been made on a level spot in the cedars\n",
      "back of the promontory. But manifestly Anson did not expect to remain\n",
      "there long. For, after breakfast, the packs had been made up and the\n",
      "horses stood saddled and bridled. They were restless and uneasy, tossing\n",
      "bits and fighting flies. The sun, now half-way to meridian, was hot and\n",
      "no breeze blew in that sheltered spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones had ridden off early to fill the water-bags, and had not yet\n",
      "returned. Anson, thinner and scalier and more snakelike than ever,\n",
      "was dealing a greasy, dirty deck of cards, his opponent being the\n",
      "square-shaped, black-visaged Moze. In lieu of money the gamblers wagered\n",
      "with cedar-berries, each of which berries represented a pipeful of\n",
      "tobacco. Jim Wilson brooded under a cedar-tree, his unshaven face a\n",
      "dirty dust-hue, a smoldering fire in his light eyes, a sullen set to his\n",
      "jaw. Every little while he would raise his eyes to glance at Riggs, and\n",
      "it seemed that a quick glance was enough. Riggs paced to and fro in\n",
      "the open, coatless and hatless, his black-broadcloth trousers and\n",
      "embroidered vest dusty and torn. An enormous gun bumped awkwardly in\n",
      "its sheath swinging below his hip. Riggs looked perturbed. His face was\n",
      "sweating freely, yet it was far from red in color. He did not appear to\n",
      "mind the sun or the flies. His eyes were staring, dark, wild, shifting\n",
      "in gaze from everything they encountered. But often that gaze shot back\n",
      "to the captive girl sitting under a cedar some yards from the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo Rayner's little, booted feet were tied together with one end of a\n",
      "lasso and the other end trailed off over the ground. Her hands were\n",
      "free. Her riding-habit was dusty and disordered. Her eyes blazed\n",
      "defiantly out of a small, pale face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, I wouldn't be standing in those cheap boots of yours for\n",
      "a million dollars,” she said, sarcastically. Riggs took no notice of her\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You pack that gun-sheath wrong end out. What have you got the gun for,\n",
      "anyhow?” she added, tauntingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson let out a hoarse laugh and Moze's black visage opened in a\n",
      "huge grin. Jim Wilson seemed to drink in the girl's words. Sullen and\n",
      "somber, he bent his lean head, very still, as if listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You'd better shut up,” said Riggs, darkly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not shut up,” declared Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I'll gag you,” he threatened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gag me! Why, you dirty, low-down, two-bit of a bluff!” she exclaimed,\n",
      "hotly, “I'd like to see you try it. I'll tear that long hair of yours\n",
      "right off your head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs advanced toward her with his hands clutching, as if eager to\n",
      "throttle her. The girl leaned forward, her face reddening, her eyes\n",
      "fierce.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You damned little cat!” muttered Riggs, thickly. “I'll gag you--if you\n",
      "don't stop squallin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on. I dare you to lay a hand on me.... Harve Riggs, I'm not the\n",
      "least afraid of you. Can't you savvy that? You're a liar, a four-flush,\n",
      "a sneak! Why, you're not fit to wipe the feet of any of these outlaws.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs took two long strides and bent over her, his teeth protruding in a\n",
      "snarl, and he cuffed her hard on the side of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's head jerked back with the force of the blow, but she uttered no\n",
      "cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you goin' to keep your jaw shut?” he demanded, stridently, and a\n",
      "dark tide of blood surged up into his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should smile I'm not,” retorted Bo, in cool, deliberate anger\n",
      "of opposition. “You've roped me--and you've struck me! Now get a\n",
      "club--stand off there--out of my reach--and beat me! Oh, if I only knew\n",
      "cuss words fit for you--I'd call you them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson had stopped playing cards, and was watching, listening, with\n",
      "half-disgusted, half-amused expression on his serpent-like face. Jim\n",
      "Wilson slowly rose to his feet. If any one had observed him it would\n",
      "have been to note that he now seemed singularly fascinated by this\n",
      "scene, yet all the while absorbed in himself. Once he loosened the\n",
      "neck-band of his blouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs swung his arm more violently at the girl. But she dodged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You dog!” she hissed. “Oh, if I only had a gun!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face then, with its dead whiteness and the eyes of flame, held a\n",
      "tragic, impelling beauty that stung Anson into remonstrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Riggs, don't beat up the kid,” he protested. “Thet won't do any\n",
      "good. Let her alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she's got to shut up,” replied Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How 'n hell air you goin' to shet her up? Mebbe if you get out of her\n",
      "sight she'll be quiet.... How about thet, girl?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson gnawed his drooping mustache as he eyed Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have I made any kick to you or your men yet?” she queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It strikes me you 'ain't,” replied Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't hear me make any so long as I'm treated decent,” said Bo.\n",
      "“I don't know what you've got to do with Riggs. He ran me down--roped\n",
      "me--dragged me to your camp. Now I've a hunch you're waiting for\n",
      "Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What's thet? I reckon you're Nell Rayner, who got left all old\n",
      "Auchincloss's property.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. I'm Bo Rayner. Nell is my sister. She owns the ranch. Beasley\n",
      "wanted her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson cursed deep and low. Under his sharp, bristling eyebrows he bent\n",
      "cunning green eyes upon Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, you! Is what this kid says so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. She's Nell Rayner's sister,” replied Riggs, doggedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Wal, why in the hell did you drag her into my camp an' off up\n",
      "here to signal Beasley? He ain't wantin' her. He wants the girl who owns\n",
      "the ranch. Did you take one fer the other--same as thet day we was with\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guess I must have,” replied Riggs, sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you knowed her from her sister afore you come to my camp?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs shook his head. He was paler now and sweating more freely. The\n",
      "dank hair hung wet over his forehead. His manner was that of a man\n",
      "suddenly realizing he had gotten into a tight place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he's a liar!” exclaimed Bo, with contemptuous ring in her voice.\n",
      "“He comes from my country. He has known Nell and me for years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson turned to look at Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, now hyar's a queer deal this feller has rung in on us. I thought\n",
      "thet kid was pretty young. Don't you remember Beasley told us Nell\n",
      "Rayner was a handsome woman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, pard Anson, if this heah gurl ain't handsome my eyes have gone\n",
      "pore,” drawled Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! So your Texas chilvaree over the ladies is some operatin',”\n",
      " retorted Anson, with fine sarcasm. “But thet ain't tellin' me what you\n",
      "think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I ain't tellin' you what I think yet. But I know thet kid ain't\n",
      "Nell Rayner. For I've seen her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson studied his right-hand man for a moment, then, taking out his\n",
      "tobacco-pouch, he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely\n",
      "to roll a cigarette. He put it between his thin lips and apparently\n",
      "forgot to light it. For a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and\n",
      "some scant sage-brush. Riggs took to pacing up and down. Wilson leaned\n",
      "as before against the cedar. The girl slowly recovered from her excess\n",
      "of anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kid, see hyar,” said Anson, addressing the girl; “if Riggs knowed you\n",

      "you. And I know the West well enough now to be sure that four-flush\n",
      "doesn't belong here and can't last here. He went to Dodge City once\n",
      "and when he came back he made a bluff at being a bad man. He was a\n",
      "swaggering, bragging, drinking gun-fighter. He talked of the men he'd\n",
      "shot, of the fights he'd had. He dressed like some of those gun-throwing\n",
      "gamblers.... He was in love with my sister Nell. She hated him. He\n",

      "Indian. Why, Nell and I couldn't even walk to the store in the village.\n",
      "He rode after me out on the range--chased me.... For that Carmichael\n",
      "called Riggs's bluff down in Turner's saloon. Dared him to draw! Cussed\n",
      "him every name on the range! Slapped and beat and kicked him! Drove him\n",
      "out of Pine!... And now, whatever he has said to Beasley or you, it's a\n",
      "dead sure bet he's playing his own game. That's to get hold of Nell, and\n",
      "if not her--then me!... Oh, I'm out of breath--and I'm out of names to\n",

      "\n",
      "“Wal, now--see heah, Miss. Would you bore him--if you hed a gun?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“No. I don't want his cowardly blood on my hands,” replied the girl.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Drop thet gun, you little devil!”\n",

      "“Run or dance!” cried the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big gun boomed and leaped almost out of her hand. She took both\n",
      "hands, and called derisively as she fired again. The second bullet hit\n",
      "at Riggs's feet, scattering the dust and fragments of stone all over\n",
      "him. He bounded here--there--then darted for the rocks. A third time the\n",
      "heavy gun spoke and this bullet must have ticked Riggs, for he let out a\n",
      "hoarse bawl and leaped sheer for the protection of a rock.\n",

      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson watched the whole performance with the same quietness\n",
      "that had characterized his manner toward the girl. Then, as Riggs\n",
      "disappeared, Wilson stepped forward and took the gun from the girl's\n",
      "trembling hands. She was whiter than ever, but still resolute and\n",
      "defiant. Wilson took a glance over in the direction Riggs had hidden and\n",
      "then proceeded to reload the gun. Snake Anson's roar of laughter ceased\n",
      "rather suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hyar, Jim, she might have held up the whole gang with thet gun,” he\n",

      "\n",
      "“A-huh! You know a lot about wimmen now, don't you? But thet did my\n",

      "instead of Riggs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The query seemed important and amazing. Wilson pondered.\n",

      "\n",
      "“An' let her shoot!” ejaculated Anson, nodding his long head. “Me, too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So these rough outlaws, inured to all the violence and baseness of their\n",

      "\n",
      "Just then a halloo, from the promontory brought Anson up with a start.\n",

      "“I remember once he was telling me about Snake Anson's gang. He\n",
      "mentioned you. Said you were a real gun-fighter. And what a shame it was\n",
      "you had to be an outlaw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal! An' so old Al spoke thet nice of me.... It's tolerable likely I'll\n",
      "remember. An' now, miss, can I do anythin' for you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Swift as a flash she looked at him.\n",

      "But--mebbe there's a difference in outlaws.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She understood him and paid him the compliment not to voice her sudden\n",
      "upflashing hope that he might be one to betray his leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please take this rope off my feet. Let me walk a little. Let me have\n",
      "a--a little privacy. That fool watched every move I made. I promise not\n",
      "to run away. And, oh! I'm thirsty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore you've got sense.” He freed her feet and helped her get up.\n",
      "“There'll be some fresh water any minit now, if you'll wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turned his back and walked over to where Riggs sat nursing a\n",

      "\n",
      "“Say, Riggs, I'm takin' the responsibility of loosin' the girl for a\n",
      "little spell. She can't get away. An' there ain't any sense in bein'\n",
      "mean.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs made no reply, and went on rolling down his trousers leg, lapped\n",
      "a fold over at the bottom and pulled on his boot. Then he strode out\n",
      "toward the promontory. Half-way there he encountered Anson tramping\n",
      "back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley's comin' one way an' Shady's comin' another. We'll be off this\n",

      "\n",
      "“Wal, she's walkin' 'round between heah an' Pine,” drawled Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you let her loose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I did. She's been hawg-tied all the time. An' she said she'd not\n",

      "\n",
      "“A-huh. So would I, for all of thet. But, Jim, somethin's workin' in\n",
      "you. Ain't you sort of rememberin' a time when you was young--an' mebbe\n",
      "knowed pretty kids like this one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if I am it 'll shore turn out bad fer somebody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson gave him a surprised stare and suddenly lost the bantering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! So thet's how it's workin',” he replied, and flung himself down\n",
      "in the shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Burt made his appearance then, wiping his sallow face. His\n",
      "deep-set, hungry eyes, upon which his comrades set such store, roved\n",
      "around the camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whar's the gurl?” he queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim let her go out fer a stroll,” replied Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen Jim was gittin' softy over her. Haw! Haw! Haw!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Snake Anson did not crack a smile. The atmosphere appeared not to be\n",
      "congenial for jokes, a fact Burt rather suddenly divined. Riggs and Moze\n",
      "returned from the promontory, the latter reporting that Shady Jones was\n",
      "riding up close. Then the girl walked slowly into sight and approached\n",
      "to find a seat within ten yards of the group. They waited in silence\n",
      "until the expected horseman rode up with water-bottles slung on both\n",
      "sides of his saddle. His advent was welcome. All the men were thirsty.\n",
      "Wilson took water to the girl before drinking himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's an all-fired hot ride fer water,” declared the outlaw Shady, who\n",
      "somehow fitted his name in color and impression. “An', boss, if it's the\n",
      "same to you I won't take it ag'in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cheer up, Shady. We'll be rustlin' back in the mountains before\n",
      "sundown,” said Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hang me if that ain't the cheerfulest news I've hed in some days. Hey,\n",
      "Moze?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The black-faced Moze nodded his shaggy head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm sick an' sore of this deal,” broke out Burt, evidently encouraged\n",
      "by his elders. “Ever since last fall we've been hangin' 'round--till\n",
      "jest lately freezin' in camps--no money--no drink--no grub wuth havin'.\n",
      "All on promises!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not improbably this young and reckless member of the gang had struck\n",
      "the note of discord. Wilson seemed most detached from any sentiment\n",
      "prevailing there. Some strong thoughts were revolving in his brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Burt, you ain't insinuatin' thet I made promises?” inquired Anson,\n",
      "ominously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, boss, I ain't. You allus said we might hit it rich. But them\n",
      "promises was made to you. An' it 'd be jest like thet greaser to go back\n",
      "on his word now we got the gurl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Son, it happens we got the wrong one. Our long-haired pard hyar--Mister\n",
      "Riggs--him with the big gun--he waltzes up with this sassy kid instead\n",
      "of the woman Beasley wanted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Burt snorted his disgust while Shady Jones, roundly swearing, pelted\n",
      "the smoldering camp-fire with stones. Then they all lapsed into surly\n",
      "silence. The object of their growing scorn, Riggs, sat a little\n",
      "way apart, facing none of them, but maintaining as bold a front as\n",
      "apparently he could muster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a horse shot up his ears, the first indication of scent or\n",
      "sound imperceptible to the men. But with this cue they all, except\n",
      "Wilson, sat up attentively. Soon the crack of iron-shod hoofs on stone\n",
      "broke the silence. Riggs nervously rose to his feet. And the others,\n",
      "still excepting Wilson, one by one followed suit. In another moment a\n",
      "rangy bay horse trotted out of the cedars, up to the camp, and his rider\n",
      "jumped off nimbly for so heavy a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Beasley?” was Anson's greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Snake, old man!” replied Beasley, as his bold, snapping black\n",
      "eyes swept the group. He was dusty and hot, and wet with sweat, yet\n",
      "evidently too excited to feel discomfort. “I seen your smoke signal\n",
      "first off an' jumped my hoss quick. But I rode north of Pine before I\n",
      "headed 'round this way. Did you corral the girl or did Riggs? Say!--you\n",
      "look queer!... What's wrong here? You haven't signaled me for nothin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson beckoned to Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come out of the shade. Let him look you over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl walked out from under the spreading cedar that had hidden her\n",
      "from sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley stared aghast--his jaw dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's the kid sister of the woman I wanted!” he ejaculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So we've jest been told.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Astonishment still held Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Told?” he echoed. Suddenly his big body leaped with a start. “Who got\n",
      "her? Who fetched her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Mister Gunman Riggs hyar,” replied Anson, with a subtle scorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs, you got the wrong girl,” shouted Beasley. “You made thet mistake\n",
      "once before. What're you up to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I chased her an' when I got her, seein' it wasn't Nell Rayner--why--I\n",
      "kept her, anyhow,” replied Riggs. “An' I've got a word for your ear\n",
      "alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man, you're crazy--queerin' my deal thet way!” roared Beasley. “You\n",
      "heard my plans.... Riggs, this girl-stealin' can't be done twice. Was\n",
      "you drinkin' or locoed or what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley, he was giving you the double-cross,” cut in Bo Rayner's cool\n",
      "voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rancher stared speechlessly at her, then at Anson, then at Wilson,\n",
      "and last at Riggs, when his brown visage shaded dark with rush of purple\n",
      "blood. With one lunge he knocked Riggs flat, then stood over him with a\n",
      "convulsive hand at his gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You white-livered card-sharp! I've a notion to bore you.... They told\n",
      "me you had a deal of your own, an' now I believe it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--I had,” replied Riggs, cautiously getting up. He was ghastly. “But\n",
      "I wasn't double-crossin' you. Your deal was to get the girl away from\n",
      "home so you could take possession of her property. An' I wanted her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for did you fetch the sister, then?” demanded Beasley, his big jaw\n",
      "bulging.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I've a plan to--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plan hell! You've spoiled my plan an' I've seen about enough of you.”\n",
      " Beasley breathed hard; his lowering gaze boded an uncertain will toward\n",
      "the man who had crossed him; his hand still hung low and clutching.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley, tell them to get my horse. I want to go home,” said Bo Rayner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly Beasley turned. Her words enjoined a silence. What to do with her\n",
      "now appeared a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had nothin' to do with fetchin' you here an' I'll have nothin' to do\n",
      "with sendin' you back or whatever's done with you,” declared Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the girl's face flashed white again and her eyes changed to fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're as big a liar as Riggs,” she cried, passionately. “And you're\n",
      "a thief, a bully who picks on defenseless girls. Oh, we know your game!\n",
      "Milt Dale heard your plot with this outlaw Anson to steal my sister. You\n",
      "ought to be hanged--you half-breed greaser!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll cut out your tongue!” hissed Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I'll bet you would if you had me alone. But these outlaws--these\n",
      "sheep-thieves--these tools you hire are better than you and Riggs....\n",
      "What do you suppose Carmichael will do to you? Carmichael! He's my\n",
      "sweetheart--that cowboy. You know what he did to Riggs. Have you brains\n",
      "enough to know what he'll do to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He'll not do much,” growled Beasley. But the thick purplish blood was\n",
      "receding from his face. “Your cowpuncher--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah!” she interrupted, and she snapped her fingers in his face. “He's\n",
      "from Texas! He's from TEXAS!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Supposin' he is from Texas?” demanded Beasley, in angry irritation.\n",
      "“What's thet? Texans are all over. There's Jim Wilson, Snake Anson's\n",
      "right-hand man. He's from Texas. But thet ain't scarin' any one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He pointed toward Wilson, who shifted uneasily from foot to foot. The\n",
      "girl's flaming glance followed his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you from Texas?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss, I am--an' I reckon I don't deserve it,” replied Wilson. It\n",
      "was certain that a vague shame attended his confession.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I believed even a bandit from Texas would fight for a helpless\n",
      "girl!” she replied, in withering scorn of disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson dropped his head. If any one there suspected a serious\n",
      "turn to Wilson's attitude toward that situation it was the keen outlaw\n",
      "leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley, you're courtin' death,” he broke in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You bet you are!” added Bo, with a passion that made her listeners\n",
      "quiver. “You've put me at the mercy of a gang of outlaws! You may force\n",
      "my sister out of her home! But your day will come.' Tom Carmichael will\n",
      "KILL you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley mounted his horse. Sullen, livid, furious, he sat shaking in the\n",
      "saddle, to glare down at the outlaw leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, thet's no fault of mine the deal's miscarried. I was square. I\n",
      "made my offer for the workin' out of my plan. It 'ain't been done. Now\n",
      "there's hell to pay an' I'm through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beasley, I reckon I couldn't hold you to anythin',” replied Anson,\n",
      "slowly. “But if you was square you ain't square now. We've hung around\n",
      "an' tried hard. My men are all sore. An' we're broke, with no outfit to\n",
      "speak of. Me an' you never fell out before. But I reckon we might.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Like hell we would!” he said.\n",

      "“Break camp,” he ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs had probably not heard that last exchange between Anson and\n",

      "\n",
      "In a few moments when they started off, Burt, Jones, and Moze were in\n",

      "rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "This start was made a little after the noon hour. They zigzagged up the\n",
      "slope, took to a deep ravine, and followed it up to where it headed in\n",
      "the level forest. From there travel was rapid, the pack-horses being\n",
      "driven at a jogtrot. Once when a troop of deer burst out of a thicket\n",
      "into a glade, to stand with ears high, young Burt halted the cavalcade.\n",
      "His well-aimed shot brought down a deer. Then the men rode on, leaving\n",
      "him behind to dress and pack the meat. The only other halt made was at\n",
      "the crossing of the first water, a clear, swift brook, where both horses\n",
      "and men drank thirstily. Here Burt caught up with his comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "They traversed glade and park, and wended a crooked trail through the\n",
      "deepening forest, and climbed, bench after bench, to higher ground,\n",
      "while the sun sloped to the westward, lower and redder. Sunset had gone,\n",
      "and twilight was momentarily brightening to the afterglow when Anson,\n",
      "breaking his silence of the afternoon, ordered a halt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place was wild, dismal, a shallow vale between dark slopes of\n",
      "spruce. Grass, fire-wood, and water were there in abundance. All the\n",
      "men were off, throwing saddles and packs, before the tired girl made an\n",
      "effort to get down. Riggs, observing her, made a not ungentle move to\n",
      "pull her off. She gave him a sounding slap with her gloved hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your paws to yourself,” she said. No evidence of exhaustion was\n",
      "there in her spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson had observed this by-play, but Anson had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What come off?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, the Honorable Gunman Riggs jest got caressed by the lady--as he\n",
      "was doin' the elegant,” replied Moze, who stood nearest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, was you watchin'?” queried Anson. His curiosity had held through\n",
      "the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He tried to yank her off an' she biffed him,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",

      "Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, you mean plain cussed. Mark my words, he'll hoodoo this outfit.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many hands made quick work. In a few moments a fire was burning\n",
      "brightly, water was boiling, pots were steaming, the odor of venison\n",
      "permeated the cool air. The girl had at last slipped off her saddle to\n",
      "the ground, where she sat while Riggs led the horse away. She sat there\n",
      "apparently forgotten, a pathetic droop to her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson had taken an ax and was vigorously wielding it among the spruces.\n",
      "One by one they fell with swish and soft crash. Then the sliding ring\n",
      "of the ax told how he was slicing off the branches with long sweeps.\n",
      "Presently he appeared in the semi-darkness, dragging half-trimmed\n",
      "spruces behind him. He made several trips, the last of which was to\n",
      "stagger under a huge burden of spruce boughs. These he spread under a\n",
      "low, projecting branch of an aspen. Then he leaned the bushy spruces\n",
      "slantingly against this branch on both sides, quickly improvising a\n",
      "V-shaped shelter with narrow aperture in front. Next from one of\n",
      "the packs he took a blanket and threw that inside the shelter. Then,\n",
      "touching the girl on the shoulder, he whispered:\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you're ready, slip in there. An' don't lose no sleep by worryin',\n",
      "fer I'll be layin' right here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made a motion to indicate his length across the front of the narrow\n",
      "aperture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, thank you! Maybe you really are a Texan,” she whispered back.\n",

      "\n",
      "Whatever loquacity and companionship had previously existed in\n",
      "Snake Anson's gang were not manifest in this camp. Each man seemed\n",
      "preoccupied, as if pondering the dawn in his mind of an ill omen not\n",
      "clear to him yet and not yet dreamed of by his fellows. They all smoked.\n",
      "Then Moze and Shady played cards awhile by the light of the fire, but it\n",
      "was a dull game, in which either seldom spoke. Riggs sought his blanket\n",
      "first, and the fact was significant that he lay down some distance from\n",
      "the spruce shelter which contained Bo Rayner. Presently young Burt went\n",
      "off grumbling to his bed. And not long afterward the card-players did\n",
      "likewise.\n",

      "The night was dark, with only a few stars showing. A fitful wind moaned\n",
      "unearthly through the spruce. An occasional thump of hoof sounded from\n",

      "wildness of forest-land.\n",

      "Anson. Then he threw up his hands in a strange gesture of resignation.\n",
      "The outlaw was brave, but all men of the wilds recognized a force\n",
      "stronger than themselves. He sat there resembling a brooding snake with\n",
      "basilisk eyes upon the fire. At length he arose, and without another\n",
      "word to his comrade he walked wearily to where lay the dark, quiet forms\n",
      "of the sleepers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim Wilson remained beside the flickering fire. He was reading something\n",
      "in the red embers, perhaps the past. Shadows were on his face, not all\n",
      "from the fading flames or the towering spruces. Ever and anon he raised\n",
      "his head to listen, not apparently that he expected any unusual sound,\n",
      "but as if involuntarily. Indeed, as Anson had said, there was something\n",
      "nameless in the air. The black forest breathed heavily, in fitful moans\n",
      "of wind. It had its secrets. The glances Wilson threw on all sides\n",
      "betrayed that any hunted man did not love the dark night, though it hid\n",
      "him. Wilson seemed fascinated by the life inclosed there by the black\n",
      "circle of spruce. He might have been reflecting on the strange reaction\n",
      "happening to every man in that group, since a girl had been brought\n",
      "among them. Nothing was clear, however; the forest kept its secret, as\n",
      "did the melancholy wind; the outlaws were sleeping like tired beasts,\n",
      "with their dark secrets locked in their hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Wilson put some sticks on the red embers, then pulled the\n",
      "end of a log over them. A blaze sputtered up, changing the dark circle\n",
      "and showing the sleepers with their set, shadowed faces upturned. Wilson\n",
      "gazed on all of them, a sardonic smile on his lips, and then his look\n",
      "fixed upon the sleeper apart from the others--Riggs. It might have been\n",
      "the false light of flame and shadow that created Wilson's expression of\n",
      "dark and terrible hate. Or it might have been the truth, expressed\n",
      "in that lonely, unguarded hour, from the depths of a man born in the\n",
      "South--a man who by his inheritance of race had reverence for all\n",
      "womanhood--by whose strange, wild, outlawed bloody life of a gun-fighter\n",
      "he must hate with the deadliest hate this type that aped and mocked his\n",
      "fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long gaze Wilson rested upon Riggs--as strange and secretive as\n",
      "the forest wind moaning down the great aisles--and when that dark gaze\n",
      "was withdrawn Wilson stalked away to make his bed with the stride of one\n",
      "ill whom spirit had liberated force.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid his saddle in front of the spruce shelter where the girl had\n",
      "entered, and his tarpaulin and blankets likewise and then wearily\n",
      "stretched his long length to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camp-fire blazed up, showing the exquisite green and brown-flecked\n",
      "festooning of the spruce branches, symmetrical and perfect, yet so\n",
      "irregular, and then it burned out and died down, leaving all in the dim\n",
      "gray starlight. The horses were not moving around; the moan of night\n",
      "wind had grown fainter; the low hum of insects was dying away; even\n",
      "the tinkle of the brook had diminished. And that growth toward absolute\n",
      "silence continued, yet absolute silence was never attained. Life abided\n",
      "in the forest; only it had changed its form for the dark hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's gang did not bestir themselves at the usual early sunrise hour\n",
      "common to all woodsmen, hunters, or outlaws, to whom the break of day\n",
      "was welcome. These companions--Anson and Riggs included--might have\n",
      "hated to see the dawn come. It meant only another meager meal, then\n",
      "the weary packing and the long, long ride to nowhere in particular,\n",
      "and another meager meal--all toiled for without even the necessities of\n",
      "satisfactory living, and assuredly without the thrilling hopes that\n",
      "made their life significant, and certainly with a growing sense of\n",
      "approaching calamity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlaw leader rose surly and cross-grained. He had to boot Burt\n",
      "to drive him out for the horses. Riggs followed him. Shady Jones did\n",
      "nothing except grumble. Wilson, by common consent, always made the\n",
      "sour-dough bread, and he was slow about it this morning. Anson and Moze\n",
      "did the rest of the work, without alacrity. The girl did not appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she dead?” growled Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, she ain't,” replied Wilson, looking up. “She's sleepin'. Let her\n",
      "sleep. She'd shore be a sight better off if she was daid.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! So would all of this hyar outfit,” was Anson's response.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Sna-ake, I shore reckon we'll all be thet there soon,” drawled\n",
      "Wilson, in his familiar cool and irritating tone that said so much more\n",
      "than the content of the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson did not address the Texas member of his party again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burt rode bareback into camp, driving half the number of the horses;\n",
      "Riggs followed shortly with several more. But three were missed, one\n",
      "of them being Anson's favorite. He would not have budged without that\n",
      "horse. During breakfast he growled about his lazy men, and after the\n",
      "meal tried to urge them off. Riggs went unwillingly. Burt refused to go\n",
      "at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nix. I footed them hills all I'm a-goin' to,” he said. “An' from now on\n",
      "I rustle my own hoss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The leader glared his reception of this opposition. Perhaps his sense of\n",
      "fairness actuated him once more, for he ordered Shady and Moze out to do\n",
      "their share.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you're the best tracker in this outfit. Suppose you go,” suggested\n",
      "Anson. “You allus used to be the first one off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Times has changed, Snake,” was the imperturbable reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, won't you go?” demanded the leader, impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shore won't.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson did not look or intimate in any way that he would not leave the\n",
      "girl in camp with one or any or all of Anson's gang, but the truth was\n",
      "as significant as if he had shouted it. The slow-thinking Moze gave\n",
      "Wilson a sinister look.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, ain't it funny how a pretty wench--?” began Shady Jones,\n",
      "sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shut up, you fool!” broke in Anson. “Come on, I'll help rustle them\n",
      "hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had gone Burt took his rifle and strolled off into the\n",
      "forest. Then the girl appeared. Her hair was down, her face pale, with\n",
      "dark shadows. She asked for water to wash her face. Wilson pointed to\n",
      "the brook, and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean\n",
      "scarf from his pack and carried them to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon her return to the camp-fire she looked very different with her hair\n",
      "arranged and the red stains in her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, air you hungry?” asked Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He helped her to portions of bread, venison and gravy, and a cup of\n",
      "coffee. Evidently she relished the meat, but she had to force down the\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are they all?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rustlin' the hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably she divined that he did not want to talk, for the fleeting\n",
      "glance she gave him attested to a thought that his voice or demeanor had\n",
      "changed. Presently she sought a seat under the aspen-tree, out of\n",
      "the sun, and the smoke continually blowing in her face; and there she\n",
      "stayed, a forlorn little figure, for all the resolute lips and defiant\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Texan paced to and fro beside the camp-fire with bent head,\n",
      "and hands locked behind him. But for the swinging gun he would have\n",
      "resembled a lanky farmer, coatless and hatless, with his brown vest\n",
      "open, his trousers stuck in the top of the high boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "And neither he nor the girl changed their positions relatively for\n",
      "a long time. At length, however, after peering into the woods, and\n",
      "listening, he remarked to the girl that he would be back in a moment,\n",
      "and then walked off around the spruces.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had he disappeared--in fact, so quickly after-ward that it\n",
      "presupposed design instead of accident--than Riggs came running from the\n",
      "opposite side of the glade. He ran straight to the girl, who sprang to\n",
      "her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hid--two of the--horses,” he panted, husky with excitement. “I'll\n",
      "take--two saddles. You grab some grub. We'll run for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she cried, stepping back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it's not safe--for us--here,” he said, hurriedly, glancing all\n",
      "around. “I'll take you--home. I swear.... Not safe--I tell you--this\n",
      "gang's after me. Hurry!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid hold of two saddles, one with each hand. The moment had reddened\n",
      "his face, brightened his eyes, made his action strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm safer--here with this outlaw gang,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won't come!” His color began to lighten then, and his face to\n",
      "distort. He dropped his hold on the saddles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, I'd rather become a toy and a rag for these ruffians than\n",
      "spend an hour alone with you,” she flashed at him, in unquenchable hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll drag you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized her, but could not hold her. Breaking away, she screamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Help!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That whitened his face, drove him to frenzy. Leaping forward, he struck\n",
      "her a hard blow across the mouth. It staggered her, and, tripping on a\n",
      "saddle, she fell. His hands flew to her throat, ready to choke her. But\n",
      "she lay still and held her tongue. Then he dragged her to her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hurry now--grab that pack--an' follow me.” Again Riggs laid hold of the\n",
      "two saddles. A desperate gleam, baleful and vainglorious, flashed over\n",
      "his face. He was living his one great adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl's eyes dilated. They looked beyond him. Her lips opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Scream again an' I'll kill you!” he cried, hoarsely and swiftly. The\n",
      "very opening of her lips had terrified Riggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon one scream was enough,” spoke a voice, slow, but without the\n",
      "drawl, easy and cool, yet incalculable in some terrible sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs wheeled with inarticulate cry. Wilson stood a few paces off, with\n",
      "his gun half leveled, low down. His face seemed as usual, only his eyes\n",
      "held a quivering, light intensity, like boiling molten silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Girl, what made thet blood on your mouth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Riggs hit me!” she whispered. Then at something she feared or saw or\n",
      "divined she shrank back, dropped on her knees, and crawled into the\n",
      "spruce shelter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Riggs, I'd invite you to draw if thet 'd be any use,” said Wilson.\n",
      "This speech was reflective, yet it hurried a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riggs could not draw nor move nor speak. He seemed turned to stone,\n",
      "except his jaw, which slowly fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Harve Riggs, gunman from down Missouri way,” continued the voice of\n",
      "incalculable intent, “reckon you've looked into a heap of gun-barrels in\n",
      "your day. Shore! Wal, look in this heah one!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson deliberately leveled the gun on a line with Riggs's starting\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't you heard to brag in Turner's saloon--thet you could see lead\n",
      "comin'--an' dodge it? Shore you must be swift!... DODGE THIS HEAH\n",
      "BULLET!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gun spouted flame and boomed. One of Riggs's starting, popping\n",
      "eyes--the right one--went out, like a lamp. The other rolled horribly,\n",
      "then set in blank dead fixedness. Riggs swayed in slow motion until a\n",
      "lost balance felled him heavily, an inert mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson bent over the prostrate form. Strange, violent contrast to the\n",
      "cool scorn of the preceding moment! Hissing, spitting, as if poisoned by\n",
      "passion, he burst with the hate that his character had forbidden him to\n",
      "express on a living counterfeit. Wilson was shaken, as if by a palsy. He\n",
      "choked over passionate, incoherent invective. It was class hate first,\n",
      "then the hate of real manhood for a craven, then the hate of disgrace\n",
      "for a murder. No man so fair as a gun-fighter in the Western creed of an\n",
      "“even break”!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's terrible cataclysm of passion passed. Straightening up, he\n",
      "sheathed his weapon and began a slow pace before the fire. Not many\n",
      "moments afterward he jerked his head high and listened. Horses were\n",
      "softly thudding through the forest. Soon Anson rode into sight with\n",
      "his men and one of the strayed horses. It chanced, too, that young Burt\n",
      "appeared on the other side of the glade. He walked quickly, as one who\n",
      "anticipated news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Snake Anson as he dismounted espied the dead man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--I thought I heard a shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The others exclaimed and leaped off their horses to view the prostrate\n",
      "form with that curiosity and strange fear common to all men confronted\n",
      "by sight of sudden death.\n",
      "\n",
      "That emotion was only momentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shot his lamp out!” ejaculated Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wonder how Gunman Riggs liked thet plumb center peg!” exclaimed Shady\n",
      "Jones, with a hard laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Back of his head all gone!” gasped young Burt. Not improbably he had\n",
      "not seen a great many bullet-marked men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim!--the long-haired fool didn't try to draw on you!” exclaimed Snake\n",
      "Anson, astounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson neither spoke nor ceased his pacing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was it over?” added Anson, curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He hit the gurl,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there were long-drawn exclamations all around, and glance met\n",
      "glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you saved me the job,” continued the outlaw leader. “An' I'm much\n",
      "obliged.... Fellars, search Riggs an' we'll divvy.... Thet all right,\n",
      "Jim?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, an' you can have my share.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They found bank-notes in the man's pocket and considerable gold worn in\n",
      "a money-belt around his waist. Shady Jones appropriated his boots, and\n",
      "Moze his gun. Then they left him as he had fallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, you'll have to track them lost hosses. Two still missin' an' one\n",
      "of them's mine,” called Anson as Wilson paced to the end of his beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl heard Anson, for she put her head out of the spruce shelter and\n",
      "called: “Riggs said he'd hid two of the horses. They must be close. He\n",
      "came that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, kid! Thet's good news,” replied Anson. His spirits were rising.\n",
      "“He must hev wanted you to slope with him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I wouldn't go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' then he hit you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, recallin' your talk of yestiddy, I can't see as Mister Riggs\n",
      "lasted much longer hyar than he'd hev lasted in Texas. We've some of\n",
      "thet great country right in our outfit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl withdrew her white face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's break camp, boys,” was the leader's order. “A couple of you look\n",
      "up them hosses. They'll be hid in some thick spruces. The rest of us 'll\n",
      "pack.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon the gang was on the move, heading toward the height of land, and\n",
      "swerving from it only to find soft and grassy ground that would not\n",
      "leave any tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did not travel more than a dozen miles during the afternoon, but\n",
      "they climbed bench after bench until they reached the timbered plateau\n",
      "that stretched in sheer black slope up to the peaks. Here rose the great\n",
      "and gloomy forest of firs and pines, with the spruce overshadowed and\n",
      "thinned out. The last hour of travel was tedious and toilsome, a zigzag,\n",
      "winding, breaking, climbing hunt for the kind of camp-site suited\n",
      "to Anson's fancy. He seemed to be growing strangely irrational about\n",
      "selecting places to camp. At last, for no reason that could have been\n",
      "manifest to a good woodsman, he chose a gloomy bowl in the center of the\n",
      "densest forest that had been traversed. The opening, if such it could\n",
      "have been called, was not a park or even a glade. A dark cliff, with\n",
      "strange holes, rose to one side, but not so high as the lofty pines that\n",
      "brushed it. Along its base babbled a brook, running over such formation\n",
      "of rock that from different points near at hand it gave forth different\n",
      "sounds, some singing, others melodious, and one at least of a hollow,\n",
      "weird, deep sound, not loud, but strangely penetrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure spooky I say,” observed Shady, sentiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little uplift of mood, coincident with the rifling of Riggs's\n",
      "person, had not worn over to this evening camp. What talk the outlaws\n",
      "indulged in was necessary and conducted in low tones. The place enjoined\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson performed for the girl very much the same service as he had the\n",
      "night before. Only he advised her not to starve herself; she must eat\n",
      "to keep up her strength. She complied at the expense of considerable\n",
      "effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it had been a back-breaking day, in which all of them, except the\n",
      "girl, had climbed miles on foot, they did not linger awake long enough\n",
      "after supper to learn what a wild, weird, and pitch-black spot the\n",
      "outlaw leader had chosen. The little spaces of open ground between the\n",
      "huge-trunked pine-trees had no counterpart up in the lofty spreading\n",
      "foliage. Not a star could blink a wan ray of light into that Stygian\n",
      "pit. The wind, cutting down over abrupt heights farther up, sang in the\n",
      "pine-needles as if they were strings vibrant with chords. Dismal creaks\n",
      "were audible. They were the forest sounds of branch or tree rubbing one\n",
      "another, but which needed the corrective medium of daylight to convince\n",
      "any human that they were other than ghostly. Then, despite the wind and\n",
      "despite the changing murmur of the brook, there seemed to be a silence\n",
      "insulating them, as deep and impenetrable as the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the outlaws, who were fugitives now, slept the sleep of the weary,\n",
      "and heard nothing. They awoke with the sun, when the forest seemed smoky\n",
      "in a golden gloom, when light and bird and squirrel proclaimed the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses had not strayed out of this basin during the night, a\n",
      "circumstance that Anson was not slow to appreciate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ain't no cheerful camp, but I never seen a safer place to hole up\n",
      "in,” he remarked to Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, yes--if any place is safe,” replied that ally, dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can watch our back tracks. There ain't any other way to git in hyar\n",
      "thet I see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, we was tolerable fair sheep-rustlers, but we're no good\n",
      "woodsmen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson grumbled his disdain of this comrade who had once been his\n",
      "mainstay. Then he sent Burt out to hunt fresh meat and engaged his other\n",
      "men at cards. As they now had the means to gamble, they at once became\n",
      "absorbed. Wilson smoked and divided his thoughtful gaze between the\n",
      "gamblers and the drooping figure of the girl. The morning air was\n",
      "keen, and she, evidently not caring to be near her captors beside the\n",
      "camp-fire, had sought the only sunny spot in this gloomy dell. A couple\n",
      "of hours passed; the sun climbed high; the air grew warmer. Once the\n",
      "outlaw leader raised his head to scan the heavy-timbered slopes that\n",
      "inclosed the camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, them hosses are strayin' off,” he observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson leisurely rose and stalked off across the small, open patches,\n",
      "in the direction of the horses. They had grazed around from the right\n",
      "toward the outlet of the brook. Here headed a ravine, dense and green.\n",
      "Two of the horses had gone down. Wilson evidently heard them, though\n",
      "they were not in sight, and he circled somewhat so as to get ahead of\n",
      "them and drive them back. The invisible brook ran down over the rocks\n",
      "with murmur and babble. He halted with instinctive action. He listened.\n",
      "Forest sounds, soft, lulling, came on the warm, pine-scented breeze. It\n",
      "would have taken no keen ear to hear soft and rapid padded footfalls.\n",
      "He moved on cautiously and turned into a little open, mossy spot,\n",
      "brown-matted and odorous, full of ferns and bluebells. In the middle\n",
      "of this, deep in the moss, he espied a huge round track of a cougar.\n",
      "He bent over it. Suddenly he stiffened, then straightened guardedly. At\n",
      "that instant he received a hard prod in the back. Throwing up his hands,\n",
      "he stood still, then slowly turned. A tall hunter in gray buckskin,\n",
      "gray-eyed and square-jawed, had him covered with a cocked rifle. And\n",
      "beside this hunter stood a monster cougar, snarling and blinking.\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER XXII\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Dale,” drawled Wilson. “Reckon you're a little previous on me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sssssh! Not so loud,” said the hunter, in low voice. “You're Jim\n",
      "Wilson?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore am. Say, Dale, you showed up soon. Or did you jest happen to run\n",

      "\n",
      "“I knowed thet when I seen you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cougar seemed actuated by the threatening position of his master,\n",
      "and he opened his mouth, showing great yellow fangs, and spat at Wilson.\n",
      "The outlaw apparently had no fear of Dale or the cocked rifle, but that\n",
      "huge, snarling cat occasioned him uneasiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson, I've heard you spoken of as a white outlaw,” said Dale.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Wal, lemme see. Supposin' I refuse?” queried Wilson, shrewdly.\n",

      "“Reckon I 'ain't got much choice. Yes, I'll do it. But, Dale, are you\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am. You're no fool. An' I believe you're square. I've got Anson\n",
      "and his gang corralled. You can't slip me--not in these woods. I could\n",
      "run off your horses--pick you off one by one--or turn the cougar loose\n",
      "on you at night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. It's your game. Anson dealt himself this hand.... Between you\n",
      "an' me, Dale, I never liked the deal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who shot Riggs?... I found his body.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“She's shore jest as safe an' sound as when she was home. Dale, she's\n",
      "the gamest kid thet ever breathed! Why, no one could hev ever made me\n",
      "believe a girl, a kid like her, could hev the nerve she's got. Nothin's\n",

      "“It must be done quick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Dale, listen,” remonstrated Wilson, earnestly. “Too quick 'll\n",

      "been hurt by a person an' he's never fought anythin' himself but deer\n",
      "an' bear. I can make him trail any scent. But the truth is I couldn't\n",
      "make him hurt you or anybody. All the same, he can be made to scare the\n",
      "hair off any one who doesn't know him.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I jest met Dale down in the woods with his pet cougar. He's after you.\n",
      "I'm goin' to help him git you safe away. Now you do your part. I want\n",

      "\n",
      "Before he began to speak she was pale, sad, dull of eye. Swiftly, with\n",
      "his words, she was transformed, and when he had ended she did not appear\n",
      "the same girl. She gave him one blazing flash of comprehension and\n",
      "nodded her head rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I understand. I'll do it!” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlaw turned slowly away with the most abstract air, confounded\n",
      "amid his shrewd acting, and he did not collect himself until half-way\n",
      "back to his comrades. Then, beginning to hum an old darky tune, he\n",
      "stirred up and replenished the fire, and set about preparation for the\n",
      "midday meal. But he did not miss anything going on around him. He saw\n",
      "the girl go into her shelter and come out with her hair all down over\n",
      "her face. Wilson, back to his comrades, grinned his glee, and he wagged\n",
      "his head as if he thought the situation was developing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gambling outlaws, however, did not at once see the girl preening\n",
      "herself and smoothing her long hair in a way calculated to startle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Busted!” ejaculated Anson, with a curse, as he slammed down his cards.\n",
      "“If I ain't hoodooed I'm a two-bit of a gambler!”\n",

      "luck--nothin' but the wust end of everythin'. I ain't blamin' anybody.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Snake, shore it was the gurl deal you made,” rejoined Wilson, who had\n",

      "wind-up. Look!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson pointed to where the girl stood, her hair flying wildly all over\n",

      "\n",
      "Anson started. He grew utterly astounded. His amaze was ludicrous. And\n",
      "the other two men looked to stare, to equal their leader's bewilderment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What 'n hell's come over her?” asked Anson, dubiously. “Must hev perked\n",
      "up.... But she ain't feelin' thet gay!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson tapped his forehead with a significant finger.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“If she hain't queer I never seen no queer wimmin,” vouchsafed Shady\n",

      "\n",
      "Moze looked beyond words, and quite alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seen it comin',” declared Wilson, very much excited. “But I was\n",
      "scared to say so. You-all made fun of me aboot her. Now I shore wish I\n",
      "had spoken up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson nodded solemnly. He did not believe the evidence of his sight,\n",
      "but the facts seemed stunning. As if the girl were a dangerous and\n",
      "incomprehensible thing, he approached her step by step. Wilson followed,\n",
      "and the others appeared drawn irresistibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey thar--kid!” called Anson, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl drew her slight form up haughtily. Through her spreading\n",
      "tresses her eyes gleamed unnaturally upon the outlaw leader. But she\n",
      "deigned not to reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey thar--you Rayner girl!” added Anson, lamely. “What's ailin' you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My lord! did you address me?” she asked, loftily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones got over his consternation and evidently extracted some\n",
      "humor from the situation, as his dark face began to break its strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aww!” breathed Anson, heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ophelia awaits your command, my lord. I've been gathering flowers,”\n",
      " she said, sweetly, holding up her empty hands as if they contained a\n",
      "bouquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones exploded in convulsed laughter. But his merriment was not\n",
      "shared. And suddenly it brought disaster upon him. The girl flew at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you croak, you toad? I will have you whipped and put in irons,\n",
      "you scullion!” she cried, passionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady underwent a remarkable change, and stumbled in his backward\n",
      "retreat. Then she snapped her fingers in Moze's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You black devil! Get hence! Avaunt!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson plucked up courage enough to touch her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aww! Now, Ophelyar--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably he meant to try to humor her, but she screamed, and he jumped\n",
      "back as if she might burn him. She screamed shrilly, in wild, staccato\n",
      "notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You! You!” she pointed her finger at the outlaw leader. “You brute to\n",
      "women! You ran off from your wife!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson turned plum-color and then slowly white. The girl must have sent a\n",
      "random shot home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now the devil's turned you into a snake. A long, scaly snake with\n",
      "green eyes! Uugh! You'll crawl on your belly soon--when my cowboy finds\n",
      "you. And he'll tramp you in the dust.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She floated away from them and began to whirl gracefully, arms spread\n",
      "and hair flying; and then, apparently oblivious of the staring men, she\n",
      "broke into a low, sweet song. Next she danced around a pine, then danced\n",
      "into her little green inclosure. From which presently she sent out the\n",
      "most doleful moans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aww! What a shame!” burst out Anson. “Thet fine, healthy, nervy kid!\n",
      "Clean gone! Daffy! Crazy 'n a bedbug!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's a shame,” protested Wilson. “But it's wuss for us. Lord! if\n",
      "we was hoodooed before, what will we be now? Didn't I tell you, Snake\n",
      "Anson? You was warned. Ask Shady an' Moze--they see what's up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No luck 'll ever come our way ag'in,” predicted Shady, mournfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It beats me, boss, it beats me,” muttered Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A crazy woman on my hands! If thet ain't the last straw!” broke out\n",
      "Anson, tragically, as he turned away. Ignorant, superstitious, worked\n",
      "upon by things as they seemed, the outlaw imagined himself at last beset\n",
      "by malign forces. When he flung himself down upon one of the packs his\n",
      "big red-haired hands shook. Shady and Moze resembled two other men at\n",
      "the end of their ropes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's tense face twitched, and he averted it, as apparently he fought\n",
      "off a paroxysm of some nature. Just then Anson swore a thundering oath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crazy or not, I'll git gold out of thet kid!” he roared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, man, talk sense. Are you gittin' daffy, too? I declare this\n",
      "outfit's been eatin' loco. You can't git gold fer her!” said Wilson,\n",
      "deliberately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why can't I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Cause we're tracked. We can't make no dickers. Why, in another day or\n",
      "so we'll be dodgin' lead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tracked! Whar 'd you git thet idee? As soon as this?” queried Anson,\n",
      "lifting his head like a striking snake. His men, likewise, betrayed\n",
      "sudden interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's no idee. I 'ain't seen any one. But I feel it in my senses.\n",
      "I hear somebody comin'--a step on our trail--all the time--night in\n",
      "particular. Reckon there's a big posse after us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if I see or hear anythin' I'll knock the girl on the head an'\n",
      "we'll dig out of hyar,” replied Anson, sullenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson executed a swift forward motion, violent and passionate, so\n",
      "utterly unlike what might have been looked for from him, that the three\n",
      "outlaws gaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you'll shore hev to knock Jim Wilson on the haid first,” he said,\n",
      "in voice as strange as his action.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim! You wouldn't go back on me!” implored Anson, with uplifted hands,\n",
      "in a dignity of pathos.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm losin' my haid, too, an' you shore might as well knock it in, an'\n",
      "you'll hev to before I'll stand you murderin' thet pore little gurl\n",
      "you've drove crazy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, I was only mad,” replied Anson. “Fer thet matter, I'm growin'\n",
      "daffy myself. Aw! we all need a good stiff drink of whisky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So he tried to throw off gloom and apprehension, but he failed. His\n",
      "comrades did not rally to his help. Wilson walked away, nodding his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, let Jim alone,” whispered Shady. “It's orful the way you buck\n",
      "ag'in' him--when you seen he's stirred up. Jim's true blue. But you\n",
      "gotta be careful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze corroborated this statement by gloomy nods.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the card-playing was resumed, Anson did not join the game, and\n",
      "both Moze and Shady evinced little of that whole-hearted obsession which\n",
      "usually attended their gambling. Anson lay at length, his head in a\n",
      "saddle, scowling at the little shelter where the captive girl kept\n",
      "herself out of sight. At times a faint song or laugh, very unnatural,\n",
      "was wafted across the space. Wilson plodded at the cooking and\n",
      "apparently heard no sounds. Presently he called the men to eat, which\n",
      "office they surlily and silently performed, as if it was a favor\n",
      "bestowed upon the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, hadn't I ought to take a bite of grub over to the gurl?” asked\n",
      "Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you hev to ask me thet?” snapped Anson. “She's gotta be fed, if we\n",
      "hev to stuff it down her throat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I ain't stuck on the job,” replied Wilson. “But I'll tackle it,\n",
      "seein' you-all got cold feet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With plate and cup be reluctantly approached the little lean-to, and,\n",
      "kneeling, he put his head inside. The girl, quick-eyed and alert, had\n",
      "evidently seen him coming. At any rate, she greeted him with a cautious\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, was I pretty good?” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, you was shore the finest aktress I ever seen,” he responded, in a\n",
      "low voice. “But you dam near overdid it. I'm goin' to tell Anson you're\n",
      "sick now--poisoned or somethin' awful. Then we'll wait till night. Dale\n",
      "shore will help us out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I'm on fire to get away,” she exclaimed. “Jim Wilson, I'll never\n",
      "forget you as long as I live!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed greatly embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal--miss--I--I'll do my best licks. But I ain't gamblin' none on\n",
      "results. Be patient. Keep your nerve. Don't get scared. I reckon between\n",
      "me an' Dale you'll git away from heah.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Withdrawing his head, he got up and returned to the camp-fire, where\n",
      "Anson was waiting curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I left the grub. But she didn't touch it. Seems sort of sick to me,\n",
      "like she was poisoned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, didn't I hear you talkin'?” asked Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. I was coaxin' her. Reckon she ain't so ranty as she was. But she\n",
      "shore is doubled-up, an' sickish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wuss an' wuss all the time,” said Anson, between his teeth. “An'\n",
      "where's Burt? Hyar it's noon an' he left early. He never was no\n",
      "woodsman. He's got lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Either thet or he's run into somethin',” replied Wilson, thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson doubled a huge fist and cursed deep under his breath--the reaction\n",
      "of a man whose accomplices and partners and tools, whose luck, whose\n",
      "faith in himself had failed him. He flung himself down under a tree, and\n",
      "after a while, when his rigidity relaxed, he probably fell asleep. Moze\n",
      "and Shady kept at their game. Wilson paced to and fro, sat down, and\n",
      "then got up to bunch the horses again, walked around the dell and back\n",
      "to camp. The afternoon hours were long. And they were waiting hours. The\n",
      "act of waiting appeared on the surface of all these outlaws did.\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunset the golden gloom of the glen changed to a vague, thick\n",
      "twilight. Anson rolled over, yawned, and sat up. As he glanced around,\n",
      "evidently seeking Burt, his face clouded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No sign of Burt?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson expressed a mild surprise. “Wal, Snake, you ain't expectin' Burt\n",
      "now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am, course I am. Why not?” demanded Anson. “Any other time we'd look\n",
      "fer him, wouldn't we?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any other time ain't now.... Burt won't ever come back!” Wilson spoke\n",
      "it with a positive finality.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Some more of them queer feelin's of yourn--operatin' again, hey?\n",
      "Them onnatural kind thet you can't explain, hey?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's queries were bitter and rancorous.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. An', Snake, I tax you with this heah. Ain't any of them queer\n",
      "feelin's operatin' in you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” rolled out the leader, savagely. But his passionate denial was a\n",
      "proof that he lied. From the moment of this outburst, which was a fierce\n",
      "clinging to the old, brave instincts of his character, unless a sudden\n",
      "change marked the nature of his fortunes, he would rapidly deteriorate\n",
      "to the breaking-point. And in such brutal, unrestrained natures as his\n",
      "this breaking-point meant a desperate stand, a desperate forcing of\n",
      "events, a desperate accumulation of passions that stalked out to deal\n",
      "and to meet disaster and blood and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson put a little wood on the fire and he munched a biscuit. No one\n",
      "asked him to cook. No one made any effort to do so. One by one each man\n",
      "went to the pack to get some bread and meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they waited as men who knew not what they waited for, yet hated and\n",
      "dreaded it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twilight in that glen was naturally a strange, veiled condition of the\n",
      "atmosphere. It was a merging of shade and light, which two seemed to\n",
      "make gray, creeping shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly a snorting and stamping of the horses startled the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somethin' scared the hosses,” said Anson, rising. “Come on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze accompanied him, and they disappeared in the gloom. More trampling\n",
      "of hoofs was heard, then a cracking of brush, and the deep voices of\n",
      "men. At length the two outlaws returned, leading three of the horses,\n",
      "which they haltered in the open glen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camp-fire light showed Anson's face dark and serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, them hosses are wilder 'n deer,” he said. “I ketched mine, an'\n",
      "Moze got two. But the rest worked away whenever we come close. Some\n",
      "varmint has scared them bad. We all gotta rustle out thar quick.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson rose, shaking his head doubtfully. And at that moment the quiet\n",
      "air split to a piercing, horrid neigh of a terrified horse. Prolonged to\n",
      "a screech, it broke and ended. Then followed snorts of fright, pound and\n",
      "crack and thud of hoofs, and crash of brush; then a gathering thumping,\n",
      "crashing roar, split by piercing sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stampede!” yelled Anson, and he ran to hold his own horse, which he had\n",
      "haltered right in camp. It was big and wild-looking, and now reared and\n",
      "plunged to break away. Anson just got there in time, and then it took\n",
      "all his weight to pull the horse down. Not until the crashing, snorting,\n",
      "pounding melee had subsided and died away over the rim of the glen did\n",
      "Anson dare leave his frightened favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone! Our horses are gone! Did you hear 'em?” he exclaimed, blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. They're a cut-up an' crippled bunch by now,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, we'll never git 'ern back, not 'n a hundred years,” declared\n",
      "Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet settles us, Snake Anson,” stridently added Shady Jones. “Them\n",
      "hosses are gone! You can kiss your hand to them.... They wasn't hobbled.\n",
      "They hed an orful scare. They split on thet stampede an' they'll never\n",

      "\n",
      "Under the force of this triple arraignment the outlaw leader dropped to\n",
      "his seat, staggered and silenced. In fact, silence fell upon all the men\n",
      "and likewise enfolded the glen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night set in jet-black, dismal, lonely, without a star. Faintly the wind\n",
      "moaned. Weirdly the brook babbled through its strange chords to end in\n",
      "the sound that was hollow. It was never the same--a rumble, as if faint,\n",
      "distant thunder--a deep gurgle, as of water drawn into a vortex--a\n",
      "rolling, as of a stone in swift current. The black cliff was invisible,\n",
      "yet seemed to have many weird faces; the giant pines loomed spectral;\n",
      "the shadows were thick, moving, changing. Flickering lights from the\n",
      "camp-fire circled the huge trunks and played fantastically over the\n",
      "brooding men. This camp-fire did not burn or blaze cheerily; it had no\n",
      "glow, no sputter, no white heart, no red, living embers. One by one the\n",
      "outlaws, as if with common consent, tried their hands at making the fire\n",
      "burn aright. What little wood had been collected was old; it would burn\n",
      "up with false flare, only to die quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while not one of the outlaws spoke or stirred. Not one smoked.\n",
      "Their gloomy eyes were fixed on the fire. Each one was concerned with\n",
      "his own thoughts, his own lonely soul unconsciously full of a doubt of\n",
      "the future. That brooding hour severed him from comrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "At night nothing seemed the same as it was by day. With success and\n",
      "plenty, with full-blooded action past and more in store, these outlaws\n",
      "were as different from their present state as this black night was\n",
      "different from the bright day they waited for. Wilson, though he played\n",
      "a deep game of deceit for the sake of the helpless girl--and thus did\n",
      "not have haunting and superstitious fears on her account--was probably\n",
      "more conscious of impending catastrophe than any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evil they had done spoke in the voice of nature, out of the\n",
      "darkness, and was interpreted by each according to his hopes and fears.\n",
      "Fear was their predominating sense. For years they had lived with some\n",
      "species of fear--of honest men or vengeance, of pursuit, of starvation,\n",
      "of lack of drink or gold, of blood and death, of stronger men, of luck,\n",
      "of chance, of fate, of mysterious nameless force. Wilson was the type of\n",
      "fearless spirit, but he endured the most gnawing and implacable fear of\n",
      "all--that of himself--that he must inevitably fall to deeds beneath his\n",
      "manhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they hunched around the camp-fire, brooding because hope was at\n",
      "lowest ebb; listening because the weird, black silence, with its moan\n",
      "of wind and hollow laugh of brook, compelled them to hear; waiting for\n",
      "sleep, for the hours to pass, for whatever was to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was Anson who caught the first intimation of an impending doom.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Listen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson whispered tensely. His poise was motionless, his eyes roved\n",
      "everywhere. He held up a shaking, bludgy finger, to command silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third and stranger sound accompanied the low, weird moan of the wind,\n",
      "and the hollow mockery of the brook--and it seemed a barely perceptible,\n",
      "exquisitely delicate wail or whine. It filled in the lulls between the\n",
      "other sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If thet's some varmint he's close,” whispered Anson.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Shady Jones and Moze divided their opinions in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "All breathed freer when the wail ceased, relaxing to their former\n",
      "lounging positions around the fire. An impenetrable wall of blackness\n",
      "circled the pale space lighted by the camp-fire; and this circle\n",
      "contained the dark, somber group of men in the center, the dying\n",
      "camp-fire, and a few spectral trunks of pines and the tethered horses on\n",
      "the outer edge. The horses scarcely moved from their tracks, and their\n",
      "erect, alert heads attested to their sensitiveness to the peculiarities\n",
      "of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, at an unusually quiet lull the strange sound gradually arose to a\n",
      "wailing whine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's thet crazy wench cryin',” declared the outlaw leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently his allies accepted that statement with as much relief as\n",
      "they had expressed for the termination of the sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, thet must be it,” agreed Jim Wilson, gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll git a lot of sleep with thet gurl whinin' all night,” growled\n",
      "Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She gives me the creeps,” said Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson got up to resume his pondering walk, head bent, hands behind his\n",
      "back, a grim, realistic figure of perturbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--set down. You make me nervous,” said Anson, irritably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson actually laughed, but low, as if to keep his strange mirth well\n",
      "confined.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, I'll bet you my hoss an' my gun ag'in' a biscuit thet in aboot\n",
      "six seconds more or less I'll be stampedin like them hosses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's lean jaw dropped. The other two outlaws stared with round\n",
      "eyes. Wilson was not drunk, they evidently knew; but what he really was\n",
      "appeared a mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim Wilson, are you showin' yellow?” queried Anson, hoarsely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe. The Lord only knows. But listen heah.... Snake, you've seen an'\n",
      "heard people croak?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Shore.”\n",

      "“Wal, yes--a couple or so,” replied Anson, grimly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you never seen no one die of shock--of an orful scare?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I reckon I never did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have. An' thet's what's ailin' Jim Wilson,” and he resumed his dogged\n",
      "steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson and his two comrades exchanged bewildered glances with one\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! Say, what's thet got to do with us hyar? asked Anson, presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet gurl is dyin'!” retorted Wilson, in a voice cracking like a whip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three outlaws stiffened in their seats, incredulous, yet\n",
      "irresistibly swayed by emotions that stirred to this dark, lonely,\n",
      "ill-omened hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson trudged to the edge of the lighted circle, muttering to himself,\n",
      "and came back again; then he trudged farther, this time almost out\n",
      "of sight, but only to return; the third time he vanished in the\n",
      "impenetrable wall of light. The three men scarcely moved a muscle as\n",
      "they watched the place where he had disappeared. In a few moments he\n",
      "came stumbling back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore she's almost gone,” he said, dismally. “It took my nerve, but\n",
      "I felt of her face.... Thet orful wail is her breath chokin' in her\n",
      "throat.... Like a death-rattle, only long instead of short.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if she's gotta croak it's good she gits it over quick,” replied\n",
      "Anson. “I 'ain't hed sleep fer three nights. ... An' what I need is\n",
      "whisky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, thet's gospel you're spoutin',” remarked Shady Jones, morosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The direction of sound in the glen was difficult to be assured of, but\n",
      "any man not stirred to a high pitch of excitement could have told that\n",
      "the difference in volume of this strange wail must have been caused by\n",
      "different distances and positions. Also, when it was loudest, it was\n",
      "most like a whine. But these outlaws heard with their consciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last it ceased abruptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson again left the group to be swallowed up by the night. His absence\n",
      "was longer than usual, but he returned hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She's daid!” he exclaimed, solemnly. “Thet innocent kid--who never\n",
      "harmed no one--an' who'd make any man better fer seein' her--she's\n",
      "daid!... Anson, you've shore a heap to answer fer when your time comes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's eatin' you?” demanded the leader, angrily. “Her blood ain't on\n",
      "my hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It shore is,” shouted Wilson, shaking his hand at Anson. “An' you'll\n",
      "hev to take your medicine. I felt thet comin' all along. An' I feel some\n",
      "more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw! She's jest gone to sleep,” declared Anson, shaking his long frame\n",
      "as he rose. “Gimme a light.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, you're plumb off to go near a dead gurl thet's jest died crazy,”\n",
      " protested Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Off! Haw! Haw! Who ain't off in this outfit, I'd like to know?” Anson\n",
      "possessed himself of a stick blazing at one and, and with this he\n",
      "stalked off toward the lean-to where the girl was supposed to be dead.\n",
      "His gaunt figure, lighted by the torch, certainly fitted the weird,\n",
      "black surroundings. And it was seen that once near the girl's shelter he\n",
      "proceeded more slowly, until he halted. He bent to peer inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“SHE'S GONE!” he yelled, in harsh, shaken accents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Than the torch burned out, leaving only a red glow. He whirled it about,\n",
      "but the blaze did not rekindle. His comrades, peering intently, lost\n",
      "sight of his tall form and the end of the red-ended stick. Darkness like\n",
      "pitch swallowed him. For a moment no sound intervened. Again the moan of\n",
      "wind, the strange little mocking hollow roar, dominated the place. Then\n",
      "there came a rush of something, perhaps of air, like the soft swishing\n",
      "of spruce branches swinging aside. Dull, thudding footsteps followed it.\n",
      "Anson came running back to the fire. His aspect was wild, his face pale,\n",
      "his eyes were fierce and starting from their sockets. He had drawn his\n",
      "gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did--ye--see er hear--anythin'?” he panted, peering back, then all\n",
      "around, and at last at his man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. An' I shore was lookin' an' listenin',” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, there wasn't nothin',” declared Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I ain't so sartin,” said Shady Jones, with doubtful, staring eyes. “I\n",
      "believe I heerd a rustlin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She wasn't there!” ejaculated Anson, in wondering awe. “She's gone!...\n",
      "My torch went out. I couldn't see. An' jest then I felt somethin' was\n",
      "passin'. Fast! I jerked 'round. All was black, an' yet if I didn't see\n",
      "a big gray streak I'm crazier 'n thet gurl. But I couldn't swear to\n",
      "anythin' but a rushin' of wind. I felt thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone!” exclaimed Wilson, in great alarm. “Fellars, if thet's so, then\n",
      "mebbe she wasn't daid an' she wandered off. ... But she was daid! Her\n",
      "heart hed quit beatin'. I'll swear to thet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I move to break camp,” said Shady Jones, gruffly, and he stood up. Moze\n",
      "seconded that move by an expressive flash of his black visage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, if she's dead--an' gone--what 'n hell's come off?” huskily asked\n",
      "Anson. “It, only seems thet way. We're all worked up.... Let's talk\n",
      "sense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anson, shore there's a heap you an' me don't know,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "“The world come to an end once. Wal, it can come to another end.... I\n",
      "tell you I ain't surprised--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“THAR!” cried Anson, whirling, with his gun leaping out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something huge, shadowy, gray against the black rushed behind the men\n",
      "and trees; and following it came a perceptible acceleration of the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, Snake, there wasn't nothin',” said Wilson, “presently.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heerd,” whispered Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was only a breeze blowin' thet smoke,” rejoined Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'd bet my soul somethin' went back of me,” declared Anson, glaring\n",
      "into the void.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen an' let's make shore,” suggested Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guilty, agitated faces of the outlaws showed plain enough in the\n",
      "flickering light for each to see a convicting dread in his fellow. Like\n",
      "statues they stood, watching and listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few sounds stirred in the strange silence. Now and then the horses\n",
      "heaved heavily, but stood still; a dismal, dreary note of the wind in\n",
      "the pines vied with a hollow laugh of the brook. And these low sounds\n",
      "only fastened attention upon the quality of the silence. A breathing,\n",
      "lonely spirit of solitude permeated the black dell. Like a pit of\n",
      "unplumbed depths the dark night yawned. An evil conscience, listening\n",
      "there, could have heard the most peaceful, beautiful, and mournful\n",
      "sounds of nature only as strains of a calling hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the silent, oppressive, surcharged air split to a short,\n",
      "piercing scream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's big horse stood up straight, pawing the air, and came down with\n",
      "a crash. The other horses shook with terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wasn't--thet--a cougar?” whispered Anson, thickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet was a woman's scream,” replied Wilson, and he appeared to be\n",
      "shaking like a leaf in the wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then--I figgered right--the kid's alive--wonderin' around--an' she let\n",
      "out thet orful scream,” said Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wonderin' 'round, yes--but she's daid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Gawd! it ain't possible!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if she ain't wonderin' round daid she's almost daid,” replied\n",
      "Wilson. And he began to whisper to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I'd only knowed what thet deal meant I'd hev plugged Beasley instead\n",
      "of listenin'.... An' I ought to hev knocked thet kid on the head an'\n",
      "made sartin she'd croaked. If she goes screamin' 'round thet way--”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice failed as there rose a thin, splitting, high-pointed shriek,\n",
      "somewhat resembling the first scream, only less wild. It came apparently\n",
      "from the cliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "From another point in the pitch-black glen rose the wailing, terrible\n",
      "cry of a woman in agony. Wild, haunting, mournful wail!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson's horse, loosing the halter, plunged back, almost falling over a\n",
      "slight depression in the rocky ground. The outlaw caught him and dragged\n",
      "him nearer the fire. The other horses stood shaking and straining. Moze\n",
      "ran between them and held them. Shady Jones threw green brush on the\n",
      "fire. With sputter and crackle a blaze started, showing Wilson standing\n",
      "tragically, his arms out, facing the black shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strange, live shriek was not repeated. But the cry, like that of\n",
      "a woman in her death-throes, pierced the silence again. It left a\n",
      "quivering ring that softly died away. Then the stillness clamped down\n",
      "once more and the darkness seemed to thicken. The men waited, and when\n",
      "they had begun to relax the cry burst out appallingly close, right\n",
      "behind the trees. It was human--the personification of pain and\n",
      "terror--the tremendous struggle of precious life against horrible death.\n",
      "So pure, so exquisite, so wonderful was the cry that the listeners\n",
      "writhed as if they saw an innocent, tender, beautiful girl torn\n",
      "frightfully before their eyes. It was full of suspense; it thrilled\n",
      "for death; its marvelous potency was the wild note--that beautiful and\n",
      "ghastly note of self-preservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In sheer desperation the outlaw leader fired his gun at the black wall\n",
      "whence the cry came. Then he had to fight his horse to keep him from\n",
      "plunging away. Following the shot was an interval of silence; the horses\n",
      "became tractable; the men gathered closer to the fire, with the halters\n",
      "still held firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it was a cougar--thet 'd scare him off,” said Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, but it ain't a cougar,” replied Wilson. “Wait an' see!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They all waited, listening with ears turned to different points, eyes\n",
      "roving everywhere, afraid of their very shadows. Once more the moan of\n",
      "wind, the mockery of brook, deep gurgle, laugh and babble, dominated the\n",
      "silence of the glen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, let's shake this spooky hole,” whispered Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion attracted Anson, and he pondered it while slowly shaking\n",
      "his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We've only three hosses. An' mine 'll take ridin'--after them squalls,”\n",
      " replied the leader. “We've got packs, too. An' hell 'ain't nothin' on\n",
      "this place fer bein' dark.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter. Let's go. I'll walk an' lead the way,” said Moze, eagerly.\n",
      "“I got sharp eyes. You fellars can ride an' carry a pack. We'll git out\n",
      "of here an' come back in daylight fer the rest of the outfit.”\n",

      "“Anson, I'm keen fer thet myself,” declared Shady Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, what d'ye say to thet?” queried Anson. “Rustlin' out of this black\n",
      "hole?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's a grand idee,” agreed Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet was a cougar,” avowed Anson, gathering courage as the silence\n",
      "remained unbroken. “But jest the same it was as tough on me as if it hed\n",
      "been a woman screamin' over a blade twistin' in her gizzards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, shore you seen a woman heah lately?” deliberately asked Wilson.\n",
      "\n",

      "“'An' she wasn't heah when you went huntin' fer her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Correct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, if thet's so, what do you want to blab about cougars for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's argument seemed incontestable. Shady and Moze nodded gloomily\n",
      "and shifted restlessly from foot to foot. Anson dropped his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter--if we only don't hear--” he began, suddenly to grow mute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right upon them, from some place, just out the circle of light, rose a\n",
      "scream, by reason of its proximity the most piercing and agonizing yet\n",
      "heard, simply petrifying the group until the peal passed. Anson's huge\n",
      "horse reared, and with a snort of terror lunged in tremendous leap,\n",
      "straight out. He struck Anson with thudding impact, knocking him over\n",
      "the rocks into the depression back of the camp-fire, and plunging after\n",
      "him. Wilson had made a flying leap just in time to avoid being struck,\n",
      "and he turned to see Anson go down. There came a crash, a groan, and\n",
      "then the strike and pound of hoofs as the horse struggled up. Apparently\n",
      "he had rolled over his master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Help, fellars!” yelled Wilson, quick to leap down over the little bank,\n",
      "and in the dim light to grasp the halter. The three men dragged the\n",
      "horse out and securely tied him close to a tree. That done, they\n",
      "peered down into the depression. Anson's form could just barely be\n",
      "distinguished in the gloom. He lay stretched out. Another groan escaped\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore I'm scared he's hurt,” said Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hoss rolled right on top of him. An' thet hoss's heavy,” declared Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "They got down and knelt beside their leader. In the darkness his face\n",
      "looked dull gray. His breathing was not right.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, old man, you ain't--hurt?” asked Wilson, with a tremor in his\n",
      "voice. Receiving no reply, he said to his comrades, “Lay hold an' we'll\n",
      "heft him up where we can see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three men carefully lifted Anson up on the bank and laid him near\n",
      "the fire in the light. Anson was conscious. His face was ghastly. Blood\n",
      "showed on his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson knelt beside him. The other outlaws stood up, and with one dark\n",
      "gaze at one another damned Anson's chance of life. And on the instant\n",
      "rose that terrible distressing scream of acute agony--like that of a\n",
      "woman being dismembered. Shady Jones whispered something to Moze. Then\n",
      "they stood up, gazing down at their fallen leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me where you're hurt?” asked Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He--smashed--my chest,” said Anson, in a broken, strangled whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson's deft hands opened the outlaw's shirt and felt of his chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Shore your breast-bone ain't smashed,” replied Wilson, hopefully.\n",
      "And he began to run his hand around one side of Anson's body and then\n",
      "the other. Abruptly he stopped, averted his gaze, then slowly ran the\n",
      "hand all along that side. Anson's ribs had been broken and crushed in\n",
      "by the weight of the horse. He was bleeding at the mouth, and his slow,\n",
      "painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth, which showed that\n",
      "the broken bones had penetrated the lungs. An injury sooner or later\n",
      "fatal!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pard, you busted a rib or two,” said Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Jim--it must be--wuss 'n thet!” he whispered. “I'm--in orful--pain.\n",
      "An' I can't--git any--breath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mebbe you'll be better,” said Wilson, with a cheerfulness his face\n",
      "belied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moze bent close over Anson, took a short scrutiny of that ghastly face,\n",
      "at the blood-stained lips, and the lean hands plucking at nothing. Then\n",
      "he jerked erect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shady, he's goin' to cash. Let's clear out of this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm yours pertickler previous,” replied Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both turned away. They untied the two horses and led them up to where\n",
      "the saddles lay. Swiftly the blankets went on, swiftly the saddles\n",
      "swung up, swiftly the cinches snapped. Anson lay gazing up at Wilson,\n",
      "comprehending this move. And Wilson stood strangely grim and silent,\n",
      "somehow detached coldly from that self of the past few hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shady, you grab some bread an' I'll pack a bunk of meat,” said Moze.\n",
      "Both men came near the fire, into the light, within ten feet of where\n",
      "the leader lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fellars--you ain't--slopin'?” he whispered, in husky amaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, we air thet same. We can't do you no good an' this hole ain't\n",
      "healthy,” replied Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shady Jones swung himself astride his horse, all about him sharp, eager,\n",
      "strung.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Moze, I'll tote the grub an' you lead out of hyar, till we git past the\n",
      "wust timber,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw, Moze--you wouldn't leave--Jim hyar--alone,” implored Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim can stay till he rots,” retorted Moze. “I've hed enough of this\n",
      "hole.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Moze--it ain't square--” panted Anson. “Jim wouldn't--leave me.\n",
      "I'd stick--by you.... I'll make it--all up to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snake, you're goin' to cash,” sardonically returned Moze.\n",
      "\n",
      "A current leaped all through Anson's stretched frame. His ghastly face\n",
      "blazed. That was the great and the terrible moment which for long had\n",
      "been in abeyance. Wilson had known grimly that it would come, by one\n",
      "means or another. Anson had doggedly and faithfully struggled against\n",
      "the tide of fatal issues. Moze and Shady Jones, deep locked in their\n",
      "self-centered motives, had not realized the inevitable trend of their\n",
      "dark lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anson, prostrate as he was, swiftly drew his gun and shot Moze. Without\n",
      "sound or movement of hand Moze fell. Then the plunge of Shady's horse\n",
      "caused Anson's second shot to miss. A quick third shot brought no\n",
      "apparent result but Shady's cursing resort to his own weapon. He tried\n",
      "to aim from his plunging horse. His bullets spattered dust and gravel\n",
      "over Anson. Then Wilson's long arm stretched and his heavy gun banged.\n",
      "Shady collapsed in the saddle, and the frightened horse, throwing him,\n",
      "plunged out of the circle of light. Thudding hoofs, crashings of brush,\n",
      "quickly ceased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--did you--git him?” whispered Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore did, Snake,” was the slow, halting response. Jim Wilson must have\n",
      "sustained a sick shudder as he replied. Sheathing his gun, he folded a\n",
      "blanket and put it under Anson's head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--my feet--air orful cold,” whispered Anson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, it's gittin' chilly,” replied Wilson, and, taking a second\n",
      "blanket, he laid that over Anson's limbs. “Snake, I'm feared Shady hit\n",
      "you once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-huh! But not so I'd care--much--if I hed--no wuss hurt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You lay still now. Reckon Shady's hoss stopped out heah a ways. An'\n",
      "I'll see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim--I 'ain't heerd--thet scream fer--a little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it's gone.... Reckon now thet was a cougar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knowed it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson stalked away into the darkness. That inky wall did not seem so\n",
      "impenetrable and black after he had gotten out of the circle of light.\n",
      "He proceeded carefully and did not make any missteps. He groped from\n",
      "tree to tree toward the cliff and presently brought up against a huge\n",
      "flat rock as high as his head. Here the darkness was blackest, yet he\n",
      "was able to see a light form on the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss, are you there--all right?” he called, softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but I'm scared to death,” she whispered in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore it wound up sudden. Come now. I reckon your trouble's over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He helped her off the rock, and, finding her unsteady on her feet, he\n",
      "supported her with one arm and held the other out in front of him to\n",
      "feel for objects. Foot by foot they worked out from under the dense\n",
      "shadow of the cliff, following the course of the little brook. It\n",
      "babbled and gurgled, and almost drowned the low whistle Wilson sent out.\n",
      "The girl dragged heavily upon him now, evidently weakening. At length he\n",
      "reached the little open patch at the head of the ravine. Halting here,\n",
      "he whistled. An answer came from somewhere behind him and to the right.\n",
      "Wilson waited, with the girl hanging on his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale's heah,” he said. “An' don't you keel over now--after all the\n",
      "nerve you hed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A swishing of brush, a step, a soft, padded footfall; a looming, dark\n",
      "figure, and a long, low gray shape, stealthily moving--it was the last\n",
      "of these that made Wilson jump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson!” came Dale's subdued voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heah. I've got her, Dale. Safe an sound,” replied Wilson, stepping\n",
      "toward the tall form. And he put the drooping girl into Dale's arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo! Bo! You're all right?” Dale's deep voice was tremulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "She roused up to seize him and to utter little cries of joy\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Dale!... Oh, thank Heaven! I'm ready to drop now.... Hasn't it been\n",
      "a night--an adventure?... I'm well--safe--sound.... Dale, we owe it to\n",
      "this Jim Wilson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I--we'll all thank him--all our lives,” replied Dale. “Wilson,\n",
      "you're a man!... If you'll shake that gang--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, shore there ain't much of a gang left, onless you let Burt git\n",
      "away,” replied Wilson.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn't kill him--or hurt him. But I scared him so I'll bet he's\n",
      "runnin' yet.... Wilson, did all the shootin' mean a fight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tolerable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Dale, it was terrible! I saw it all. I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Miss, you can tell him after I go.... I'm wishin' you good luck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice was a cool, easy drawl, slightly tremulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl's face flashed white in the gloom. She pressed against the\n",
      "outlaw--wrung his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heaven help you, Jim Wilson! You ARE from Texas!... I'll remember\n",
      "you--pray for you all my life!”\n",

      "CHAPTER XXIV\n",
      "\n",
      "As Helen Rayner watched Dale ride away on a quest perilous to him, and\n",
      "which meant almost life or death for her, it was surpassing strange that\n",
      "she could think of nothing except the thrilling, tumultuous moment when\n",
      "she had put her arms round his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not matter that Dale--splendid fellow that he was--had made\n",
      "the ensuing moment free of shame by taking her action as he had taken\n",
      "it--the fact that she had actually done it was enough. How utterly\n",
      "impossible for her to anticipate her impulses or to understand them,\n",
      "once they were acted upon! Confounding realization then was that when\n",
      "Dale returned with her sister, Helen knew she would do the same thing\n",
      "over again!\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I do--I won't be two-faced about it,” she soliloquized, and a hot\n",
      "blush flamed her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "She watched Dale until he rode out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had gone, worry and dread replaced this other confusing emotion.\n",
      "She turned to the business of meeting events. Before supper she packed\n",
      "her valuables and books, papers, and clothes, together with Bo's, and\n",
      "had them in readiness so if she was forced to vacate the premises she\n",
      "would have her personal possessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mormon boys and several other of her trusted men slept in their\n",
      "tarpaulin beds on the porch of the ranch-house that night, so that Helen\n",
      "at least would not be surprised. But the day came, with its manifold\n",
      "duties undisturbed by any event. And it passed slowly with the leaden\n",
      "feet of listening, watching vigilance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael did not come back, nor was there news of him to be had. The\n",
      "last known of him had been late the afternoon of the preceding day, when\n",
      "a sheep-herder had seen him far out on the north range, headed for the\n",
      "hills. The Beemans reported that Roy's condition had improved, and also\n",
      "that there was a subdued excitement of suspense down in the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second lonely night was almost unendurable for Helen. When she\n",
      "slept it was to dream horrible dreams; when she lay awake it was to have\n",
      "her heart leap to her throat at a rustle of leaves near the window, and\n",
      "to be in torture of imagination as to poor Bo's plight. A thousand times\n",
      "Helen said to herself that Beasley could have had the ranch and welcome,\n",
      "if only Bo had been spared. Helen absolutely connected her enemy with\n",
      "her sister's disappearance. Riggs might have been a means to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight was not attended by so many fears; there were things to do\n",
      "that demanded attention. And thus it was that the next morning, shortly\n",
      "before noon, she was recalled to her perplexities by a shouting out at\n",
      "the corrals and a galloping of horses somewhere near. From the window\n",
      "she saw a big smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fire! That must be one of the barns--the old one, farthest out,”\n",
      " she said, gazing out of the window. “Some careless Mexican with his\n",
      "everlasting cigarette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen resisted an impulse to go out and see what had happened. She had\n",
      "decided to stay in the house. But when footsteps sounded on the porch\n",
      "and a rap on the door, she unhesitatingly opened it. Four Mexicans stood\n",
      "close. One of them, quick as thought, flashed a hand in to grasp her,\n",
      "and in a single motion pulled her across the threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No hurt, Senora,” he said, and pointed--making motions she must go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen did not need to be told what this visit meant. Many as her\n",
      "conjectures had been, however, she had not thought of Beasley subjecting\n",
      "her to this outrage. And her blood boiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dare you!” she said, trembling in her effort to control her temper.\n",
      "But class, authority, voice availed nothing with these swarthy Mexicans.\n",
      "They grinned. Another laid hold of Helen with dirty, brown hand. She\n",
      "shrank from the contact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let go!” she burst out, furiously. And instinctively she began to\n",
      "struggle to free herself. Then they all took hold of her. Helen's\n",
      "dignity might never have been! A burning, choking rush of blood was\n",
      "her first acquaintance with the terrible passion of anger that was her\n",
      "inheritance from the Auchinclosses. She who had resolved never to lay\n",
      "herself open to indignity now fought like a tigress. The Mexicans,\n",
      "jabbering in their excitement, had all they could do, until they\n",
      "lifted her bodily from the porch. They handled her as if she had been a\n",
      "half-empty sack of corn. One holding each hand and foot they packed her,\n",
      "with dress disarranged and half torn off, down the path to the lane and\n",
      "down the lane to the road. There they stood upright and pushed her off\n",
      "her property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through half-blind eyes Helen saw them guarding the gateway, ready to\n",
      "prevent her entrance. She staggered down the road to the village.\n",
      "It seemed she made her way through a red dimness--that there was a\n",
      "congestion in her brain--that the distance to Mrs. Cass's cottage was\n",
      "insurmountable. But she got there, to stagger up the path, to hear the\n",
      "old woman's cry. Dizzy, faint, sick, with a blackness enveloping all she\n",
      "looked at, Helen felt herself led into the sitting-room and placed in\n",
      "the big chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently sight and clearness of mind returned to her. She saw Roy,\n",
      "white as a sheet, questioning her with terrible eyes. The old woman\n",
      "hung murmuring over her, trying to comfort her as well as fasten the\n",
      "disordered dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four greasers--packed me down--the hill--threw me off my ranch--into\n",
      "the road!” panted Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seemed to tell this also to her own consciousness and to realize the\n",
      "mighty wave of danger that shook her whole body.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I'd known--I would have killed them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She exclaimed that, full-voiced and hard, with dry, hot eyes on her\n",
      "friends. Roy reached out to take her hand, speaking huskily. Helen\n",
      "did not distinguish what he said. The frightened old woman knelt, with\n",
      "unsteady fingers fumbling over the rents in Helen's dress. The moment\n",
      "came when Helen's quivering began to subside, when her blood quieted\n",
      "to let her reason sway, when she began to do battle with her rage, and\n",
      "slowly to take fearful stock of this consuming peril that had been a\n",
      "sleeping tigress in her veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Miss Helen, you looked so turrible, I made sure you was hurted,”\n",
      " the old woman was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gazed strangely at her bruised wrists, at the one stocking that\n",
      "hung down over her shoe-top, at the rent which had bared her shoulder to\n",
      "the profane gaze of those grinning, beady-eyed Mexicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My body's--not hurt,” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy had lost some of his whiteness, and where his eyes had been fierce\n",
      "they were now kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Miss Nell, it's lucky no harm's done.... Now if you'll only see\n",
      "this whole deal clear!... Not let it spoil your sweet way of lookin' an'\n",
      "hopin'! If you can only see what's raw in this West--an' love it jest\n",
      "the same!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen only half divined his meaning, but that was enough for a future\n",
      "reflection. The West was beautiful, but hard. In the faces of these\n",
      "friends she began to see the meaning of the keen, sloping lines, and\n",
      "shadows of pain, of a lean, naked truth, cut as from marble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the land's sakes, tell us all about it,” importuned Mrs. Cass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon Helen shut her eyes and told the brief narrative of her\n",
      "expulsion from her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore we-all expected thet,” said Roy. “An' it's jest as well you're\n",

      "all sooner hev you away from thet ranch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Roy, I won't let Beasley stay there,” cried Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Nell, shore by the time this here Pine has growed big enough fer\n",
      "law you'll hev gray in thet pretty hair. You can't put Beasley off with\n",
      "your honest an' rightful claim. Al Auchincloss was a hard driver. He\n",

      "“Oh, what can I do? I won't give up. I've been robbed. Can't the people\n",

      "thief--Oh, it's unbelievable!”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before noon that day the baggage Helen had packed at home was left on\n",
      "the porch of Widow Cass's cottage, and Helen's anxious need of the hour\n",
      "was satisfied. She was made comfortable in the old woman's one spare\n",
      "room, and she set herself the task of fortitude and endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her surprise, many of Mrs. Cass's neighbors came unobtrusively to\n",
      "the back door of the little cottage and made sympathetic inquiries. They\n",
      "appeared a subdued and apprehensive group, and whispered to one another\n",
      "as they left. Helen gathered from their visits a conviction that the\n",
      "wives of the men dominated by Beasley believed no good could come of\n",
      "this high-handed taking over of the ranch. Indeed, Helen found at the\n",
      "end of the day that a strength had been borne of her misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Roy informed her that his brother John had come down the\n",
      "preceding night with the news of Beasley's descent upon the ranch. Not a\n",
      "shot had been fired, and the only damage done was that of the burning of\n",
      "a hay-filled barn. This had been set on fire to attract Helen's men to\n",
      "one spot, where Beasley had ridden down upon them with three times their\n",
      "number. He had boldly ordered them off the land, unless they wanted to\n",
      "acknowledge him boss and remain there in his service. The three Beemans\n",
      "had stayed, having planned that just in this event they might be\n",
      "valuable to Helen's interests. Beasley had ridden down into Pine the\n",
      "same as upon any other day. Roy reported also news which had come in\n",
      "that morning, how Beasley's crowd had celebrated late the night before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second and third and fourth days endlessly wore away, and Helen\n",
      "believed they had made her old. At night she lay awake most of the time,\n",
      "thinking and praying, but during the afternoon she got some sleep. She\n",
      "could think of nothing and talk of nothing except her sister, and Dale's\n",
      "chances of saving her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, shore you pay Dale a pore compliment,” finally protested the\n",
      "patient Roy. “I tell you--Milt Dale can do anythin' he wants to do in\n",
      "the woods. You can believe thet. ... But I reckon he'll run chances\n",
      "after he comes back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This significant speech thrilled Helen with its assurance of hope, and\n",
      "made her blood curdle at the implied peril awaiting the hunter.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the afternoon of the fifth day Helen was abruptly awakened from her\n",
      "nap. The sun had almost set. She heard voices--the shrill, cackling\n",
      "notes of old Mrs. Cass, high in excitement, a deep voice that made Helen\n",
      "tingle all over, a girl's laugh, broken but happy. There were footsteps\n",
      "and stamping of hoofs. Dale had brought Bo back! Helen knew it. She grew\n",
      "very weak, and had to force herself to stand erect. Her heart began to\n",
      "pound in her very ears. A sweet and perfect joy suddenly flooded her\n",
      "soul. She thanked God her prayers had been answered. Then suddenly alive\n",
      "with sheer mad physical gladness, she rushed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was just in time to see Roy Beeman stalk out as if he had never been\n",
      "shot, and with a yell greet a big, gray-clad, gray-faced man--Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Roy! Glad to see you up,” said Dale. How the quiet voice\n",
      "steadied Helen! She beheld Bo. Bo, looking the same, except a little\n",
      "pale and disheveled! Then Bo saw her and leaped at her, into her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell! I'm here! Safe--all right! Never was so happy in my life....\n",
      "Oh-h! talk about your adventures! Nell, you dear old mother to me--I've\n",
      "had e-enough forever!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was wild with joy, and by turns she laughed and cried. But Helen\n",
      "could not voice her feelings. Her eyes were so dim that she could\n",
      "scarcely see Dale when he loomed over her as she held Bo. But he found\n",
      "the hand she put shakily out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell!... Reckon it's been harder--on you.” His voice was earnest and\n",
      "halting. She felt his searching gaze upon her face. “Mrs. Cass said you\n",
      "were here. An' I know why.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy led them all indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, one of the neighbor boys will take care of thet hoss,” he said,\n",
      "as Dale turned toward the dusty and weary Ranger. “Where'd you leave the\n",
      "cougar?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sent him home,” replied Date.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Laws now, Milt, if this ain't grand!” cackled Mrs. Cass. “We've worried\n",
      "some here. An' Miss Helen near starved a-hopin' fer you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother, I reckon the girl an' I are nearer starved than anybody you\n",
      "know,” replied Dale, with a grim laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fer the land's sake! I'll be fixin' supper this minit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, why are you here?” asked Bo, suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "For answer Helen led her sister into the spare room and closed the door.\n",
      "Bo saw the baggage. Her expression changed. The old blaze leaped to the\n",
      "telltale eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's done it!” she cried, hotly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dearest--thank God. I've got you--back again!” murmured Helen, finding\n",
      "her voice. “Nothing else matters!... I've prayed only for that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good old Nell!” whispered Bo, and she kissed and embraced Helen. “You\n",
      "really mean that, I know. But nix for yours truly! I'm back alive and\n",
      "kicking, you bet.... Where's my--where's Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, not a word has been heard of him for five days. He's searching for\n",
      "you, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you've been--been put off the ranch?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, rather,” replied Helen, and in a few trembling words she told the\n",
      "story of her eviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo uttered a wild word that had more force than elegance, but it became\n",
      "her passionate resentment of this outrage done her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!... Does Tom Carmichael know this?” she added, breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When he finds out, then--Oh, won't there be hell? I'm glad I got here\n",
      "first.... Nell, my boots haven't been off the whole blessed time. Help\n",
      "me. And oh, for some soap and hot water and some clean clothes! Nell,\n",
      "old girl, I wasn't raised right for these Western deals. Too luxurious!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Helen had her ears filled with a rapid-fire account of running\n",
      "horses and Riggs and outlaws and Beasley called boldly to his teeth, and\n",
      "a long ride and an outlaw who was a hero--a fight with Riggs--blood and\n",
      "death--another long ride--a wild camp in black woods--night--lonely,\n",
      "ghostly sounds--and day again--plot--a great actress lost to the\n",
      "world--Ophelia--Snakes and Ansons--hoodooed outlaws--mournful moans\n",
      "and terrible cries--cougar--stampede--fight and shots, more blood and\n",
      "death--Wilson hero--another Tom Carmichael--fallen in love with outlaw\n",
      "gun-fighter if--black night and Dale and horse and rides and starved\n",
      "and, “Oh, Nell, he WAS from Texas!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gathered that wonderful and dreadful events had hung over\n",
      "the bright head of this beloved little sister, but the bewilderment\n",
      "occasioned by Bo's fluent and remarkable utterance left only that last\n",
      "sentence clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently Helen got a word in to inform Bo that Mrs. Cass had knocked\n",
      "twice for supper, and that welcome news checked Bo's flow of speech when\n",
      "nothing else seemed adequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was obvious to Helen that Roy and Dale had exchanged stories. Roy\n",
      "celebrated this reunion by sitting at table the first time since he\n",
      "had been shot; and despite Helen's misfortune and the suspended waiting\n",
      "balance in the air the occasion was joyous. Old Mrs. Cass was in the\n",
      "height of her glory. She sensed a romance here, and, true to her sex,\n",
      "she radiated to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight was still lingering when Roy got up and went out on the porch.\n",
      "His keen ears had heard something. Helen fancied she herself had heard\n",
      "rapid hoof-beats.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale, come out!” called Roy, sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hunter moved with his swift, noiseless agility. Helen and Bo\n",
      "followed, halting in the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet's Las Vegas,” whispered Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Helen it seemed that the cowboy's name changed the very atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voices were heard at the gate; one that, harsh and quick, sounded like\n",
      "Carmichael's. And a spirited horse was pounding and scattering\n",
      "gravel. Then a lithe figure appeared, striding up the path. It was\n",
      "Carmichael--yet not the Carmichael Helen knew. She heard Bo's strange\n",
      "little cry, a corroboration of her own impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy might never have been shot, judging from the way he stepped out,\n",
      "and Dale was almost as quick. Carmichael reached them--grasped them with\n",
      "swift, hard hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boys--I jest rode in. An' they said you'd found her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore, Las Vegas. Dale fetched her home safe an' sound.... There she\n",
      "is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy thrust aside the two men, and with a long stride he faced the\n",
      "porch, his piercing eyes on the door. All that Helen could think of his\n",
      "look was that it seemed terrible. Bo stepped outside in front of Helen.\n",
      "Probably she would have run straight into Carmichael's arms if some\n",
      "strange instinct had not withheld her. Helen judged it to be fear; she\n",
      "found her heart lifting painfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo!” he yelled, like a savage, yet he did not in the least resemble\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--Tom!” cried Bo, falteringly. She half held out her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You, girl?” That seemed to be his piercing query, like the quivering\n",
      "blade in his eyes. Two more long strides carried him close up to her,\n",
      "and his look chased the red out of Bo's cheek. Then it was beautiful to\n",
      "see his face marvelously change until it was that of the well remembered\n",
      "Las Vegas magnified in all his old spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” The exclamation was a tremendous sigh. “I shore am glad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "That beautiful flash left his face as he wheeled to the men. He wrung\n",
      "Dale's hand long and hard, and his gaze confused the older man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“RIGGS!” he said, and in the jerk of his frame as he whipped out the\n",
      "word disappeared the strange, fleeting signs of his kindlier emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson killed him,” replied Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim Wilson--that old Texas Ranger!... Reckon he lent you a hand?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, he saved Bo,” replied Dale, with emotion. “My old cougar an'\n",
      "me--we just hung 'round.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You made Wilson help you?” cut in the hard voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. But he killed Riggs before I come up an' I reckon he'd done well\n",
      "by Bo if I'd never got there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How about the gang?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All snuffed out, I reckon, except Wilson.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somebody told me Beasley hed ran Miss Helen off the ranch. Thet so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Four of his greasers packed her down the hill--most tore her\n",
      "clothes off, so Roy tells me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Four greasers!... Shore it was Beasley's deal clean through?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Riggs was led. He had an itch for a bad name, you know. But\n",
      "Beasley made the plan. It was Nell they wanted instead of Bo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Abruptly Carmichael stalked off down the darkening path, his silver\n",
      "heel-plates ringing, his spurs jingling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, Carmichael,” called Dale, taking a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Tom!” cried Bo.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore folks callin' won't be no use, if anythin would be,” said Roy.\n",
      "“Las Vegas has hed a look at red liquor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's been drinking! Oh, that accounts!... he never--never even touched\n",
      "me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "For once Helen was not ready to comfort Bo. A mighty tug at her heart\n",
      "had sent her with flying, uneven steps toward Dale. He took another\n",
      "stride down the path, and another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale--oh--please stop!” she called, very low.\n",
      "\n",
      "He halted as if he had run sharply into a bar across the path. When he\n",
      "turned Helen had come close. Twilight was deep there in the shade of the\n",
      "peach-trees, but she could see his face, the hungry, flaring eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I haven't thanked you--yet--for bringing Bo home,” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, never mind that,” he said, in surprise. “If you must--why, wait.\n",
      "I've got to catch up with that cowboy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Let me thank you now,” she whispered, and, stepping closer, she put\n",
      "her arms up, meaning to put them round his neck. That action must be her\n",
      "self-punishment for the other time she had done it. Yet it might also\n",
      "serve to thank him. But, strangely, her hands got no farther than his\n",
      "breast, and fluttered there to catch hold of the fringe of his buckskin\n",
      "jacket. She felt a heave of his deep chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I do thank you--with all my heart,” she said, softly. “I owe you\n",
      "now--for myself and her--more than I can ever repay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I'm your friend,” he replied, hurriedly. “Don't talk of repayin'\n",
      "me. Let me go now--after Las Vegas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” she queried, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean to line up beside him--at the bar--or wherever he goes,”\n",
      " returned Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't tell me that. _I_ know. You're going straight to meet Beasley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, if you hold me up any longer I reckon I'll have to run--or never\n",
      "get to Beasley before that cowboy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen locked her fingers in the fringe of his jacket--leaned closer to\n",
      "him, all her being responsive to a bursting gust of blood over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll not let you go,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He laughed, and put his great hands over hers. “What 're you sayin',\n",
      "girl? You can't stop me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I can. Dale, I don't want you to risk your life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared at her, and made as if to tear her hands from their hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen--please--oh--please!” she implored. “If you go deliberately\n",
      "to kill Beasley--and do it--that will be murder.... It's against my\n",
      "religion.... I would be unhappy all my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, child, you'll be ruined all your life if Beasley is not dealt\n",
      "with--as men of his breed are always dealt with in the West,” he\n",
      "remonstrated, and in one quick move he had freed himself from her\n",
      "clutching fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen, with a move as swift, put her arms round his neck and clasped her\n",
      "hands tight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, I'm finding myself,” she said. “The other day, when I\n",
      "did--this--you made an excuse for me.... I'm not two-faced now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She meant to keep him from killing Beasley if she sacrificed every last\n",
      "shred of her pride. And she stamped the look of his face on her heart\n",
      "of hearts to treasure always. The thrill, the beat of her pulses, almost\n",
      "obstructed her thought of purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, just now--when you're overcome--rash with feelin's--don't say to\n",
      "me--a word--a--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke down huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My first friend--my--Oh Dale, I KNOW you love me! she whispered. And\n",
      "she hid her face on his breast, there to feel a tremendous tumult.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don't you?” she cried, in low, smothered voice, as his silence\n",
      "drove her farther on this mad, yet glorious purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you need to be told--yes--I reckon I do love you, Nell Rayner,” he\n",
      "replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed to Helen that he spoke from far off. She lifted her face, her\n",
      "heart on her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you kill Beasley I'll never marry you,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's expectin' you to?” he asked, with low, hoarse laugh. “Do you\n",
      "think you have to marry me to square accounts? This's the only time you\n",
      "ever hurt me, Nell Rayner.... I'm 'shamed you could think I'd expect\n",
      "you--out of gratitude--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--you--you are as dense as the forest where you live,” she cried.\n",
      "And then she shut her eyes again, the better to remember that\n",
      "transfiguration of his face, the better to betray herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man--I love you!” Full and deep, yet tremulous, the words burst from\n",
      "her heart that had been burdened with them for many a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it seemed, in the throbbing riot of her senses, that she was\n",
      "lifted and swung into his arms, and handled with a great and terrible\n",
      "tenderness, and hugged and kissed with the hunger and awkwardness of a\n",
      "bear, and held with her feet off the ground, and rendered blind, dizzy,\n",
      "rapturous, and frightened, and utterly torn asunder from her old calm,\n",
      "thinking self.\n",
      "\n",
      "He put her down--released her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothin' could have made me so happy as what you said.” He finished with\n",
      "a strong sigh of unutterable, wondering joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you will not go to--to meet--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's happy query froze on her lips.\n",

      "woods.”\n",

      "Helen heard his soft, padded footfalls swiftly pass away. She was left\n",
      "there, alone in the darkening twilight, suddenly cold and stricken, as\n",
      "if turned to stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus she stood an age-long moment until the upflashing truth galvanized\n",
      "her into action. Then she flew in pursuit of Dale. The truth was that,\n",
      "in spite of Dale's' early training in the East and the long years of\n",
      "solitude which had made him wonderful in thought and feeling, he had\n",
      "also become a part of this raw, bold, and violent West.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite dark now and she had run quite some distance before she saw\n",
      "Dale's tall, dark form against the yellow light of Turner's saloon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow, in that poignant moment, when her flying feet kept pace with\n",
      "her heart, Helen felt in herself a force opposing itself against this\n",
      "raw, primitive justice of the West. She was one of the first influences\n",
      "emanating from civilized life, from law and order. In that flash of\n",
      "truth she saw the West as it would be some future time, when through\n",
      "women and children these wild frontier days would be gone forever. Also,\n",
      "just as clearly she saw the present need of men like Roy Beeman and Dale\n",
      "and the fire-blooded Carmichael. Beasley and his kind must be killed.\n",
      "But Helen did not want her lover, her future husband, and the probable\n",
      "father of her children to commit what she held to be murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the door of the saloon she caught up with Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt--oh--wait!'--wait!” she panted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard him curse under his breath as he turned. They were alone in\n",
      "the yellow flare of light. Horses were champing bits and drooping before\n",
      "the rails.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You go back!” ordered Dale, sternly. His face was pale, his eyes were\n",
      "gleaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! Not till--you take me--or carry me!” she replied, resolutely, with\n",
      "all a woman's positive and inevitable assurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he laid hold of her with ungentle hands. His violence, especially\n",
      "the look on his face, terrified Helen, rendered her weak. But nothing\n",
      "could have shaken her resolve. She felt victory. Her sex, her love, and\n",
      "her presence would be too much for Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he swung Helen around, the low hum of voices inside the saloon\n",
      "suddenly rose to sharp, hoarse roars, accompanied by a scuffling of feet\n",
      "and crashing of violently sliding chairs or tables. Dale let go of Helen\n",
      "and leaped toward the door. But a silence inside, quicker and stranger\n",
      "than the roar, halted him. Helen's heart contracted, then seemed to\n",
      "cease beating. There was absolutely not a perceptible sound. Even the\n",
      "horses appeared, like Dale, to have turned to statues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two thundering shots annihilated this silence. Then quickly came a\n",
      "lighter shot--the smash of glass. Dale ran into the saloon. The horses\n",
      "began to snort, to rear, to pound. A low, muffled murmur terrified Helen\n",
      "even as it drew her. Dashing at the door, she swung it in and entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place was dim, blue-hazed, smelling of smoke. Dale stood just inside\n",
      "the door. On the floor lay two men. Chairs and tables were overturned.\n",
      "A motley, dark, shirt-sleeved, booted, and belted crowd of men appeared\n",
      "hunched against the opposite wall, with pale, set faces, turned to the\n",
      "bar. Turner, the proprietor, stood at one end, his face livid, his hands\n",
      "aloft and shaking. Carmichael leaned against the middle of the bar. He\n",
      "held a gun low down. It was smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a gasp Helen flashed her eyes back to Dale. He had seen her--was\n",
      "reaching an arm toward her. Then she saw the man lying almost at her\n",
      "feet. Jeff Mulvey--her uncle's old foreman! His face was awful to\n",
      "behold. A smoking gun lay near his inert hand. The other man had fallen\n",
      "on his face. His garb proclaimed him a Mexican. He was not yet dead.\n",
      "Then Helen, as she felt Dale's arm encircle her, looked farther, because\n",
      "she could not prevent it--looked on at that strange figure against the\n",
      "bar--this boy who had been such a friend in her hour of need--this naive\n",
      "and frank sweetheart of her sister's.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw a man now--wild, white, intense as fire, with some terrible cool\n",
      "kind of deadliness in his mien. His left elbow rested upon the bar, and\n",
      "his hand held a glass of red liquor. The big gun, low down in his other\n",
      "hand, seemed as steady as if it were a fixture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heah's to thet--half-breed Beasley an' his outfit!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmichael drank, while his flaming eyes held the crowd; then with\n",
      "savage action of terrible passion he flung the glass at the quivering\n",
      "form of the still living Mexican on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt herself slipping. All seemed to darken around her. She could\n",
      "not see Dale, though she knew he held her. Then she fainted.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXV\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas Carmichael was a product of his day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pan Handle of Texas, the old Chisholm Trail along which were\n",
      "driven the great cattle herds northward, Fort Dodge, where the cowboys\n",
      "conflicted with the card-sharps--these hard places had left their marks\n",
      "on Carmichael. To come from Texas was to come from fighting stock. And\n",
      "a cowboy's life was strenuous, wild, violent, and generally brief. The\n",
      "exceptions were the fortunate and the swiftest men with guns; and they\n",
      "drifted from south to north and west, taking with them the reckless,\n",
      "chivalrous, vitriolic spirit peculiar to their breed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pioneers and ranchers of the frontier would never have made the West\n",
      "habitable had it not been for these wild cowboys, these hard-drinking,\n",
      "hard-riding, hard-living rangers of the barrens, these easy, cool,\n",
      "laconic, simple young men whose blood was tinged with fire and who\n",
      "possessed a magnificent and terrible effrontery toward danger and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas ran his horse from Widow Cass's cottage to Turner's saloon,\n",
      "and the hoofs of the goaded steed crashed in the door. Las Vegas's\n",
      "entrance was a leap. Then he stood still with the door ajar and the\n",
      "horse pounding and snorting back. All the men in that saloon who saw the\n",
      "entrance of Las Vegas knew what it portended. No thunderbolt could\n",
      "have more quickly checked the drinking, gambling, talking crowd. They\n",
      "recognized with kindred senses the nature of the man and his arrival.\n",
      "For a second the blue-hazed room was perfectly quiet, then men breathed,\n",
      "moved, rose, and suddenly caused a quick, sliding crash of chairs and\n",
      "tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy's glittering eyes flashed to and fro, and then fixed on\n",
      "Mulvey and his Mexican companion. That glance singled out these two, and\n",
      "the sudden rush of nervous men proved it. Mulvey and the sheep-herder\n",
      "were left alone in the center of the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Jeff! Where's your boss?” asked Las Vegas. His voice was cool,\n",
      "friendly; his manner was easy, natural; but the look of him was what\n",
      "made Mulvey pale and the Mexican livid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon he's home,” replied Mulvey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Home? What's he call home now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He's hangin' out hyar at Auchincloss's,” replied Mulvey. His voice was\n",
      "not strong, but his eyes were steady, watchful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas quivered all over as if stung. A flame that seemed white and\n",
      "red gave his face a singular hue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jeff, you worked for old Al a long time, an' I've heard of your\n",
      "differences,” said Las Vegas. “Thet ain't no mix of mine.... But you\n",
      "double-crossed Miss Helen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mulvey made no attempt to deny this. He gulped slowly. His hands\n",
      "appeared less steady, and he grew paler. Again Las Vegas's words\n",
      "signified less than his look. And that look now included the Mexican.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pedro, you're one of Beasley's old hands,” said Las Vegas, accusingly.\n",
      "“An'--you was one of them four greasers thet--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the cowboy choked and bit over his words as if they were a material\n",
      "poison. The Mexican showed his guilt and cowardice. He began to jabber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shet up!” hissed Las Vegas, with a savage and significant jerk of\n",
      "his arm, as if about to strike. But that action was read for its true\n",
      "meaning. Pell-mell the crowd split to rush each way and leave an open\n",
      "space behind the three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas waited. But Mulvey seemed obstructed. The Mexican looked\n",
      "dangerous through his fear. His fingers twitched as if the tendons\n",
      "running up into his arms were being pulled.\n",
      "\n",
      "An instant of suspense--more than long enough for Mulvey to be tried and\n",
      "found wanting--and Las Vegas, with laugh and sneer, turned his back upon\n",
      "the pair and stepped to the bar. His call for a bottle made Turner jump\n",
      "and hold it out with shaking hands. Las Vegas poured out a drink, while\n",
      "his gaze was intent on the scarred old mirror hanging behind the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This turning his back upon men he had just dared to draw showed what\n",
      "kind of a school Las Vegas had been trained in. If those men had been\n",
      "worthy antagonists of his class he would never have scorned them. As it\n",
      "was, when Mulvey and the Mexican jerked at their guns, Las Vegas swiftly\n",
      "wheeled and shot twice. Mulvey's gun went off as he fell, and the\n",
      "Mexican doubled up in a heap on the floor. Then Las Vegas reached around\n",
      "with his left hand for the drink he had poured out.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture Dale burst into the saloon, suddenly to check his\n",
      "impetus, to swerve aside toward the bar and halt. The door had not\n",
      "ceased swinging when again it was propelled inward, this time to admit\n",
      "Helen Rayner, white and wide-eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment then Las Vegas had spoken his deadly toast to\n",
      "Beasley's gang and had fiercely flung the glass at the writhing Mexican\n",
      "on the floor. Also Dale had gravitated toward the reeling Helen to catch\n",
      "her when she fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas began to curse, and, striding to Dale, he pushed him out of\n",
      "the saloon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“--! What 're you doin' heah?” he yelled, stridently. “Hevn't you got\n",
      "thet girl to think of? Then do it, you big Indian! Lettin' her run after\n",
      "you heah--riskin' herself thet way! You take care of her an' Bo an'\n",
      "leave this deal to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy, furious as he was at Dale, yet had keen, swift eyes for the\n",
      "horses near at hand, and the men out in the dim light. Dale lifted\n",
      "the girl into his arms, and, turning without a word, stalked away to\n",
      "disappear in the darkness. Las Vegas, holding his gun low, returned to\n",
      "the bar-room. If there had been any change in the crowd it was slight.\n",
      "The tension had relaxed. Turner no longer stood with hands up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You-all go on with your fun,” called the cowboy, with a sweep of his\n",
      "gun. “But it'd be risky fer any one to start leavin'.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he backed against the bar, near where the black bottle stood.\n",
      "Turner walked out to begin righting tables and chairs, and presently the\n",
      "crowd, with some caution and suspense, resumed their games and drinking.\n",
      "It was significant that a wide berth lay between them and the door. From\n",
      "time to time Turner served liquor to men who called for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas leaned with back against the bar. After a while he sheathed\n",
      "his gun and reached around for the bottle. He drank with his piercing\n",
      "eyes upon the door. No one entered and no one went out. The games\n",
      "of chance there and the drinking were not enjoyed. It was a hard\n",
      "scene--that smoky, long, ill-smelling room, with its dim, yellow lights,\n",
      "and dark, evil faces, with the stealthy-stepping Turner passing to and\n",
      "fro, and the dead Mulvey staring in horrible fixidity at the ceiling,\n",
      "and the Mexican quivering more and more until he shook violently, then\n",
      "lay still, and with the drinking, somber, waiting cowboy, more fiery and\n",
      "more flaming with every drink, listening for a step that did not come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time passed, and what little change it wrought was in the cowboy. Drink\n",
      "affected him, but he did not become drunk. It seemed that the liquor he\n",
      "drank was consumed by a mounting fire. It was fuel to a driving passion.\n",
      "He grew more sullen, somber, brooding, redder of eye and face, more\n",
      "crouching and restless. At last, when the hour was so late that there\n",
      "was no probability of Beasley appearing, Las Vegas flung himself out of\n",
      "the saloon.\n",
      "\n",
      "All lights of the village had now been extinguished. The tired horses\n",
      "drooped in the darkness. Las Vegas found his horse and led him away down\n",
      "the road and out a lane to a field where a barn stood dim and dark in\n",
      "the starlight. Morning was not far off. He unsaddled the horse and,\n",
      "turning him loose, went into the barn. Here he seemed familiar with\n",
      "his surroundings, for he found a ladder and climbed to a loft, where he\n",
      "threw himself on the hay.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rested, but did not sleep. At daylight he went down and brought his\n",
      "horse into the barn. Sunrise found Las Vegas pacing to and fro the short\n",
      "length of the interior, and peering out through wide cracks between\n",
      "the boards. Then during the succeeding couple of hours he watched\n",
      "the occasional horseman and wagon and herder that passed on into the\n",
      "village.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the breakfast hour Las Vegas saddled his horse and rode back the\n",
      "way he had come the night before. At Turner's he called for something\n",
      "to eat as well as for whisky. After that he became a listening, watching\n",
      "machine. He drank freely for an hour; then he stopped. He seemed to\n",
      "be drunk, but with a different kind of drunkenness from that usual in\n",
      "drinking men. Savage, fierce, sullen, he was one to avoid. Turner waited\n",
      "on him in evident fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Las Vegas's condition became such that action was involuntary.\n",
      "He could not stand still nor sit down. Stalking out, he passed the\n",
      "store, where men slouched back to avoid him, and he went down the road,\n",
      "wary and alert, as if he expected a rifle-shot from some hidden enemy.\n",
      "Upon his return down that main thoroughfare of the village not a person\n",
      "was to be seen. He went in to Turner's. The proprietor was there at his\n",
      "post, nervous and pale. Las Vegas did not order any more liquor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turner, I reckon I'll bore you next time I run in heah,” he said, and\n",
      "stalked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had the stores, the road, the village, to himself; and he patrolled a\n",
      "beat like a sentry watching for an Indian attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Toward noon a single man ventured out into the road to accost the\n",
      "cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I'm tellin' you--all the greasers air leavin' the range,” he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Abe!” replied Las Vegas. “What 'n hell you talkin' about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man repeated his information. And Las Vegas spat out frightful\n",
      "curses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Abe--you heah what Beasley's doin'?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. He's with his men--up at the ranch. Reckon he can't put off ridin'\n",
      "down much longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was where the West spoke. Beasley would be forced to meet the enemy\n",
      "who had come out single-handed against him. Long before this hour a\n",
      "braver man would have come to face Las Vegas. Beasley could not hire\n",
      "any gang to bear the brunt of this situation. This was the test by which\n",
      "even his own men must judge him. All of which was to say that as the\n",
      "wildness of the West had made possible his crimes, so it now held him\n",
      "responsible for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Abe, if thet--greaser don't rustle down heah I'm goin' after him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. But don't be in no hurry,” replied Abe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'm waltzin' to slow music.... Gimme a smoke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With fingers that slightly trembled Abe rolled a cigarette, lit it from\n",
      "his own, and handed it to the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I reckon I hear hosses,” he said, suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me, too,” replied Las Vegas, with his head high like that of a\n",
      "listening deer. Apparently he forgot the cigarette and also his friend.\n",
      "Abe hurried back to the store, where he disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas began his stalking up and down, and his action now was an\n",
      "exaggeration of all his former movements. A rational, ordinary mortal\n",
      "from some Eastern community, happening to meet this red-faced cowboy,\n",
      "would have considered him drunk or crazy. Probably Las Vegas looked\n",
      "both. But all the same he was a marvelously keen and strung and\n",
      "efficient instrument to meet the portending issue. How many thousands of\n",
      "times, on the trails, and in the wide-streeted little towns all over the\n",
      "West, had this stalk of the cowboy's been perpetrated! Violent, bloody,\n",
      "tragic as it was, it had an importance in that pioneer day equal to the\n",
      "use of a horse or the need of a plow.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Pine was apparently a deserted village, except for Las Vegas,\n",
      "who patrolled his long beat in many ways--he lounged while he\n",
      "watched; he stalked like a mountaineer; he stole along Indian fashion,\n",
      "stealthily, from tree to tree, from corner to corner; he disappeared in\n",
      "the saloon to reappear at the back; he slipped round behind the barns to\n",
      "come out again in the main road; and time after time he approached his\n",
      "horse as if deciding to mount.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last visit he made into Turner's saloon he found no one there.\n",
      "Savagely he pounded on the bar with his gun. He got no response. Then\n",
      "the long-pent-up rage burst. With wild whoops he pulled another gun and\n",
      "shot at the mirror, the lamps. He shot the neck off a bottle and drank\n",
      "till he choked, his neck corded, bulging, and purple. His only slow and\n",
      "deliberate action was the reloading of his gun. Then he crashed through\n",
      "the doors, and with a wild yell leaped sheer into the saddle, hauling\n",
      "his horse up high and goading him to plunge away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men running to the door and windows of the store saw a streak of dust\n",
      "flying down the road. And then they trooped out to see it disappear. The\n",
      "hour of suspense ended for them. Las Vegas had lived up to the code of\n",
      "the West, had dared his man out, had waited far longer than needful to\n",
      "prove that man a coward. Whatever the issue now, Beasley was branded\n",
      "forever. That moment saw the decline of whatever power he had wielded.\n",
      "He and his men might kill the cowboy who had ridden out alone to face\n",
      "him, but that would not change the brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preceding night Beasley bad been finishing a late supper at his\n",
      "newly acquired ranch, when Buck Weaver, one of his men, burst in upon\n",
      "him with news of the death of Mulvey and Pedro.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who's in the outfit? How many?” he had questioned, quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's a one-man outfit, boss,” replied Weaver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley appeared astounded. He and his men had prepared to meet the\n",
      "friends of the girl whose property he had taken over, and because of the\n",
      "superiority of his own force he had anticipated no bloody or extended\n",
      "feud. This amazing circumstance put the case in very much more difficult\n",
      "form.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One man!” he ejaculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yep. Thet cowboy Las Vegas. An', boss, he turns out to be a gun-slinger\n",
      "from Texas. I was in Turner's. Hed jest happened to step in the other\n",
      "room when Las Vegas come bustin' in on his hoss an' jumped off.... Fust\n",
      "thing he called Jeff an' Pedro. They both showed yaller. An' then, damn\n",

      "their guns why he whirled quick as lightnin' an' bored them both.... I\n",
      "sneaked out an--”\n",

      "liquor. Besides, I 'ain't got nothin' ag'in' Las Vegas. If he's rustled\n",
      "over here at the head of a crowd to put us off I'd fight, jest as we'd\n",
      "all fight. But you see we figgered wrong. It's between you an' Las\n",
      "Vegas!... You oughter seen him throw thet hunter Dale out of Turner's.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dale! Did he come?” queried Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He got there just after the cowboy plugged Jeff. An' thet big-eyed\n",
      "girl, she came runnin' in, too. An' she keeled over in Dale's arms. Las\n",

      "\n",
      "Beasley thus heard the West speak out of the mouth of his own man. And\n",
      "grim, sardonic, almost scornful, indeed, were the words of Buck Weaver.\n",
      "This rider had once worked for Al Auchincloss and had deserted to\n",
      "Beasley under Mulvey's leadership. Mulvey was dead and the situation was\n",
      "vastly changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley gave Weaver a dark, lowering glance, and waved him away. From\n",
      "the door Weaver sent back a doubtful, scrutinizing gaze, then slouched\n",
      "out. That gaze Beasley had not encountered before.\n",
      "\n",
      "It meant, as Weaver's cronies meant, as Beasley's long-faithful riders,\n",
      "and the people of the range, and as the spirit of the West meant, that\n",
      "Beasley was expected to march down into the village to face his single\n",
      "foe.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Beasley did not go. Instead he paced to and fro the length of Helen\n",
      "Rayner's long sitting-room with the nervous energy of a man who\n",
      "could not rest. Many times he hesitated, and at others he made sudden\n",
      "movements toward the door, only to halt. Long after midnight he went\n",
      "to bed, but not to sleep. He tossed and rolled all night, and at dawn\n",
      "arose, gloomy and irritable.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cursed the Mexican serving-women who showed their displeasure at\n",
      "his authority. And to his amaze and rage not one of his men came to\n",
      "the house. He waited and waited. Then he stalked off to the corrals and\n",
      "stables carrying a rifle with him. The men were there, in a group that\n",
      "dispersed somewhat at his advent. Not a Mexican was in sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley ordered the horses to be saddled and all hands to go down into\n",
      "the village with him. That order was disobeyed. Beasley stormed and\n",
      "raged. His riders sat or lounged, with lowered faces. An unspoken\n",
      "hostility seemed present. Those who had been longest with him were least\n",
      "distant and strange, but still they did not obey. At length Beasley\n",
      "roared for his Mexicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, we gotta tell you thet every greaser on the ranch hes\n",

      "Weaver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all these sudden-uprising perplexities this latest was the most\n",
      "astounding. Beasley cursed with his questioning wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boss, they was sure scared of thet gun-slingin' cowboy from Texas,”\n",
      " replied Weaver, imperturbably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley's dark, swarthy face changed its hue. What of the subtle\n",
      "reflection in Weaver's slow speech! One of the men came out of a corral\n",
      "leading Beasley's saddled and bridled horse. This fellow dropped the\n",
      "bridle and sat down among his comrades without a word. No one spoke. The\n",
      "presence of the horse was significant. With a snarling, muttered curse,\n",
      "Beasley took up his rifle and strode back to the ranch-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his rage and passion he did not realize what his men had known for\n",
      "hours--that if he had stood any chance at all for their respect as well\n",
      "as for his life the hour was long past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley avoided the open paths to the house, and when he got there he\n",
      "nervously poured out a drink. Evidently something in the fiery liquor\n",
      "frightened him, for he threw the bottle aside. It was as if that bottle\n",
      "contained a courage which was false.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he paced the long sitting-room, growing more and more wrought-up\n",
      "as evidently he grew familiar with the singular state of affairs. Twice\n",
      "the pale serving-woman called him to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dining-room was light and pleasant, and the meal, fragrant and\n",
      "steaming, was ready for him. But the women had disappeared. Beasley\n",
      "seated himself--spread out his big hands on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a slight rustle--a clink of spur--startled him. He twisted his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Howdy, Beasley!” said Las Vegas, who had appeared as if by magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley's frame seemed to swell as if a flood had been loosed in his\n",
      "veins. Sweat-drops stood out on his pallid face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What--you--want?” he asked, huskily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal now, my boss, Miss Helen, says, seein' I am foreman heah, thet it'd\n",
      "be nice an' proper fer me to drop in an' eat with you--THE LAST TIME!”\n",
      " replied the cowboy. His drawl was slow and cool, his tone was friendly\n",
      "and pleasant. But his look was that of a falcon ready to drive deep its\n",
      "beak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beasley's reply was loud, incoherent, hoarse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas seated himself across from Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eat or not, it's shore all the same to me,” said Las Vegas, and he\n",
      "began to load his plate with his left hand. His right hand rested very\n",
      "lightly, with just the tips of his vibrating fingers on the edge of\n",
      "the table; and he never for the slightest fraction of a second took his\n",
      "piercing eyes off Beasley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, my half-breed greaser guest, it shore roils up my blood to see you\n",
      "sittin' there--thinkin' you've put my boss, Miss Helen, off this ranch,”\n",
      " began Las Vegas, softly. And then he helped himself leisurely to food\n",
      "and drink. “In my day I've shore stacked up against a lot of outlaws,\n",
      "thieves, rustlers, an' sich like, but fer an out an' out dirty low-down\n",
      "skunk, you shore take the dough!... I'm goin, to kill you in a minit or\n",

      "if you don't.... Of all the--yaller greaser dogs I ever seen, you're the\n",
      "worst!... I was thinkin' last night mebbe you'd come down an' meet me\n",
      "like a man, so 's I could wash my hands ever afterward without gettin'\n",
      "sick to my stummick. But you didn't come.... Beasley, I'm so ashamed of\n",
      "myself thet I gotta call you--when I ought to bore you, thet--I ain't\n",
      "even second cousin to my old self when I rode fer Chisholm. It don't\n",

      "Gawd!--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carmichael, gimme a word in,” hoarsely broke out Beasley. “You're\n",
      "right, it won't do no good to call me.... But let's talk.... I'll buy\n",
      "you off. Ten thousand dollars--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haw! Haw! Haw!” roared Las Vegas. He was as tense as a strung cord and\n",
      "his face possessed a singular pale radiance. His right hand began to\n",
      "quiver more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll--double--it!” panted Beasley. “I'll--make over--half the\n",
      "ranch--all the stock--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swaller thet!” yelled Las Vegas, with terrible strident ferocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen--man!... I take--it back!... I'll give up--Auchincloss's ranch!”\n",
      " Beasley was now a shaking, whispering, frenzied man, ghastly white, with\n",
      "rolling eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas's left fist pounded hard on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“GREASER, COME ON!” he thundered.\n",

      "Then Beasley, with desperate, frantic action, jerked for his gun.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXVI\n",
      "\n",
      "For Helen Rayner that brief, dark period of expulsion from her home had\n",
      "become a thing of the past, almost forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two months had flown by on the wings of love and work and the joy of\n",
      "finding her place there in the West. All her old men had been only too\n",
      "glad of the opportunity to come back to her, and under Dale and Roy\n",
      "Beeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of\n",
      "rooms and adding a new section. Only once had she ventured into the old\n",
      "dining-room where Las Vegas Carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner\n",
      "for Beasley. She made a store-room of it, and a place she would never\n",
      "again enter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen was happy, almost too happy, she thought, and therefore made\n",
      "more than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of\n",
      "life. Carmichael had ridden out of Pine, ostensibly on the trail of the\n",
      "Mexicans who had executed Beasley's commands. The last seen of him\n",
      "had been reported from Show Down, where he had appeared red-eyed and\n",
      "dangerous, like a hound on a scent. Then two months had flown by without\n",
      "a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboy's\n",
      "absence. It would be just like Las Vegas never to be heard of again.\n",
      "Also it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his\n",
      "drunken, savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by\n",
      "his friends. Bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than\n",
      "Helen. But Bo grew more restless, wilder, and more wilful than ever.\n",
      "Helen thought she guessed Bo's secret; and once she ventured a hint\n",
      "concerning Carmichael's return.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Tom doesn't come back pretty soon I'll marry Milt Dale,” retorted\n",
      "Bo, tauntingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This fired Helen's cheeks with red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, child,” she protested, half angry, half grave. “Milt and I are\n",
      "engaged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure. Only you're so slow. There's many a slip--you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I tell you Tom will come back,” replied Helen, earnestly. “I feel\n",
      "it. There was something fine in that cowboy. He understood me better\n",
      "than you or Milt, either.... And he was perfectly wild in love with\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! WAS he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much more than you deserved, Bo Rayner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then occurred one of Bo's sweet, bewildering, unexpected\n",
      "transformations. Her defiance, resentment, rebelliousness, vanished from\n",
      "a softly agitated face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Nell, I know that.... You just watch me if I ever get another\n",
      "chance at him!... Then--maybe he'd never drink again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, be happy--and be good. Don't ride off any more--don't tease the\n",
      "boys. It'll all come right in the end.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo recovered her equanimity quickly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! You can afford to be cheerful. You've got a man who can't live\n",
      "when you're out of his sight. He's like a fish on dry land.... And\n",
      "you--why, once you were an old pessimist!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo was not to be consoled or changed. Helen could only sigh and pray\n",
      "that her convictions would be verified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first day of July brought an early thunder-storm, just at sunrise.\n",
      "It roared and flared and rolled away, leaving a gorgeous golden cloud\n",
      "pageant in the sky and a fresh, sweetly smelling, glistening green range\n",
      "that delighted Helen's eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Birds were twittering in the arbors and bees were humming in the\n",
      "flowers. From the fields down along the brook came a blended song of\n",
      "swamp-blackbird and meadow-lark. A clarion-voiced burro split the air\n",
      "with his coarse and homely bray. The sheep were bleating, and a soft baa\n",
      "of little lambs came sweetly to Helen's ears. She went her usual rounds\n",
      "with more than usual zest and thrill. Everywhere was color, activity,\n",
      "life. The wind swept warm and pine-scented down from the mountain\n",
      "heights, now black and bold, and the great green slopes seemed to call\n",
      "to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment she came suddenly upon Dale, in his shirt-sleeves,\n",
      "dusty and hot, standing motionless, gazing at the distant mountains.\n",
      "Helen's greeting startled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I was just looking away yonder,” he said, smiling. She thrilled at\n",
      "the clear, wonderful light of his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So was I--a moment ago,” she replied, wistfully. “Do you miss the\n",
      "forest--very much?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, I miss nothing. But I'd like to ride with you under the pines\n",
      "once more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We'll go,” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When?” he asked, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--soon!” And then with flushed face and downcast eyes she passed on.\n",
      "For long Helen had cherished a fond hope that she might be married in\n",
      "Paradise Park, where she had fallen in love with Dale and had realized\n",
      "herself. But she had kept that hope secret. Dale's eager tone, his\n",
      "flashing eyes, had made her feel that her secret was there in her\n",
      "telltale face.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she entered the lane leading to the house she encountered one of the\n",
      "new stable-boys driving a pack-mule.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jim, whose pack is that?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ma'am, I dunno, but I heard him tell Roy he reckoned his name was mud,”\n",
      " replied the boy, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen's heart gave a quick throb. That sounded like Las Vegas. She\n",
      "hurried on, and upon entering the courtyard she espied Roy Beeman\n",
      "holding the halter of a beautiful, wild-looking mustang. There was\n",
      "another horse with another man, who was in the act of dismounting on the\n",
      "far side. When he stepped into better view Helen recognized Las Vegas.\n",
      "And he saw her at the same instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen did not look up again until she was near the porch. She had\n",
      "dreaded this meeting, yet she was so glad that she could have cried\n",
      "aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Helen, I shore am glad to see you,” he said, standing bareheaded\n",
      "before her, the same young, frank-faced cowboy she had seen first from\n",
      "the train.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom!” she exclaimed, and offered her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrung them hard while he looked at her. The swift woman's glance\n",
      "Helen gave in return seemed to drive something dark and doubtful out of\n",
      "her heart. This was the same boy she had known--whom she had liked so\n",
      "well--who had won her sister's love. Helen imagined facing him thus was\n",
      "like awakening from a vague nightmare of doubt. Carmichael's face was\n",
      "clean, fresh, young, with its healthy tan; it wore the old glad smile,\n",
      "cool, easy, and natural; his eyes were like Dale's--penetrating, clear\n",
      "as crystal, without a shadow. What had evil, drink, blood, to do\n",
      "with the real inherent nobility of this splendid specimen of Western\n",
      "hardihood? Wherever he had been, whatever he had done during that\n",
      "long absence, he had returned long separated from that wild and savage\n",
      "character she could now forget. Perhaps there would never again be call\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How's my girl?” he asked, just as naturally as if he had been gone a\n",
      "few days on some errand of his employer's.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo? Oh, she's well--fine. I--I rather think she'll be glad to see you,”\n",
      " replied Helen, warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An' how's thet big Indian, Dale?” he drawled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, too--I'm sure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I got back heah in time to see you-all married?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I--I assure you I--no one around here has been married yet,” replied\n",
      "Helen, with a blush.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thet shore is fine. Was some worried,” he said, lazily. “I've been\n",
      "chasin' wild hosses over in New Mexico, an' I got after this heah blue\n",
      "roan. He kept me chasin' him fer a spell. I've fetched him back for Bo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen looked at the mustang Roy was holding, to be instantly delighted.\n",
      "He was a roan almost blue in color, neither large nor heavy, but\n",
      "powerfully built, clean-limbed, and racy, with a long mane and tail,\n",
      "black as coal, and a beautiful head that made Helen love him at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I'm jealous,” declared Helen, archly. “I never did see such a\n",
      "pony.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckoned you'd never ride any hoss but Ranger,” said Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I never will. But I can be jealous, anyhow, can't I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore. An I reckon if you say you're goin' to have him--wal, Bo 'd be\n",
      "funny,” he drawled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon she would be funny,” retorted Helen. She was so happy that\n",
      "she imitated his speech. She wanted to hug him. It was too good to be\n",
      "true--the return of this cowboy. He understood her. He had come back\n",
      "with nothing that could alienate her. He had apparently forgotten the\n",
      "terrible role he had accepted and the doom he had meted out to her\n",
      "enemies. That moment was wonderful for Helen in its revelation of the\n",
      "strange significance of the West as embodied in this cowboy. He was\n",
      "great. But he did not know that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the door of the living-room opened, and a sweet, high voice pealed\n",
      "out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy! Oh, what a mustang! Whose is he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, Bo, if all I hear is so he belongs to you,” replied Roy with a\n",
      "huge grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo appeared in the door. She stepped out upon the porch. She saw the\n",
      "cowboy. The excited flash of her pretty face vanished as she paled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, I shore am glad to see you,” drawled Las Vegas, as he stepped\n",
      "forward, sombrero in hand. Helen could not see any sign of confusion in\n",
      "him. But, indeed, she saw gladness. Then she expected to behold Bo run\n",
      "right into the cowboys's arms. It appeared, however, that she was doomed\n",
      "to disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, I'm glad to see you,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "They shook hands as old friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You're lookin' right fine,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I'm well.... And how have you been these six months?” she queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I though it was longer,” he drawled. “Wal, I'm pretty tip-top\n",
      "now, but I was laid up with heart trouble for a spell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heart trouble?” she echoed, dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore.... I ate too much over heah in New Mexico.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's no news to me--where your heart's located,” laughed Bo. Then she\n",
      "ran off the porch to see the blue mustang. She walked round and round\n",
      "him, clasping her hands in sheer delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo, he's a plumb dandy,” said Roy. “Never seen a prettier hoss. He'll\n",
      "run like a streak. An' he's got good eyes. He'll be a pet some day. But\n",
      "I reckon he'll always be spunky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo ventured to step closer, and at last got a hand on the mustang, and\n",
      "then another. She smoothed his quivering neck and called softly to him,\n",
      "until he submitted to her hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What's his name?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blue somethin' or other,” replied Roy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, has my new mustang a name?” asked Bo, turning to the cowboy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, I named him Blue-Bo,” answered Las Vegas, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blue-Boy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nope. He's named after you. An' I chased him, roped him, broke him all\n",
      "myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well. Blue-Bo he is, then.... And he's a wonderful darling horse.\n",
      "Oh, Nell, just look at him.... Tom, I can't thank you enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reckon I don't want any thanks,” drawled the cowboy. “But see heah, Bo,\n",
      "you shore got to live up to conditions before you ride him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” exclaimed Bo, who was startled by his slow, cool, meaning tone,\n",
      "of voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen delighted in looking at Las Vegas then. He had never appeared to\n",
      "better advantage. So cool, careless, and assured! He seemed master of\n",
      "a situation in which his terms must be accepted. Yet he might have been\n",
      "actuated by a cowboy motive beyond the power of Helen to divine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bo Rayner,” drawled Las Vegas, “thet blue mustang will be yours, an'\n",
      "you can ride him--when you're MRS. TOM CARMICHAEL!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had he spoken a softer, more drawling speech, nor gazed at Bo\n",
      "more mildly. Roy seemed thunderstruck. Helen endeavored heroically to\n",
      "restrain her delicious, bursting glee. Bo's wide eyes stared at her\n",
      "lover--darkened--dilated. Suddenly she left the mustang to confront the\n",
      "cowboy where he lounged on the porch steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that?” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shore do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bah! It's only a magnificent bluff,” she retorted. “You're only in fun.\n",
      "It's your--your darned nerve!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Bo,” began Las Vegas, reproachfully. “You shore know I'm not the\n",
      "four-flusher kind. Never got away with a bluff in my life! An' I'm jest\n",
      "in daid earnest aboot this heah.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All the same, signs were not wanting in his mobile face that he was\n",
      "almost unable to restrain his mirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen realized then that Bo saw through the cowboy--that the ultimatum\n",
      "was only one of his tricks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It IS a bluff and I CALL you!” declared Bo, ringingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas suddenly awoke to consequences. He essayed to speak, but she\n",
      "was so wonderful then, so white and blazing-eyed, that he was stricken\n",
      "mute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I'll ride Blue-Bo this afternoon,” deliberately stated the girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas had wit enough to grasp her meaning, and he seemed about to\n",
      "collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well, you can make me Mrs. Tom Carmichael to-day--this\n",
      "morning--just before dinner.... Go get a preacher to marry us--and\n",
      "make yourself look a more presentable bridegroom--UNLESS IT WAS ONLY A\n",
      "BLUFF!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her imperiousness changed as the tremendous portent of her words seemed\n",
      "to make Las Vegas a blank, stone image of a man. With a wild-rose color\n",
      "suffusing her face, she swiftly bent over him, kissed him, and flashed\n",
      "away into the house. Her laugh pealed back, and it thrilled Helen, so\n",
      "deep and strange was it for the wilful sister, so wild and merry and\n",
      "full of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then that Roy Beeman recovered from his paralysis, to let out\n",
      "such a roar of mirth as to frighten the horses. Helen was laughing, and\n",
      "crying, too, but laughing mostly. Las Vegas Carmichael was a sight for\n",
      "the gods to behold. Bo's kiss had unclamped what had bound him. The\n",
      "sudden truth, undeniable, insupportable, glorious, made him a madman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bluff--she called me--ride Blue-Bo saf'ternoon!” he raved,\n",
      "reaching wildly for Helen. “Mrs.--Tom--Carmichael--before\n",
      "dinner--preacher--presentable bridegroom!... Aw! I'm drunk again! I--who\n",
      "swore off forever!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Tom, you're just happy,” said Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between her and Roy the cowboy was at length persuaded to accept the\n",
      "situation and to see his wonderful opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now--now, Miss Helen--what'd Bo mean by pre--presentable bridegroom?...\n",
      "Presents? Lord, I'm clean busted flat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She meant you must dress up in your best, of course,” replied Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where 'n earth will I get a preacher?... Show Down's forty miles....\n",
      "Can't ride there in time.... Roy, I've gotta have a preacher.... Life or\n",
      "death deal fer me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, old man, if you'll brace up I'll marry you to Bo,” said Roy, with\n",
      "his glad grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aw!” gasped Las Vegas, as if at the coming of a sudden beautiful hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom, I'm a preacher,” replied Roy, now earnestly. “You didn't know\n",
      "thet, but I am. An' I can marry you an' Bo as good as any one, an'\n",
      "tighter 'n most.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas reached for his friend as a drowning man might have reached\n",
      "for solid rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, can you really marry them--with my Bible--and the service of my\n",
      "church?” asked Helen, a happy hope flushing her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wal, indeed I can. I've married more 'n one couple whose religion\n",
      "wasn't mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“B-b-before--d-d-din-ner!” burst out Las Vegas, like a stuttering idiot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I reckon. Come on, now, an' make yourself pre-senttible,” said Roy.\n",
      "“Miss Helen, you tell Bo thet it's all settled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He picked up the halter on the blue mustang and turned away toward the\n",
      "corrals. Las Vegas put the bridle of his horse over his arm, and seemed\n",
      "to be following in a trance, with his dazed, rapt face held high.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bring Dale,” called Helen, softly after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So it came about as naturally as it was wonderful that Bo rode the blue\n",
      "mustang before the afternoon ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas disobeyed his first orders from Mrs. Tom Carmichael and rode\n",
      "out after her toward the green-rising range. Helen seemed impelled to\n",
      "follow. She did not need to ask Dale the second time. They rode swiftly,\n",
      "but never caught up with Bo and Las Vegas, whose riding resembled their\n",
      "happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale read Helen's mind, or else his own thoughts were in harmony with\n",
      "hers, for he always seemed to speak what she was thinking. And as they\n",
      "rode homeward he asked her in his quiet way if they could not spare a\n",
      "few days to visit his old camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And take Bo--and Tom? Oh, of all things I'd like to'” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes--an' Roy, too,” added Dale, significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” said Helen, lightly, as if she had not caught his meaning.\n",
      "But she turned her eyes away, while her heart thumped disgracefully and\n",
      "all her body was aglow. “Will Tom and Bo go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was Tom who got me to ask you,” replied Dale. “John an' Hal can look\n",
      "after the men while we're gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--so Tom put it in your head? I guess--maybe--I won't go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is always in my mind, Nell,” he said, with his slow seriousness.\n",
      "“I'm goin' to work all my life for you. But I'll want to an' need to go\n",
      "back to the woods often.... An' if you ever stoop to marry me--an' make\n",
      "me the richest of men--you'll have to marry me up there where I fell in\n",
      "love with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! Did Las Vegas Tom Carmichael say that, too?” inquired Helen,\n",
      "softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, do you want to know what Las Vegas said?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By all means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He said this--an' not an hour ago. 'Milt, old hoss, let me give you a\n",
      "hunch. I'm a man of family now--an' I've been a devil with the wimmen\n",
      "in my day. I can see through 'em. Don't marry Nell Rayner in or near the\n",
      "house where I killed Beasley. She'd remember. An' don't let her remember\n",
      "thet day. Go off into the woods. Paradise Park! Bo an' me will go with\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen gave him her hand, while they walked the horses homeward in the\n",
      "long sunset shadows. In the fullness of that happy hour she had time for\n",
      "a grateful wonder at the keen penetration of the cowboy Carmichael. Dale\n",
      "had saved her life, but it was Las Vegas who had saved her happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not many days later, when again the afternoon shadows were slanting low,\n",
      "Helen rode out upon the promontory where the dim trail zigzagged far\n",
      "above Paradise Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy was singing as he drove the pack-burros down the slope; Bo and Las\n",
      "Vegas were trying to ride the trail two abreast, so they could hold\n",
      "hands; Dale had dismounted to stand beside Helen's horse, as she gazed\n",
      "down the shaggy black slopes to the beautiful wild park with its gray\n",
      "meadows and shining ribbons of brooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was July, and there were no golden-red glorious flames and blazes of\n",
      "color such as lingered in Helen's memory. Black spruce slopes and green\n",
      "pines and white streaks of aspens and lacy waterfall of foam and dark\n",
      "outcroppings of rock--these colors and forms greeted her gaze with all\n",
      "the old enchantment. Wildness, beauty, and loneliness were there, the\n",
      "same as ever, immutable, like the spirit of those heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen would fain have lingered longer, but the others called, and Ranger\n",
      "impatiently snorted his sense of the grass and water far below. And she\n",
      "knew that when she climbed there again to the wide outlook she would be\n",
      "another woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, come on,” said Dale, as he led on. “It's better to look up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had just sunk behind the ragged fringe of mountain-rim when\n",
      "those three strong and efficient men of the open had pitched camp and\n",
      "had prepared a bountiful supper. Then Roy Beeman took out the little\n",
      "worn Bible which Helen had given him to use when he married Bo, and as\n",
      "he opened it a light changed his dark face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Helen an' Dale,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arose to stand before him. And he married them there under the\n",
      "great, stately pines, with the fragrant blue smoke curling upward, and\n",
      "the wind singing through the branches, while the waterfall murmured its\n",
      "low, soft, dreamy music, and from the dark slope came the wild, lonely\n",
      "cry of a wolf, full of the hunger for life and a mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us pray,” said Roy, as he closed the Bible, and knelt with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is only one God, an' Him I beseech in my humble office for the\n",
      "woman an' man I have just wedded in holy bonds. Bless them an' watch\n",
      "them an' keep them through all the comin' years. Bless the sons of\n",
      "this strong man of the woods an' make them like him, with love an'\n",
      "understandin' of the source from which life comes. Bless the daughters\n",
      "of this woman an' send with them more of her love an' soul, which must\n",
      "be the softenin' an' the salvation of the hard West. O Lord, blaze the\n",
      "dim, dark trail for them through the unknown forest of life! O Lord,\n",
      "lead the way across the naked range of the future no mortal knows! We\n",
      "ask in Thy name! Amen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When the preacher stood up again and raised the couple from their\n",
      "kneeling posture, it seemed that a grave and solemn personage had left\n",
      "him. This young man was again the dark-faced, clear-eyed Roy, droll and\n",
      "dry, with the enigmatic smile on his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Dale,” he said, taking her hands, “I wish you joy.... An' now,\n",
      "after this here, my crownin' service in your behalf--I reckon I'll claim\n",
      "a reward.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he kissed her. Bo came next with her warm and loving felicitations,\n",
      "and the cowboy, with characteristic action, also made at Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, shore it's the only chance I'll ever have to kiss you,” he\n",
      "drawled. “Because when this heah big Indian once finds out what kissin'\n",
      "is--!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Las Vegas then proved how swift and hearty he could be upon occasions.\n",
      "All this left Helen red and confused and unutterably happy. She\n",
      "appreciated Dale's state. His eyes reflected the precious treasure\n",
      "which manifestly he saw, but realization of ownership had not yet become\n",
      "demonstrable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then with gay speech and happy laugh and silent look these five partook\n",
      "of the supper. When it was finished Roy made known his intention to\n",
      "leave. They all protested and coaxed, but to no avail. He only laughed\n",
      "and went on saddling his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, please stay,” implored Helen. “The day's almost ended. You're\n",
      "tired.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nope. I'll never be no third party when there's only two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there are four of us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn't I just make you an' Dale one?... An', Mrs. Dale, you forget I've\n",
      "been married more 'n once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen found herself confronted by an unanswerable side of the argument.\n",
      "Las Vegas rolled on the grass in his mirth. Dale looked strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Roy, then that's why you're so nice,” said Bo, with a little devil in\n",
      "her eyes. “Do you know I had my mind made up if Tom hadn't come around I\n",
      "was going to make up to you, Roy.... I sure was. What number wife would\n",
      "I have been?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It always took Bo to turn the tables on anybody. Roy looked mightily\n",
      "embarrassed. And the laugh was on him. He did not face them again until\n",
      "he had mounted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Las Vegas, I've done my best for you--hitched you to thet blue-eyed\n",
      "girl the best I know how,” he declared. “But I shore ain't guaranteein'\n",
      "nothin'. You'd better build a corral for her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Roy, you shore don't savvy the way to break these wild ones,”\n",
      " drawled Las Vegas. “Bo will be eatin' out of my hand in about a week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo's blue eyes expressed an eloquent doubt as to this extraordinary\n",
      "claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-by, friends,” said Roy, and rode away to disappear in the spruces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon Bo and Las Vegas forgot Roy, and Dale and Helen, the camp\n",
      "chores to be done, and everything else except themselves. Helen's first\n",
      "wifely duty was to insist that she should and could and would help her\n",
      "husband with the work of cleaning up after the sumptuous supper. Before\n",
      "they had finished a sound startled them. It came from Roy, evidently\n",
      "high on the darkening slope, and was a long, mellow pealing halloo, that\n",
      "rang on the cool air, burst the dreamy silence, and rapped across\n",
      "from slope to slope and cliff to cliff, to lose its power and die away\n",
      "hauntingly in the distant recesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale shook his head as if he did not care to attempt a reply to that\n",
      "beautiful call. Silence once again enfolded the park, and twilight\n",
      "seemed to be born of the air, drifting downward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nell, do you miss anythin'?” asked Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Nothing in all the world,” she murmured. “I am happier than I ever\n",
      "dared pray to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don't mean people or things. I mean my pets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! I had forgotten.... Milt, where are they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone back to the wild,” he said. “They had to live in my absence. An'\n",
      "I've been away long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the brooding silence, with its soft murmur of falling water\n",
      "and faint sigh of wind in the pines, was broken by a piercing scream,\n",
      "high, quivering, like that of a woman in exquisite agony.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That's Tom!” exclaimed Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh--I was so--so frightened!” whispered Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bo came running, with Las Vegas at her heels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Milt, that was your tame cougar,” cried Bo, excitedly. “Oh, I'll never\n",
      "forget him! I'll hear those cries in my dreams!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it was Tom,” said Dale, thoughtfully. “But I never heard him cry\n",
      "just like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, call him in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dale whistled and called, but Tom did not come. Then the hunter stalked\n",
      "off in the gloom to call from different points under the slope. After\n",
      "a while he returned without the cougar. And at that moment, from far\n",
      "up the dark ravine, drifted down the same wild cry, only changed by\n",
      "distance, strange and tragic in its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He scented us. He remembers. But he'll never come back,” said Dale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Helen felt stirred anew with the convictions of Dale's deep knowledge of\n",
      "life and nature. And her imagination seemed to have wings. How full and\n",
      "perfect her trust, her happiness in the realization that her love and\n",
      "her future, her children, and perhaps grandchildren, would come under\n",
      "the guidance of such a man! Only a little had she begun to comprehend\n",
      "the secrets of good and ill in their relation to the laws of nature.\n",
      "Ages before men had lived on the earth there had been the creatures of\n",
      "the wilderness, and the holes of the rocks, and the nests of the trees,\n",
      "and rain, frost, heat, dew, sunlight and night, storm and calm, the\n",
      "honey of the wildflower and the instinct of the bee--all the beautiful\n",
      "and multiple forms of life with their inscrutable design. To know\n",
      "something of them and to love them was to be close to the kingdom of\n",
      "earth--perhaps to the greater kingdom of heaven. For whatever breathed\n",
      "and moved was a part of that creation. The coo of the dove, the lichen\n",
      "on the mossy rock, the mourn of a hunting wolf, and the murmur of the\n",
      "waterfall, the ever-green and growing tips of the spruces, and the\n",
      "thunderbolts along the battlements of the heights--these one and all\n",
      "must be actuated by the great spirit--that incalculable thing in the\n",
      "universe which had produced man and soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there in the starlight, under the wide-gnarled pines, sighing low\n",
      "with the wind, Helen sat with Dale on the old stone that an avalanche\n",
      "of a million years past had flung from the rampart above to serve as\n",
      "camp-table and bench for lovers in the wilderness; the sweet scent of\n",
      "spruce mingled with the fragrance of wood-smoke blown in their faces.\n",
      "How white the stars, and calm and true! How they blazed their single\n",
      "task! A coyote yelped off on the south slope, dark now as midnight. A\n",
      "bit of weathered rock rolled and tapped from shelf to shelf. And the\n",
      "wind moaned. Helen felt all the sadness and mystery and nobility of this\n",
      "lonely fastness, and full on her heart rested the supreme consciousness\n",

Then, as the\\nfire dropped behind the domed peak, a change, a cold and darkening\\nblight, passed down the black spear pointed slopes over all that\\nmountain world.\\n\\nIt was a wild, richly timbered, and abundantly watered region of dark\\nforests and grassy parks, ten thousand feet above sea level, isolated\\non all sides by the southern Arizona desert  the virgin home of elk and\\ndeer, of bear and lion, of wolf and fox, and the birthplace as well as\\nthe hiding place of the fierce Apache.\\n\\nSeptember in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze\\nfollowing shortly after sundown. Twilight appeared to come on its wings,\\nas did faint sounds, not distinguishable before in the stillness.\\n\\nMilt Dale, man of the forest, halted at the edge of a timbered ridge, to\\nlisten and to watch. Beneath him lay a narrow valley, open and grassy,\\nfrom which rose a faint murmur of running water. Its music was pierced\\nby the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote. From overhead in the\\ngiant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the\\nnight; and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild\\nturkeys going to roost.\\n\\nTo Dale's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been,\\nbetokening an unchanged serenity of forestland. He was glad, for he had\\nexpected to hear the clipclop of white men's horses  which to hear up\\nin those fastnesses was hateful to him. He and the Indian were friends.\\nThat fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter. But there hid\\nsomewhere in the forest a gang of bad men, sheep thieves, whom Dale did\\nnot want to meet.\\n\\nAs he started out upon the slope, a sudden flaring of the afterglow of\\nsunset flooded down from Old Baldy, filling the valley with lights and\\nshadows, yellow and blue, like the radiance of the sky. The pools in the\\ncurves of the brook shone darkly bright. Dale's gaze swept up and down\\nthe valley, and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook\\nwhere the wall of spruce stood up, its speared and spiked crest against\\nthe pale clouds. The wind began to moan in the trees and there was a\\nfeeling of rain in the air. Dale, striking a trail, turned his back to\\nthe fading afterglow and strode down the valley.\\n\\nWith night at hand and a rain storm brewing, he did not head for his\\nown camp, some miles distant, but directed his steps toward an old log\\ncabin. When he reached it darkness had almost set in. He approached with\\ncaution. This cabin, like the few others scattered in the valleys, might\\nharbor Indians or a bear or a panther. Nothing, however, appeared to be\\nthere. Then Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky, and he felt\\nthe cool dampness of a fine, misty rain on his face. It would rain off\\nand on during the night. Whereupon he entered the cabin.\\n\\nAnd the next moment he heard quick hoof beats of trotting horses.\\nPeering out, he saw dim, moving forms in the darkness, quite close\\nat hand. They had approached against the wind so that sound had been\\ndeadened. Five horses with riders, Dale made out  saw them loom close.\\nThen he heard rough voices. Quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a\\nladder he knew led to a loft; and finding it, he quickly mounted, taking\\ncare not to make a noise with his rifle, and lay down upon the floor\\nof brush and poles. Scarcely had he done so when heavy steps, with\\naccompaniment of clinking spurs, passed through the door below into the\\ncabin.\\n\\n“Wal, Beasley, are you here?” queried a loud voice.\\n\\nThere was no reply. The man below growled under his breath, and again\\nthe spurs jingled.\\n\\n“Fellars, Beasley ain't here yet,” he called. “Put the hosses under the\\nshed. We'll wait.”\\n\\n“Wait, huh!” came a harsh reply. “Mebbe all night  an' we got nuthin' to\\neat.”\\n\\n“Shut up, Moze. Reckon you're no good for anythin' but eatin'. Put them\\nhosses away an' some of you rustle fire wood in here.”\\n\\nLow, muttered curses, then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain\\nof leather and heaves of tired horses.\\n\\nAnother shuffling, clinking footstep entered the cabin.\\n\\n“Snake, it'd been sense to fetch a pack along,” drawled this newcomer.\\n\\n“Reckon so, Jim. But we didn't, an' what's the use hollerin'? Beasley\\nwon't keep us waitin' long.”\\n\\nDale, lying still and prone, felt a slow start in all his blood  a\\nthrilling wave. That deep voiced man below was Snake Anson, the worst\\nand most dangerous character of the region; and the others, undoubtedly,\\ncomposed his gang, long notorious in that sparsely settled country.\\nAnd the Beasley mentioned  he was one of the two biggest ranchers and\\nsheep raisers of the White Mountain ranges. What was the meaning of\\na rendezvous between Snake Anson and Beasley? Milt Dale answered that\\nquestion to Beasley's discredit; and many strange matters pertaining to\\nsheep and herders, always a mystery to the little village of Pine, now\\nbecame as clear as daylight.\\n\\nOther men entered the cabin.\\n\\n“It ain't a goin' to rain much,” said one. Then came a crash of wood\\nthrown to the ground.\\n\\n“Jim, hyar's a chunk of pine log, dry as punk,” said another.\\n\\nRustlings and slow footsteps, and then heavy thuds attested to the\\nprobability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to\\nsplit off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured.\\n\\n“Snake, lemme your pipe, an' I'll hev a fire in a jiffy.”\\n\\n“Wal, I want my terbacco an' I ain't carin' about no fire,” replied\\nSnake.\\n\\n“Reckon you're the meanest cuss in these woods,” drawled Jim.\\n\\nSharp click of steel on flint  many times  and then a sound of hard\\nblowing and sputtering told of Jim's efforts to start a fire. Presently\\nthe pitchy blackness of the cabin changed; there came a little crackling\\nof wood and the rustle of flame, and then a steady growing roar.\\n\\nAs it chanced, Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft, and right\\nnear his eyes there were cracks between the boughs. When the fire blazed\\nup he was fairly well able to see the men below. The only one he had\\never seen was Jim Wilson, who had been well known at Pine before Snake\\nAnson had ever been heard of. Jim was the best of a bad lot, and he had\\nfriends among the honest people. It was rumored that he and Snake did\\nnot pull well together.\\n\\n“Fire feels good,” said the burly Moze, who appeared as broad as he was\\nblack visaged. “Fall's sure a comin'... Now if only we had some grub!”\\n\\n“Moze, there's a hunk of deer meat in my saddle bag, an' if you git it\\nyou can have half,” spoke up another voice.\\n\\nMoze shuffled out with alacrity.\\n\\nIn the firelight Snake Anson's face looked lean and serpent like, his\\neyes glittered, and his long neck and all of his long length carried out\\nthe analogy of his name.\\n\\n“Snake, what's this here deal with Beasley?” inquired Jim.\\n\\n“Reckon you'll l'arn when I do,” replied the leader. He appeared tired\\nand thoughtful.\\n\\n“Ain't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herders  for\\nnothin'?” queried the youngest of the gang, a boy in years, whose hard,\\nbitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades.\\n\\n“You're dead right, Burt  an' that's my stand,” replied the man who\\nhad sent Moze out. “Snake, snow 'll be flyin' round these woods before\\nlong,” said Jim Wilson. “Are we goin' to winter down in the Tonto Basin\\nor over on the Gila?”\\n\\n“Reckon we'll do some tall ridin' before we strike south,” replied\\nSnake, gruffly.\\n\\nAt the juncture Moze returned.\\n\\n“Boss, I heerd a hoss comin' up the trail,” he said.\\n\\nSnake rose and stood at the door, listening. Outside the wind moaned\\nfitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin.\\n\\n“A huh!” exclaimed Snake, in relief.\\n\\nSilence ensued then for a moment, at the end of which interval Dale\\nheard a rapid clip clop on the rocky trail outside. The men below\\nshuffled uneasily, but none of them spoke. The fire cracked cheerily.\\nSnake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that\\nexpressed both doubt and caution.\\n\\nThe trotting horse had halted out there somewhere.\\n\\n“Ho there, inside!” called a voice from the darkness.\\n\\n“Ho yourself!” replied Anson.\\n\\n“That you, Snake?” quickly followed the query.\\n\\n“Reckon so,” returned Anson, showing himself.\\n\\nThe newcomer entered. He was a large man, wearing a slicker that shone\\nwet in the firelight. His sombrero, pulled well down, shadowed his face,\\nso that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked.\\nHe had a black, drooping mustache, and a chin like a rock. A potential\\nforce, matured and powerful, seemed to be wrapped in his movements.\\n\\n“Hullo, Snake! Hullo, Wilson!” he said. “I've backed out on the other\\ndeal. Sent for you on  on another little matter... particular private.”\\n\\nHere he indicated with a significant gesture that Snake's men were to\\nleave the cabin.\\n\\n“A huh! ejaculated Anson, dubiously. Then he turned abruptly. Moze,\\nyou an' Shady an' Burt go wait outside. Reckon this ain't the deal I\\nexpected... An' you can saddle the hosses.”\\n\\nThe three members of the gang filed out, all glancing keenly at the\\nstranger, who had moved back into the shadow.\\n\\n“All right now, Beasley,” said Anson, low voiced. “What's your game?\\nJim, here, is in on my deals.”\\n\\nThen Beasley came forward to the fire, stretching his hands to the\\nblaze.\\n\\n“Nothin' to do with sheep,” replied he.\\n\\n“Wal, I reckoned not,” assented the other. “An' say  whatever your game\\nis, I ain't likin' the way you kept me waitin' an' ridin' around. We\\nwaited near all day at Big Spring. Then thet greaser rode up an' sent us\\nhere. We're a long way from camp with no grub an' no blankets.”\\n\\n“I won't keep you long,” said Beasley. “But even if I did you'd not\\nmind  when I tell you this deal concerns Al Auchincloss  the man who\\nmade an outlaw of you!”\\n\\nAnson's sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame. Wilson,\\nlikewise, bent forward eagerly. Beasley glanced at the door  then began\\nto whisper.\\n\\n“Old Auchincloss is on his last legs. He's goin' to croak. He's sent\\nback to Missouri for a niece  a young girl  an' he means to leave his\\nranches an' sheep  all his stock to her. Seems he has no one else...\\nThem ranches  an' all them sheep an' hosses! You know me an' Al were\\npardners in sheep raisin' for years. He swore I cheated him an' he threw\\nme out. An' all these years I've been swearin' he did me dirt  owed me\\nsheep an' money. I've got as many friends in Pine  an' all the way down\\nthe trail  as Auchincloss has... An' Snake, see here  ”\\n\\nHe paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the\\nblaze. Anson leaned forward, like a serpent ready to strike, and Jim\\nWilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand.\\n\\n“See here,” panted Beasley. “The girl's due to arrive at Magdalena on\\nthe sixteenth. That's a week from to morrow. She'll take the stage to\\nSnowdrop, where some of Auchincloss's men will meet her with a team.”\\n\\n“A huh!” grunted Anson as Beasley halted again. “An' what of all thet?”\\n\\n“She mustn't never get as far as Snowdrop!”\\n\\n“You want me to hold up the stage  an' get the girl?”\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\n“Wal  an' what then?”\\n\\n“Make off with her... She disappears. That's your affair. ... I'll\\npress my claims on Auchincloss  hound him  an' be ready when he croaks\\nto take over his property. Then the girl can come back, for all I\\ncare... You an' Wilson fix up the deal between you. If you have to let\\nthe gang in on it don't give them any hunch as to who an' what. This 'll\\nmake you a rich stake. An' providin', when it's paid, you strike for new\\nterritory.”\\n\\n“Thet might be wise,” muttered Snake Anson. “Beasley, the weak point in\\nyour game is the uncertainty of life. Old Al is tough. He may fool you.”\\n\\n“Auchincloss is a dyin' man,” declared Beasley, with such positiveness\\nthat it could not be doubted.\\n\\n“Wal, he sure wasn't plumb hearty when I last seen him... Beasley, in\\ncase I play your game  how'm I to know that girl?”\\n\\n“Her name's Helen Rayner,” replied Beasley, eagerly. “She's twenty\\nyears old. All of them Auchinclosses was handsome an' they say she's the\\nhandsomest.”\\n\\n“A huh!... Beasley, this 's sure a bigger deal  an' one I ain't\\nfancyin'... But I never doubted your word... Come on  an' talk out.\\nWhat's in it for me?”\\n\\n“Don't let any one in on this. You two can hold up the stage. Why, it\\nwas never held up... But you want to mask... How about ten thousand\\nsheep  or what they bring at Phenix in gold?”\\n\\nJim Wilson whistled low.\\n\\n“An' leave for new territory?” repeated Snake Anson, under his breath.\\n\\n“You've said it.”\\n\\n“Wal, I ain't fancyin' the girl end of this deal, but you can count on\\nme... September sixteenth at Magdalena  an' her name's Helen  an' she's\\nhandsome?”\\n\\n“Yes. My herders will begin drivin' south in about two weeks. Later, if\\nthe weather holds good, send me word by one of them an' I'll meet you.”\\n\\nBeasley spread his hands once more over the blaze, pulled on his gloves\\nand pulled down his sombrero, and with an abrupt word of parting strode\\nout into the night.\\n\\n“Jim, what do you make of him?” queried Snake Anson.\\n\\n“Pard, he's got us beat two ways for Sunday,” replied Wilson.\\n\\n“A huh!... Wal, let's get back to camp.” And he led the way out.\\n\\nLow voices drifted into the cabin, then came snorts of horses and\\nstriking hoofs, and after that a steady trot, gradually ceasing.\\nOnce more the moan of wind and soft patter of rain filled the forest\\nstillness.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nMilt Dale quietly sat up to gaze, with thoughtful eyes, into the gloom.\\n\\nHe was thirty years old. As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his\\nschool and home in Iowa and, joining a wagon train of pioneers, he was\\none of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the White\\nMountains. But he had not taken kindly to farming or sheep raising or\\nmonotonous home toil, and for twelve years he had lived in the forest,\\nwith only infrequent visits to Pine and Show Down and Snowdrop. This\\nwandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for\\nthe villagers, for he did care, and he was welcome everywhere, but\\nthat he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive\\ninstinctive force of a savage.\\n\\nAnd on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one\\nof all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a\\nfriend.\\n\\n“That man Beasley!” he soliloquized. “Beasley  in cahoots with Snake\\nAnson!... Well, he was right. Al Auchincloss is on his last legs. Poor\\nold man! When I tell him he'll never believe ME, that's sure!”\\n\\nDiscovery of the plot meant to Dale that he must hurry down to Pine.\\n\\n“A girl  Helen Rayner  twenty years old,” he mused. “Beasley wants her\\nmade off with... That means  worse than killed!”\\n\\nDale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired\\nby one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore. Bad men worked\\ntheir evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer. He had shot wolves for\\nthat trick. With men, good or bad, he had not clashed. Old women and\\nchildren appealed to him, but he had never had any interest in girls.\\nThe image, then, of this Helen Rayner came strangely to Dale; and he\\nsuddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent Beasley, not\\nto befriend old Al Auchincloss, but for the sake of the girl. Probably\\nshe was already on her way West, alone, eager, hopeful of a future home.\\nHow little people guessed what awaited them at a journey's end! Many\\ntrails ended abruptly in the forest  and only trained woodsmen could\\nread the tragedy.\\n\\n“Strange how I cut across country to day from Spruce Swamp,” reflected\\nDale. Circumstances, movements, usually were not strange to him. His\\nmethods and habits were seldom changed by chance. The matter, then, of\\nhis turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason, and\\nof his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl, was\\nindeed an adventure to provoke thought. It provoked more, for Dale grew\\nconscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins. He who had\\nlittle to do with the strife of men, and nothing to do with anger, felt\\nhis blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl.\\n\\n“Old Al won't listen to me,” pondered Dale. “An' even if he did, he\\nwouldn't believe me. Maybe nobody will... All the same, Snake Anson\\nwon't get that girl.”\\n\\nWith these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position, and\\nhis pondering ceased. Taking his rifle, he descended from the loft and\\npeered out of the door. The night had grown darker, windier, cooler;\\nbroken clouds were scudding across the sky; only a few stars showed;\\nfine rain was blowing from the northwest; and the forest seemed full of\\na low, dull roar.\\n\\n“Reckon I'd better hang up here,” he said, and turned to the fire. The\\ncoals were red now. From the depths of his hunting coat he procured a\\nlittle bag of salt and some strips of dried meat. These strips he laid\\nfor a moment on the hot embers, until they began to sizzle and curl;\\nthen with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter\\ngrateful for little.\\n\\nHe sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of\\nthe fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing, glowing, golden embers.\\nOutside, the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased\\nto a roar. Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him, drowsily\\nlulling; and he heard the storm wind in the trees, now like a waterfall,\\nand anon like a retreating army, and again low and sad; and he saw\\npictures in the glowing embers, strange as dreams.\\n\\nPresently he rose and, climbing to the loft, he stretched himself out,\\nand soon fell asleep.\\n\\n\\nWhen the gray dawn broke he was on his way, 'cross country, to the\\nvillage of Pine.\\n\\nDuring the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased. A\\nsuspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places. All was gray  the\\nparks, the glades  and deeper, darker gray marked the aisles of the\\nforest. Shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent\\nwith spectral forms. Then the east kindled, the gray lightened, the\\ndreaming woodland awoke to the far reaching rays of a bursting red sun.\\n\\nThis was always the happiest moment of Dale's lonely days, as sunset\\nwas his saddest. He responded, and there was something in his blood that\\nanswered the whistle of a stag from a near by ridge. His strides were\\nlong, noiseless, and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the\\ndew laden grass.\\n\\nDale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest\\nclimbing, but the “senacas”  those parklike meadows so named by Mexican\\nsheep herders  were as round and level as if they had been made by man\\nin beautiful contrast to the dark green, rough, and rugged ridges. Both\\nopen senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance\\nof game. The cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the\\nspruces, a round black lumbering object, a twittering in the brush,\\nand stealthy steps, were all easy signs for Dale to read. Once, as he\\nnoiselessly emerged into a little glade, he espied a red fox stalking\\nsome quarry, which, as he advanced, proved to be a flock of partridges.\\nThey whirred up, brushing the branches, and the fox trotted away. In\\nevery senaca Dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the\\nhigh grass.\\n\\nIt had always been his custom, on his visits to Pine, to kill and\\npack fresh meat down to several old friends, who were glad to give him\\nlodging. And, hurried though he was now, he did not intend to make an\\nexception of this trip.\\n\\nAt length he got down into the pine belt, where the great, gnarled,\\nyellow trees soared aloft, stately, and aloof from one another, and the\\nground was a brown, odorous, springy mat of pine needles, level as a\\nfloor. Squirrels watched him from all around, scurrying away at his\\nnear approach  tiny, brown, light striped squirrels, and larger ones,\\nrusset colored, and the splendid dark grays with their white bushy tails\\nand plumed ears.\\n\\nThis belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide, gray, rolling, open land,\\nalmost like a prairie, with foot hills lifting near and far, and the\\nred gold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun. Here Dale\\nflushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their\\nsubdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build,\\nshowed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock. They began\\nto run pell mell out into the grass, until only their heads appeared\\nbobbing along, and finally disappeared. Dale caught a glimpse of\\nskulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys, and as\\nthey saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the\\nhindmost. His bullet struck low, as he had meant it to, but too low, and\\nthe coyote got only a dusting of earth and pine needles thrown up into\\nhis face. This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt\\ninto a tree, rolled over, gained his feet, and then the cover of the\\nforest. Dale was amused at this. His hand was against all the predatory\\nbeasts of the forest, though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf\\nand fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the\\ngentle, beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed. But some he\\nloved better than others, and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty.\\n\\nHe crossed the wide, grassy plain and struck another gradual descent\\nwhere aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm, sun lighted\\nglades bordered along a sparkling brook. Here he heard a turkey gobble,\\nand that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching,\\nsilent detour around a clump of aspens. In a sunny patch of grass\\na dozen or more big gobblers stood, all suspiciously facing in his\\ndirection, heads erect, with that wild aspect peculiar to their species.\\nOld wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk. Dale\\nshot two of them. The others began to run like ostriches, thudding over\\nthe ground, spreading their wings, and with that running start launched\\ntheir heavy bodies into whirring flight. They flew low, at about the\\nheight of a man from the grass, and vanished in the woods.\\n\\nDale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way. Soon\\nhe came to a break in the forest level, from which he gazed down a\\nleague long slope of pine and cedar, out upon the bare, glistening\\ndesert, stretching away, endlessly rolling out to the dim, dark horizon\\nline.\\n\\nThe little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered\\nforest. A road, running parallel with a dark watered, swift flowing\\nstream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue\\nsmoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow\\nin the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted\\nwith horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site\\nappeared to be a natural clearing, for there was no evidence of cut\\ntimber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene,\\ntranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and\\nhappy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.\\n\\nDale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden\\nbordered with sunflowers. His call was answered by an old woman, gray\\nand bent, but remarkably spry, who appeared at the door.\\n\\n“Why, land's sakes, if it ain't Milt Dale!” she exclaimed, in welcome.\\n\\n“Reckon it's me, Mrs. Cass,” he replied. “An' I've brought you a\\nturkey.”\\n\\n“Milt, you're that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass... What\\na gobbler! First one I've seen this fall. My man Tom used to fetch home\\ngobblers like that... An' mebbe he'll come home again sometime.”\\n\\nHer husband, Tom Cass, had gone into the forest years before and had\\nnever returned. But the old woman always looked for him and never gave\\nup hope.\\n\\n“Men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back,” replied Dale, as\\nhe had said to her many a time.\\n\\n“Come right in. You air hungry, I know. Now, son, when last did you eat\\na fresh egg or a flapjack?”\\n\\n“You should remember,” he answered, laughing, as he followed her into a\\nsmall, clean kitchen.\\n\\n“Laws a' me! An' thet's months ago,” she replied, shaking her gray head.\\n“Milt, you should give up that wild life  an' marry  an' have a home.”\\n\\n“You always tell me that.”\\n\\n“Yes, an' I'll see you do it yet... Now you set there, an' pretty soon\\nI'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water.”\\n\\n“What's the news, Auntie?” he asked.\\n\\n“Nary news in this dead place. Why, nobody's been to Snowdrop in two\\nweeks!... Sary Jones died, poor old soul  she's better off  an' one of\\nmy cows run away. Milt, she's wild when she gits loose in the woods.\\nAn' you'll have to track her, 'cause nobody else can. An' John Dakker's\\nheifer was killed by a lion, an' Lem Harden's fast hoss  you know his\\nfavorite  was stole by hoss thieves. Lem is jest crazy. An' that reminds\\nme, Milt, where's your big ranger, thet you'd never sell or lend?”\\n\\n“My horses are up in the woods, Auntie; safe, I reckon, from\\nhorse thieves.”\\n\\n“Well, that's a blessin'. We've had some stock stole this summer, Milt,\\nan' no mistake.”\\n\\nThus, while preparing a meal for Dale, the old woman went on recounting\\nall that had happened in the little village since his last visit. Dale\\nenjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy, and it was exceedingly good\\nto sit at her table. In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been\\nsuch butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple\\npie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of\\nDale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest.\\n\\n“How's old Al Auchincloss?” presently inquired Dale.\\n\\n“Poorly  poorly,” sighed Mrs. Cass. “But he tramps an' rides around\\nsame as ever. Al's not long for this world... An', Milt, that reminds\\nme  there's the biggest news you ever heard.”\\n\\n“You don't say so!” exclaimed Dale, to encourage the excited old woman.\\n\\n“Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece, Helen Rayner. She's to\\ninherit all his property. We've heard much of her  a purty lass, they\\nsay... Now, Milt Dale, here's your chance. Stay out of the woods an' go\\nto work... You can marry that girl!”\\n\\n“No chance for me, Auntie,” replied Dale, smiling.\\n\\nThe old woman snorted. “Much you know! Any girl would have you, Milt\\nDale, if you'd only throw a kerchief.”\\n\\n“Me!... An' why, Auntie?” he queried, half amused, half thoughtful. When\\nhe got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the\\nideas of people.\\n\\n“Why? I declare, Milt, you live so in the woods you're like a boy of\\nten  an' then sometimes as old as the hills... There's no young man to\\ncompare with you, hereabouts. An' this girl  she'll have all the spunk\\nof the Auchinclosses.”\\n\\n“Then maybe she'd not be such a catch, after all,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Wal, you've no cause to love them, that's sure. But, Milt, the\\nAuchincloss women are always good wives.”\\n\\n“Dear Auntie, you're dreamin',” said Dale, soberly. “I want no wife. I'm\\nhappy in the woods.”\\n\\n“Air you goin' to live like an Injun all your days, Milt Dale?” she\\nqueried, sharply.\\n\\n“I hope so.”\\n\\n“You ought to be ashamed. But some lass will change you, boy, an' mebbe\\nit'll be this Helen Rayner. I hope an' pray so to thet.”\\n\\n“Auntie, supposin' she did change me. She'd never change old Al. He\\nhates me, you know.”\\n\\n“Wal, I ain't so sure, Milt. I met Al the other day. He inquired for\\nyou, an' said you was wild, but he reckoned men like you was good for\\npioneer settlements. Lord knows the good turns you've done this village!\\nMilt, old Al doesn't approve of your wild life, but he never had no hard\\nfeelin's till thet tame lion of yours killed so many of his sheep.”\\n\\n“Auntie, I don't believe Tom ever killed Al's sheep,” declared Dale,\\npositively.\\n\\n“Wal, Al thinks so, an' many other people,” replied Mrs. Cass, shaking\\nher gray head doubtfully. “You never swore he didn't. An' there was them\\ntwo sheep herders who did swear they seen him.”\\n\\n“They only saw a cougar. An' they were so scared they ran.”\\n\\n“Who wouldn't? Thet big beast is enough to scare any one. For land's\\nsakes, don't ever fetch him down here again! I'll never forgit the time\\nyou did. All the folks an' children an' hosses in Pine broke an' run\\nthet day.”\\n\\n“Yes; but Tom wasn't to blame. Auntie, he's the tamest of my pets.\\nDidn't he try to put his head on your lap an' lick your hand?”\\n\\n“Wal, Milt, I ain't gainsayin' your cougar pet didn't act better 'n a\\nlot of people I know. Fer he did. But the looks of him an' what's been\\nsaid was enough for me.”\\n\\n“An' what's all that, Auntie?”\\n\\n“They say he's wild when out of your sight. An' thet he'd trail an' kill\\nanythin' you put him after.”\\n\\n“I trained him to be just that way.”\\n\\n“Wal, leave Tom to home up in the woods  when you visit us.”\\n\\nDale finished his hearty meal, and listened awhile longer to the old\\nwoman's talk; then, taking his rifle and the other turkey, he bade her\\ngood by. She followed him out.\\n\\n“Now, Milt, you'll come soon again, won't you  jest to see Al's\\nniece  who'll be here in a week?”\\n\\n“I reckon I'll drop in some day... Auntie, have you seen my friends,\\nthe Mormon boys?”\\n\\n“No, I 'ain't seen them an' don't want to,” she retorted. “Milt Dale, if\\nany one ever corrals you it'll be Mormons.”\\n\\n“Don't worry, Auntie. I like those boys. They often see me up in the\\nwoods an' ask me to help them track a hoss or help kill some fresh\\nmeat.”\\n\\n“They're workin' for Beasley now.”\\n\\n“Is that so?” rejoined Dale, with a sudden start. “An' what doin'?”\\n\\n“Beasley is gettin' so rich he's buildin' a fence, an' didn't have\\nenough help, so I hear.”\\n\\n“Beasley gettin' rich!” repeated Dale, thoughtfully. “More sheep an'\\nhorses an' cattle than ever, I reckon?”\\n\\n“Laws a' me! Why, Milt, Beasley 'ain't any idea what he owns. Yes, he's\\nthe biggest man in these parts, since poor old Al's took to failin'. I\\nreckon Al's health ain't none improved by Beasley's success. They've bad\\nsome bitter quarrels lately  so I hear. Al ain't what he was.”\\n\\nDale bade good by again to his old friend and strode away, thoughtful\\nand serious. Beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent, but he\\nwould be dangerous to oppose. There did not appear much doubt of his\\ndriving his way rough shod to the dominance of affairs there in Pine.\\nDale, passing down the road, began to meet acquaintances who had\\nhearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings, so that his\\npondering was interrupted for the time being. He carried the turkey to\\nanother old friend, and when he left her house he went on to the village\\nstore. This was a large log cabin, roughly covered with clapboards, with\\na wide plank platform in front and a hitching rail in the road. Several\\nhorses were standing there, and a group of lazy, shirt sleeved loungers.\\n\\n“I'll be doggoned if it ain't Milt Dale!” exclaimed one.\\n\\n“Howdy, Milt, old buckskin! Right down glad to see you,” greeted\\nanother.\\n\\n“Hello, Dale! You air shore good for sore eyes,” drawled still another.\\n\\nAfter a long period of absence Dale always experienced a singular warmth\\nof feeling when he met these acquaintances. It faded quickly when he got\\nback to the intimacy of his woodland, and that was because the people of\\nPine, with few exceptions  though they liked him and greatly admired his\\noutdoor wisdom  regarded him as a sort of nonentity. Because he loved\\nthe wild and preferred it to village and range life, they had classed\\nhim as not one of them. Some believed him lazy; others believed him\\nshiftless; others thought him an Indian in mind and habits; and there\\nwere many who called him slow witted. Then there was another side to\\ntheir regard for him, which always afforded him good natured amusement.\\nTwo of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison; another\\nwanted to hunt with him. Lem Harden came out of the store and appealed\\nto Dale to recover his stolen horse. Lem's brother wanted a wild running\\nmare tracked and brought home. Jesse Lyons wanted a colt broken, and\\nbroken with patience, not violence, as was the method of the hard riding\\nboys at Pine. So one and all they besieged Dale with their selfish\\nneeds, all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures. And\\non the moment there happened by two women whose remarks, as they entered\\nthe store, bore strong testimony to Dale's personality.\\n\\n“If there ain't Milt Dale!” exclaimed the older of the two. “How lucky!\\nMy cow's sick, an' the men are no good doctorin'. I'll jest ask Milt\\nover.”\\n\\n“No one like Milt!” responded the other woman, heartily.\\n\\n“Good day there  you Milt Dale!” called the first speaker. “When you git\\naway from these lazy men come over.”\\n\\nDale never refused a service, and that was why his infrequent visits to\\nPine were wont to be prolonged beyond his own pleasure.\\n\\nPresently Beasley strode down the street, and when about to enter the\\nstore he espied Dale.\\n\\n“Hullo there, Milt!” he called, cordially, as he came forward with\\nextended hand. His greeting was sincere, but the lightning glance he\\nshot over Dale was not born of his pleasure. Seen in daylight, Beasley\\nwas a big, bold, bluff man, with strong, dark features. His aggressive\\npresence suggested that he was a good friend and a bad enemy.\\n\\nDale shook hands with him.\\n\\n“How are you, Beasley?”\\n\\n“Ain't complainin', Milt, though I got more work than I can rustle.\\nReckon you wouldn't take a job bossin' my sheep herders?”\\n\\n“Reckon I wouldn't,” replied Dale. “Thanks all the same.”\\n\\n“What's goin' on up in the woods?”\\n\\n“Plenty of turkey an' deer. Lots of bear, too. The Indians have worked\\nback on the south side early this fall. But I reckon winter will come\\nlate an' be mild.”\\n\\n“Good! An' where 're you headin' from?”\\n\\n“'Cross country from my camp,” replied Dale, rather evasively.\\n\\n“Your camp! Nobody ever found that yet,” declared Beasley, gruffly.\\n\\n“It's up there,” said Dale.\\n\\n“Reckon you've got that cougar chained in your cabin door?” queried\\nBeasley, and there was a barely distinguishable shudder of his muscular\\nframe. Also the pupils dilated in his hard brown eyes.\\n\\n“Tom ain't chained. An' I haven't no cabin, Beasley.”\\n\\n“You mean to tell me that big brute stays in your camp without bein'\\nhog tied or corralled!” demanded Beasley.\\n\\n“Sure he does.”\\n\\n“Beats me! But, then, I'm queer on cougars. Have had many a cougar trail\\nme at night. Ain't sayin' I was scared. But I don't care for that brand\\nof varmint... Milt, you goin' to stay down awhile?”\\n\\n“Yes, I'll hang around some.”\\n\\n“Come over to the ranch. Glad to see you any time. Some old huntin'\\npards of yours are workin' for me.”\\n\\n“Thanks, Beasley. I reckon I'll come over.”\\n\\nBeasley turned away and took a step, and then, as if with an\\nafter thought, he wheeled again.\\n\\n“Suppose you've heard about old Al Auchincloss bein' near petered out?”\\n queried Beasley. A strong, ponderous cast of thought seemed to emanate\\nfrom his features. Dale divined that Beasley's next step would be to\\nfurther his advancement by some word or hint.\\n\\n“Widow Cass was tellin' me all the news. Too bad about old Al,” replied\\nDale.\\n\\n“Sure is. He's done for. An' I'm sorry  though Al's never been square  ”\\n\\n“Beasley,” interrupted Dale, quickly, “you can't say that to me. Al\\nAuchincloss always was the whitest an' squarest man in this sheep\\ncountry.”\\n\\nBeasley gave Dale a fleeting, dark glance.\\n\\n“Dale, what you think ain't goin' to influence feelin' on this range,”\\n returned Beasley, deliberately. “You live in the woods an'  ”\\n\\n“Reckon livin' in the woods I might think  an' know a whole lot,”\\n interposed Dale, just as deliberately. The group of men exchanged\\nsurprised glances. This was Milt Dale in different aspect. And Beasley\\ndid not conceal a puzzled surprise.\\n\\n“About what  now?” he asked, bluntly.\\n\\n“Why, about what's goin' on in Pine,” replied Dale.\\n\\nSome of the men laughed.\\n\\n“Shore lots goin' on  an' no mistake,” put in Lem Harden.\\n\\nProbably the keen Beasley had never before considered Milt Dale as a\\nresponsible person; certainly never one in any way to cross his trail.\\nBut on the instant, perhaps, some instinct was born, or he divined an\\nantagonism in Dale that was both surprising and perplexing.\\n\\n“Dale, I've differences with Al Auchincloss  have had them for years,”\\n said Beasley. “Much of what he owns is mine. An' it's goin' to come to\\nme. Now I reckon people will be takin' sides  some for me an' some for\\nAl. Most are for me... Where do you stand? Al Auchincloss never had no\\nuse for you, an' besides he's a dyin' man. Are you goin' on his side?”\\n\\n“Yes, I reckon I am.”\\n\\n“Wal, I'm glad you've declared yourself,” rejoined Beasley, shortly,\\nand he strode away with the ponderous gait of a man who would brush any\\nobstacle from his path.\\n\\n“Milt, thet's bad  makin' Beasley sore at you,” said Lem Harden. “He's\\non the way to boss this outfit.”\\n\\n“He's sure goin' to step into Al's boots,” said another.\\n\\n“Thet was white of Milt to stick up fer poor old Al,” declared Lem's\\nbrother.\\n\\nDale broke away from them and wended a thoughtful way down the road. The\\nburden of what he knew about Beasley weighed less heavily upon him, and\\nthe close lipped course he had decided upon appeared wisest. He needed\\nto think before undertaking to call upon old Al Auchincloss; and to that\\nend he sought an hour's seclusion under the pines.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nIn the afternoon, Dale, having accomplished some tasks imposed upon him\\nby his old friends at Pine, directed slow steps toward the Auchincloss\\nranch.\\n\\nThe flat, square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon\\na little hill half a mile out of the village. A home as well as a fort,\\nit had been the first structure erected in that region, and the process\\nof building had more than once been interrupted by Indian attacks.\\nThe Apaches had for some time, however, confined their fierce raids to\\npoints south of the White Mountain range. Auchincloss's house looked\\ndown upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes, and\\nhundreds of acres of well cultivated soil. Fields of oats waved gray and\\nyellow in the afternoon sun; an immense green pasture was divided by a\\nwillow bordered brook, and here were droves of horses, and out on the\\nrolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle.\\n\\nThe whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of\\nman. The brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the\\nvillage. Water for the house, however, came down from the high, wooded\\nslope of the mountain, and had been brought there by a simple expedient.\\nPine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end, with a deep trough\\ncut in them, and they made a shining line down the slope, across the\\nvalley, and up the little hill to the Auchincloss home. Near the house\\nthe hollowed halves of logs had been bound together, making a crude\\npipe. Water ran uphill in this case, one of the facts that made the\\nranch famous, as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small\\nboys of Pine. The two good women who managed Auchincloss's large\\nhousehold were often shocked by the strange things that floated into\\ntheir kitchen with the ever flowing stream of clear, cold mountain\\nwater.\\n\\nAs it happened this day Dale encountered Al Auchincloss sitting in the\\nshade of a porch, talking to some of his sheep herders and stockmen.\\nAuchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width\\nof shoulder. He had no gray hairs, and he did not look old, yet there\\nwas in his face a certain weariness, something that resembled sloping\\nlines of distress, dim and pale, that told of age and the ebb tide of\\nvitality. His features, cast in large mold, were clean cut and comely,\\nand he had frank blue eyes, somewhat sad, yet still full of spirit.\\n\\nDale had no idea how his visit would be taken, and he certainly would\\nnot have been surprised to be ordered off the place. He had not set foot\\nthere for years. Therefore it was with surprise that he saw Auchincloss\\nwave away the herders and take his entrance without any particular\\nexpression.\\n\\n“Howdy, Al! How are you?” greeted Dale, easily, as he leaned his rifle\\nagainst the log wall.\\n\\nAuchincloss did not rise, but he offered his hand.\\n\\n“Wal, Milt Dale, I reckon this is the first time I ever seen you that I\\ncouldn't lay you flat on your back,” replied the rancher. His tone was\\nboth testy and full of pathos.\\n\\n“I take it you mean you ain't very well,” replied Dale. “I'm sorry, Al.”\\n\\n“No, it ain't thet. Never was sick in my life. I'm just played out, like\\na hoss thet had been strong an' willin', an' did too much... Wal, you\\ndon't look a day older, Milt. Livin' in the woods rolls over a man's\\nhead.”\\n\\n“Yes, I'm feelin' fine, an' time never bothers me.”\\n\\n“Wal, mebbe you ain't such a fool, after all. I've wondered\\nlately  since I had time to think... But, Milt, you don't git no\\nricher.”\\n\\n“Al, I have all I want an' need.”\\n\\n“Wal, then, you don't support anybody; you don't do any good in the\\nworld.”\\n\\n“We don't agree, Al,” replied Dale, with his slow smile.\\n\\n“Reckon we never did... An' you jest come over to pay your respects to\\nme, eh?”\\n\\n“Not altogether,” answered Dale, ponderingly. “First off, I'd like to\\nsay I'll pay back them sheep you always claimed my tame cougar killed.”\\n\\n“You will! An' how'd you go about that?”\\n\\n“Wasn't very many sheep, was there?\\n\\n“A matter of fifty head.”\\n\\n“So many! Al, do you still think old Tom killed them sheep?”\\n\\n“Humph! Milt, I know damn well he did.”\\n\\n“Al, now how could you know somethin' I don't? Be reasonable, now. Let's\\ndon't fall out about this again. I'll pay back the sheep. Work it out  ”\\n\\n“Milt Dale, you'll come down here an' work out that fifty head of\\nsheep!” ejaculated the old rancher, incredulously.\\n\\n“Sure.”\\n\\n“Wal, I'll be damned!” He sat back and gazed with shrewd eyes at Dale.\\n“What's got into you, Milt? Hev you heard about my niece thet's comin',\\nan' think you'll shine up to her?”\\n\\n“Yes, Al, her comin' has a good deal to do with my deal,” replied Dale,\\nsoberly. “But I never thought to shine up to her, as you hint.”\\n\\n“Haw! Haw! You're just like all the other colts hereabouts. Reckon it's\\na good sign, too. It'll take a woman to fetch you out of the woods. But,\\nboy, this niece of mine, Helen Rayner, will stand you on your head.\\nI never seen her. They say she's jest like her mother. An' Nell\\nAuchincloss  what a girl she was!”\\n\\nDale felt his face grow red. Indeed, this was strange conversation for\\nhim.\\n\\n“Honest, Al  ” he began.\\n\\n“Son, don't lie to an old man.”\\n\\n“Lie! I wouldn't lie to any one. Al, it's only men who live in towns an'\\nare always makin' deals. I live in the forest, where there's nothin' to\\nmake me lie.”\\n\\n“Wal, no offense meant, I'm sure,” responded Auchincloss. “An' mebbe\\nthere's somethin' in what you say... We was talkin' about them sheep\\nyour big cat killed. Wal, Milt, I can't prove it, that's sure. An' mebbe\\nyou'll think me doddery when I tell you my reason. It wasn't what them\\ngreaser herders said about seein' a cougar in the herd.”\\n\\n“What was it, then?” queried Dale, much interested.\\n\\n“Wal, thet day a year ago I seen your pet. He was lyin' in front of the\\nstore an' you was inside tradin', fer supplies, I reckon. It was like\\nmeetin' an enemy face to face. Because, damn me if I didn't know that\\ncougar was guilty when he looked in my eyes! There!”\\n\\nThe old rancher expected to be laughed at. But Dale was grave.\\n\\n“Al, I know how you felt,” he replied, as if they were discussing an\\naction of a human being. “Sure I'd hate to doubt old Tom. But he's a\\ncougar. An' the ways of animals are strange... Anyway, Al, I'll make\\ngood the loss of your sheep.”\\n\\n“No, you won't,” rejoined Auchincloss, quickly. “We'll call it off. I'm\\ntakin' it square of you to make the offer. Thet's enough. So forget your\\nworry about work, if you had any.”\\n\\n“There's somethin' else, Al, I wanted to say,” began Dale, with\\nhesitation. “An' it's about Beasley.”\\n\\nAuchincloss started violently, and a flame of red shot into his face.\\nThen he raised a big hand that shook. Dale saw in a flash how the old\\nman's nerves had gone.\\n\\n“Don't mention  thet  thet greaser  to me!” burst out the rancher. “It\\nmakes me see  red... Dale, I ain't overlookin' that you spoke up fer\\nme to day  stood fer my side. Lem Harden told me. I was glad. An' thet's\\nwhy  to day  I forgot our old quarrel... But not a word about thet\\nsheep thief  or I'll drive you off the place!”\\n\\n“But, Al  be reasonable,” remonstrated Dale. “It's necessary thet I\\nspeak of  of Beasley.”\\n\\n“It ain't. Not to me. I won't listen.”\\n\\n“Reckon you'll have to, Al,” returned Dale. “Beasley's after your\\nproperty. He's made a deal  ”\\n\\n“By Heaven! I know that!” shouted Auchincloss, tottering up, with his\\nface now black red. “Do you think thet's new to me? Shut up, Dale! I\\ncan't stand it.”\\n\\n“But Al  there's worse,” went on Dale, hurriedly. “Worse! Your life's\\nthreatened  an' your niece, Helen  she's to be  ”\\n\\n“Shut up  an' clear out!” roared Auchincloss, waving his huge fists.\\n\\nHe seemed on the verge of a collapse as, shaking all over, he backed\\ninto the door. A few seconds of rage had transformed him into a pitiful\\nold man.\\n\\n“But, Al  I'm your friend  ” began Dale, appealingly.\\n\\n“Friend, hey?” returned the rancher, with grim, bitter passion. “Then\\nyou're the only one... Milt Dale, I'm rich an' I'm a dyin' man. I trust\\nnobody... But, you wild hunter  if you're my friend  prove it!... Go\\nkill thet greaser sheep thief! DO somethin'  an' then come talk to me!”\\n\\nWith that he lurched, half falling, into the house, and slammed the\\ndoor.\\n\\nDale stood there for a blank moment, and then, taking up his rifle, he\\nstrode away.\\n\\nToward sunset Dale located the camp of his four Mormon friends, and\\nreached it in time for supper.\\n\\nJohn, Roy, Joe, and Hal Beeman were sons of a pioneer Mormon who had\\nsettled the little community of Snowdrop. They were young men in years,\\nbut hard labor and hard life in the open had made them look matured.\\nOnly a year's difference in age stood between John and Roy, and between\\nRoy and Joe, and likewise Joe and Hal. When it came to appearance they\\nwere difficult to distinguish from one another. Horsemen, sheep herders,\\ncattle raisers, hunters  they all possessed long, wiry, powerful frames,\\nlean, bronzed, still faces, and the quiet, keen eyes of men used to the\\nopen.\\n\\nTheir camp was situated beside a spring in a cove surrounded by aspens,\\nsome three miles from Pine; and, though working for Beasley, near\\nthe village, they had ridden to and fro from camp, after the habit of\\nseclusion peculiar to their kind.\\n\\nDale and the brothers had much in common, and a warm regard had sprang\\nup. But their exchange of confidences had wholly concerned things\\npertaining to the forest. Dale ate supper with them, and talked as usual\\nwhen he met them, without giving any hint of the purpose forming in his\\nmind. After the meal he helped Joe round up the horses, hobble them for\\nthe night, and drive them into a grassy glade among the pines. Later,\\nwhen the shadows stole through the forest on the cool wind, and the\\ncamp fire glowed comfortably, Dale broached the subject that possessed\\nhim.\\n\\n“An' so you're working for Beasley?” he queried, by way of starting\\nconversation.\\n\\n“We was,” drawled John. “But to day, bein' the end of our month, we got\\nour pay an' quit. Beasley sure was sore.”\\n\\n“Why'd you knock off?”\\n\\nJohn essayed no reply, and his brothers all had that quiet, suppressed\\nlook of knowledge under restraint.\\n\\n“Listen to what I come to tell you, then you'll talk,” went on Dale. And\\nhurriedly he told of Beasley's plot to abduct Al Auchincloss's niece and\\nclaim the dying man's property.\\n\\nWhen Dale ended, rather breathlessly, the Mormon boys sat without any\\nshow of surprise or feeling. John, the eldest, took up a stick and\\nslowly poked the red embers of the fire, making the white sparks fly.\\n\\n“Now, Milt, why'd you tell us thet?” he asked, guardedly.\\n\\n“You're the only friends I've got,” replied Dale. “It didn't seem safe\\nfor me to talk down in the village. I thought of you boys right off. I\\nain't goin' to let Snake Anson get that girl. An' I need help, so I come\\nto you.”\\n\\n“Beasley's strong around Pine, an' old Al's weakenin'. Beasley will git\\nthe property, girl or no girl,” said John.\\n\\n“Things don't always turn out as they look. But no matter about that.\\nThe girl deal is what riled me... She's to arrive at Magdalena on\\nthe sixteenth, an' take stage for Snowdrop... Now what to do? If she\\ntravels on that stage I'll be on it, you bet. But she oughtn't to be in\\nit at all. ... Boys, somehow I'm goin' to save her. Will you help me? I\\nreckon I've been in some tight corners for you. Sure, this 's different.\\nBut are you my friends? You know now what Beasley is. An' you're all\\nlost at the hands of Snake Anson's gang. You've got fast hosses, eyes\\nfor trackin', an' you can handle a rifle. You're the kind of fellows I'd\\nwant in a tight pinch with a bad gang. Will you stand by me or see me go\\nalone?”\\n\\nThen John Beeman, silently, and with pale face, gave Dale's hand a\\npowerful grip, and one by one the other brothers rose to do likewise.\\nTheir eyes flashed with hard glint and a strange bitterness hovered\\naround their thin lips.\\n\\n“Milt, mebbe we know what Beasley is better 'n you,” said John, at\\nlength. “He ruined my father. He's cheated other Mormons. We boys have\\nproved to ourselves thet he gets the sheep Anson's gang steals... An'\\ndrives the herds to Phenix! Our people won't let us accuse Beasley. So\\nwe've suffered in silence. My father always said, let some one else say\\nthe first word against Beasley, an' you've come to us!”\\n\\nRoy Beeman put a hand on Dale's shoulder. He, perhaps, was the keenest\\nof the brothers and the one to whom adventure and peril called most.\\nHe had been oftenest with Dale, on many a long trail, and he was the\\nhardest rider and the most relentless tracker in all that range country.\\n\\n“An' we're goin' with you,” he said, in a strong and rolling voice.\\n\\nThey resumed their seats before the fire. John threw on more wood, and\\nwith a crackling and sparkling the blaze curled up, fanned by the wind.\\nAs twilight deepened into night the moan in the pines increased to a\\nroar. A pack of coyotes commenced to pierce the air in staccato cries.\\n\\nThe five young men conversed long and earnestly, considering, planning,\\nrejecting ideas advanced by each. Dale and Roy Beeman suggested most of\\nwhat became acceptable to all. Hunters of their type resembled explorers\\nin slow and deliberate attention to details. What they had to deal with\\nhere was a situation of unlimited possibilities; the horses and outfit\\nneeded; a long detour to reach Magdalena unobserved; the rescue of a\\nstrange girl who would no doubt be self willed and determined to ride\\non the stage  the rescue forcible, if necessary; the fight and the\\ninevitable pursuit; the flight into the forest, and the safe delivery of\\nthe girl to Auchincloss.\\n\\n“Then, Milt, will we go after Beasley?” queried Roy Beeman,\\nsignificantly.\\n\\nDale was silent and thoughtful.\\n\\n“Sufficient unto the day!” said John. “An' fellars, let's go to bed.”\\n\\nThey rolled out their tarpaulins, Dale sharing Roy's blankets, and soon\\nwere asleep, while the red embers slowly faded, and the great roar of\\nwind died down, and the forest stillness set in.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nHelen Rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twenty four\\nhours before she made an alarming discovery.\\n\\nAccompanied by her sister Bo, a precocious girl of sixteen, Helen had\\nleft St. Joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at\\nhome, yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life\\nin the Far West. All her people had the pioneer spirit; love of change,\\naction, adventure, was in her blood. Then duty to a widowed mother\\nwith a large and growing family had called to Helen to accept this rich\\nuncle's offer. She had taught school and also her little brothers and\\nsisters; she had helped along in other ways. And now, though the\\ntearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard, this opportunity was\\nirresistible in its call. The prayer of her dreams had been answered. To\\nbring good fortune to her family; to take care of this beautiful, wild\\nlittle sister; to leave the yellow, sordid, humdrum towns for the great,\\nrolling, boundless open; to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day\\nto be her own; to have fulfilled a deep, instinctive, and undeveloped\\nlove of horses, cattle, sheep, of desert and mountain, of trees and\\nbrooks and wild flowers  all this was the sum of her most passionate\\nlongings, now in some marvelous, fairylike way to come true.\\n\\nA check to her happy anticipations, a blank, sickening dash of cold\\nwater upon her warm and intimate dreams, had been the discovery\\nthat Harve Riggs was on the train. His presence could mean only one\\nthing  that he had followed her. Riggs had been the worst of many\\nsore trials back there in St. Joseph. He had possessed some claim or\\ninfluence upon her mother, who favored his offer of marriage to Helen;\\nhe was neither attractive, nor good, nor industrious, nor anything that\\ninterested her; he was the boastful, strutting adventurer, not genuinely\\nWestern, and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety. Helen had\\nsuspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his,\\nand also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be bad  as\\nWestern men were bad. But on the train, in the station at La Junta, one\\nglimpse of him, manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of\\nher sight, warned Helen that she now might have a problem on her hands.\\n\\nThe recognition sobered her. All was not to be a road of roses to this\\nnew home in the West. Riggs would follow her, if he could not accompany\\nher, and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything. Helen felt the\\nstartling realization of being cast upon her own resources, and then\\na numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness. But these\\nfeelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her\\ntemper. Opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to\\nit. She would not have been Al Auchincloss's niece if she had faltered.\\nAnd, when temper was succeeded by genuine anger, she could have laughed\\nto scorn this Harve Riggs and his schemes, whatever they were. Once\\nand for all she dismissed fear of him. When she left St. Joseph she had\\nfaced the West with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of\\nthat West. Homes had to be made out there in that far country, so Uncle\\nAl had written, and women were needed to make homes. She meant to be one\\nof these women and to make of her sister another. And with the thought\\nthat she would know definitely what to say to Riggs when he approached\\nher, sooner or later, Helen dismissed him from mind.\\n\\nWhile the train was in motion, enabling Helen to watch the ever changing\\nscenery, and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping Bo well in\\nhand at stations, she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests\\nand the red, rocky gullies and the dim, bold mountains. She saw the sun\\nset over distant ranges of New Mexico  a golden blaze of glory, as new\\nto her as the strange fancies born in her, thrilling and fleeting by.\\nBo's raptures were not silent, and the instant the sun sank and the\\ncolor faded she just as rapturously importuned Helen to get out the huge\\nbasket of food they had brought from home.\\n\\nThey had two seats, facing each other, at the end of the coach, and\\npiled there, with the basket on top, was luggage that constituted all\\nthe girls owned in the world. Indeed, it was very much more than they\\nhad ever owned before, because their mother, in her care for them and\\ndesire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle, had spent\\nmoney and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes.\\n\\nThe girls sat together, with the heavy basket on their knees, and ate\\nwhile they gazed out at the cool, dark ridges. The train clattered\\nslowly on, apparently over a road that was all curves. And it was\\nsupper time for everybody in that crowded coach. If Helen had not been\\nso absorbed by the great, wild mountain land she would have had more\\ninterest in the passengers. As it was she saw them, and was amused\\nand thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car, all\\nmiddle class people, poor and hopeful, traveling out there to the New\\nWest to find homes. It was splendid and beautiful, this fact, yet it\\ninspired a brief and inexplicable sadness. From the train window, that\\nworld of forest and crag, with its long bare reaches between, seemed so\\nlonely, so wild, so unlivable. How endless the distance! For hours and\\nmiles upon miles no house, no hut, no Indian tepee! It was amazing, the\\nlength and breadth of this beautiful land. And Helen, who loved brooks\\nand running streams, saw no water at all.\\n\\nThen darkness settled down over the slow moving panorama; a cool night\\nwind blew in at the window; white stars began to blink out of the blue.\\nThe sisters, with hands clasped and heads nestled together, went to\\nsleep under a heavy cloak.\\n\\n\\nEarly the next morning, while the girls were again delving into their\\napparently bottomless basket, the train stopped at Las Vegas.\\n\\n“Look! Look!” cried Bo, in thrilling voice. “Cowboys! Oh, Nell, look!”\\n\\nHelen, laughing, looked first at her sister, and thought how most of all\\nshe was good to look at. Bo was little, instinct with pulsating life,\\nand she had chestnut hair and dark blue eyes. These eyes were flashing,\\nroguish, and they drew like magnets.\\n\\nOutside on the rude station platform were railroad men, Mexicans, and\\na group of lounging cowboys. Long, lean, bow legged fellows they were,\\nwith young, frank faces and intent eyes. One of them seemed particularly\\nattractive with his superb build, his red bronze face and bright red\\nscarf, his swinging gun, and the huge, long, curved spurs. Evidently\\nhe caught Bo's admiring gaze, for, with a word to his companions, he\\nsauntered toward the window where the girls sat. His gait was singular,\\nalmost awkward, as if he was not accustomed to walking. The long spurs\\njingled musically. He removed his sombrero and stood at ease, frank,\\ncool, smiling. Helen liked him on sight, and, looking to see what effect\\nhe had upon Bo, she found that young lady staring, frightened stiff.\\n\\n“Good mawnin',” drawled the cowboy, with slow, good humored smile. “Now\\nwhere might you all be travelin'?”\\n\\nThe sound of his voice, the clean cut and droll geniality; seemed new\\nand delightful to Helen.\\n\\n“We go to Magdalena  then take stage for the White Mountains,” replied\\nHelen.\\n\\nThe cowboy's still, intent eyes showed surprise.\\n\\n“Apache country, miss,” he said. “I reckon I'm sorry. Thet's shore no\\nplace for you all... Beggin' your pawdin  you ain't Mormons?”\\n\\n“No. We're nieces of Al Auchincloss,” rejoined Helen.\\n\\n“Wal, you don't say! I've been down Magdalena way an' heerd of Al...\\nReckon you're goin' a visitin'?”\\n\\n“It's to be home for us.”\\n\\n“Shore thet's fine. The West needs girls... Yes, I've heerd of Al.\\nAn old Arizona cattle man in a sheep country! Thet's bad... Now I'm\\nwonderin'  if I'd drift down there an' ask him for a job ridin' for\\nhim  would I get it?”\\n\\nHis lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal\\nwater. The gaze he bent upon Bo somehow pleased Helen. The last year or\\ntwo, since Bo had grown prettier all the time, she had been a magnet for\\nadmiring glances. This one of the cowboy's inspired respect and liking,\\nas well as amusement. It certainly was not lost upon Bo.\\n\\n“My uncle once said in a letter that he never had enough men to run his\\nranch,” replied Helen, smiling.\\n\\n“Shore I'll go. I reckon I'd jest naturally drift that way  now.”\\n\\nHe seemed so laconic, so easy, so nice, that he could not have been\\ntaken seriously, yet Helen's quick perceptions registered a daring, a\\nsomething that was both sudden and inevitable in him. His last word was\\nas clear as the soft look he fixed upon Bo.\\n\\nHelen had a mischievous trait, which, subdue it as she would,\\noccasionally cropped out; and Bo, who once in her wilful life had been\\nrendered speechless, offered such a temptation.\\n\\n“Maybe my little sister will put in a good word for you  to Uncle Al,”\\n said Helen. Just then the train jerked, and started slowly. The cowboy\\ntook two long strides beside the car, his heated boyish face almost on a\\nlevel with the window, his eyes, now shy and a little wistful, yet bold,\\ntoo, fixed upon Bo.\\n\\n“Good by  Sweetheart!” he called.\\n\\nHe halted  was lost to view.\\n\\n“Well!” ejaculated Helen, contritely, half sorry, half amused. “What a\\nsudden young gentleman!”\\n\\nBo had blushed beautifully.\\n\\n“Nell, wasn't he glorious!” she burst out, with eyes shining.\\n\\n“I'd hardly call him that, but he was  nice,” replied Helen, much\\nrelieved that Bo had apparently not taken offense at her.\\n\\nIt appeared plain that Bo resisted a frantic desire to look out of the\\nwindow and to wave her hand. But she only peeped out, manifestly to her\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n“Do you think he  he'll come to Uncle Al's?” asked Bo.\\n\\n“Child, he was only in fun.”\\n\\n“Nell, I'll bet you he comes. Oh, it'd be great! I'm going to love\\ncowboys. They don't look like that Harve Riggs who ran after you so.”\\n\\nHelen sighed, partly because of the reminder of her odious suitor, and\\npartly because Bo's future already called mysteriously to the child.\\nHelen had to be at once a mother and a protector to a girl of intense\\nand wilful spirit.\\n\\nOne of the trainmen directed the girls' attention to a green, sloping\\nmountain rising to a bold, blunt bluff of bare rock; and, calling\\nit Starvation Peak, he told a story of how Indians had once driven\\nSpaniards up there and starved them. Bo was intensely interested, and\\nthereafter she watched more keenly than ever, and always had a question\\nfor a passing trainman. The adobe houses of the Mexicans pleased her,\\nand, then the train got out into Indian country, where pueblos appeared\\nnear the track and Indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild\\nmustangs  then she was enraptured.\\n\\n“But these Indians are peaceful!” she exclaimed once, regretfully.\\n\\n“Gracious, child! You don't want to see hostile Indians, do you?”\\n queried Helen.\\n\\n“I do, you bet,” was the frank rejoinder.\\n\\n“Well, I'LL bet that I'll be sorry I didn't leave you with mother.”\\n\\n“Nell  you never will!”\\n\\n\\nThey reached Albuquerque about noon, and this important station, where\\nthey had to change trains, had been the first dreaded anticipation of\\nthe journey. It certainly was a busy place  full of jabbering Mexicans,\\nstalking, red faced, wicked looking cowboys, lolling Indians. In the\\nconfusion Helen would have been hard put to it to preserve calmness,\\nwith Bo to watch, and all that baggage to carry, and the other train to\\nfind; but the kindly brakeman who had been attentive to them now helped\\nthem off the train into the other  a service for which Helen was very\\ngrateful.\\n\\n“Albuquerque's a hard place,” confided the trainman. “Better stay in the\\ncar  and don't hang out the windows... Good luck to you!”\\n\\nOnly a few passengers were in the car and they were Mexicans at the\\nforward end. This branch train consisted of one passenger coach, with a\\nbaggage car, attached to a string of freight cars. Helen told herself,\\nsomewhat grimly, that soon she would know surely whether or not her\\nsuspicions of Harve Riggs had warrant. If he was going on to Magdalena\\non that day he must go in this coach. Presently Bo, who was not obeying\\nadmonitions, drew her head out of the window. Her eyes were wide in\\namaze, her mouth open.\\n\\n“Nell! I saw that man Riggs!” she whispered. “He's going to get on this\\ntrain.”\\n\\n“Bo, I saw him yesterday,” replied Helen, soberly.\\n\\n“He's followed you  the  the  ”\\n\\n“Now, Bo, don't get excited,” remonstrated Helen. “We've left home now.\\nWe've got to take things as they come. Never mind if Riggs has followed\\nme. I'll settle him.”\\n\\n“Oh! Then you won't speak  have anything to do with him?”\\n\\n“I won't if I can help it.”\\n\\nOther passengers boarded the train, dusty, uncouth, ragged men, and\\nsome hard featured, poorly clad women, marked by toil, and several more\\nMexicans. With bustle and loud talk they found their several seats.\\n\\nThen Helen saw Harve Riggs enter, burdened with much luggage. He was a\\nman of about medium height, of dark, flashy appearance, cultivating long\\nblack mustache and hair. His apparel was striking, as it consisted of\\nblack frock coat, black trousers stuffed in high, fancy topped boots,\\nan embroidered vest, and flowing tie, and a black sombrero. His belt and\\ngun were prominent. It was significant that he excited comment among the\\nother passengers.\\n\\nWhen he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself,\\nand, turning abruptly, approached the seat occupied by the girls. When\\nhe reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite, took off\\nhis sombrero, and deliberately looked at Helen. His eyes were light,\\nglinting, with hard, restless quiver, and his mouth was coarse and\\narrogant. Helen had never seen him detached from her home surroundings,\\nand now the difference struck cold upon her heart.\\n\\n“Hello, Nell!” he said. “Surprised to see me?”\\n\\n“No,” she replied, coldly.\\n\\n“I'll gamble you are.”\\n\\n“Harve Riggs, I told you the day before I left home that nothing you\\ncould do or say mattered to me.”\\n\\n“Reckon that ain't so, Nell. Any woman I keep track of has reason to\\nthink. An' you know it.”\\n\\n“Then you followed me  out here?” demanded Helen, and her voice, despite\\nher control, quivered with anger.\\n\\n“I sure did,” he replied, and there was as much thought of himself in\\nthe act as there was of her.\\n\\n“Why? Why? It's useless  hopeless.”\\n\\n“I swore I'd have you, or nobody else would,” he replied, and here, in\\nthe passion of his voice there sounded egotism rather than hunger for\\na woman's love. “But I reckon I'd have struck West anyhow, sooner or\\nlater.”\\n\\n“You're not going to  all the way  to Pine?” faltered Helen, momentarily\\nweakening.\\n\\n“Nell, I'll camp on your trail from now on,” he declared.\\n\\nThen Bo sat bolt upright, with pale face and flashing eyes.\\n\\n“Harve Riggs, you leave Nell alone,” she burst out, in ringing, brave\\nyoung voice. “I'll tell you what  I'll bet  if you follow her and\\nnag her any more, my uncle Al or some cowboy will run you out of the\\ncountry.”\\n\\n“Hello, Pepper!” replied Riggs, coolly. “I see your manners haven't\\nimproved an' you're still wild about cowboys.”\\n\\n“People don't have good manners with  with  ”\\n\\n“Bo, hush!” admonished Helen. It was difficult to reprove Bo just then,\\nfor that young lady had not the slightest fear of Riggs. Indeed, she\\nlooked as if she could slap his face. And Helen realized that however\\nher intelligence had grasped the possibilities of leaving home for a\\nwild country, and whatever her determination to be brave, the actual\\nbeginning of self reliance had left her spirit weak. She would rise\\nout of that. But just now this flashing eyed little sister seemed a\\nprotector. Bo would readily adapt herself to the West, Helen thought,\\nbecause she was so young, primitive, elemental.\\n\\nWhereupon Bo turned her back to Riggs and looked out of the window. The\\nman laughed. Then he stood up and leaned over Helen.\\n\\n“Nell, I'm goin' wherever you go,” he said, steadily. “You can take that\\nfriendly or not, just as it pleases you. But if you've got any sense\\nyou'll not give these people out here a hunch against me. I might hurt\\nsomebody... An' wouldn't it be better  to act friends? For I'm goin' to\\nlook after you, whether you like it or not.”\\n\\nHelen had considered this man an annoyance, and later a menace, and now\\nshe must declare open enmity with him. However disgusting the idea that\\nhe considered himself a factor in her new life, it was the truth. He\\nexisted, he had control over his movements. She could not change that.\\nShe hated the need of thinking so much about him; and suddenly, with a\\nhot, bursting anger, she hated the man.\\n\\n“You'll not look after me. I'll take care of myself,” she said, and\\nshe turned her back upon him. She heard him mutter under his breath and\\nslowly move away down the car. Then Bo slipped a hand in hers.\\n\\n“Never mind, Nell,” she whispered. “You know what old Sheriff Haines\\nsaid about Harve Riggs. 'A four flush would be gun fighter! If he ever\\nstrikes a real Western town he'll get run out of it.' I just wish my\\nred faced cowboy had got on this train!”\\n\\nHelen felt a rush of gladness that she had yielded to Bo's wild\\nimportunities to take her West. The spirit which had made Bo\\nincorrigible at home probably would make her react happily to life out\\nin this free country. Yet Helen, with all her warmth and gratefulness,\\nhad to laugh at her sister.\\n\\n“Your red faced cowboy! Why, Bo, you were scared stiff. And now you\\nclaim him!”\\n\\n“I certainly could love that fellow,” replied Bo, dreamily.\\n\\n“Child, you've been saying that about fellows for a long time. And\\nyou've never looked twice at any of them yet.”\\n\\n“He was different... Nell, I'll bet he comes to Pine.”\\n\\n“I hope he does. I wish he was on this train. I liked his looks, Bo.”\\n\\n“Well, Nell dear, he looked at ME first and last  so don't get your\\nhopes up... Oh, the train's starting!... Good by, Albu ker  what's that\\nawful name?... Nell, let's eat dinner. I'm starved.”\\n\\nThen Helen forgot her troubles and the uncertain future, and what with\\nlistening to Bo's chatter, and partaking again of the endless good\\nthings to eat in the huge basket, and watching the noble mountains, she\\ndrew once more into happy mood.\\n\\nThe valley of the Rio Grande opened to view, wide near at hand in a\\ngreat gray green gap between the bare black mountains, narrow in the\\ndistance, where the yellow river wound away, glistening under a hot\\nsun. Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican children that\\ndarted into adobe huts as the train clattered by, and she exclaimed her\\npleasure in the Indians, and the mustangs, and particularly in a group\\nof cowboys riding into town on spirited horses. Helen saw all Bo pointed\\nout, but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung\\nlongest, and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something\\nfrom her. She had never before experienced any feeling like that; she\\nhad never seen a tenth so far. And the sight awoke something strange\\nin her. The sun was burning hot, as she could tell when she put a hand\\noutside the window, and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the\\ntrain. She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest\\nwere the sun and the dust and the wind. And her realization made her\\nlove them. It was there; the open, the wild, the beautiful, the lonely\\nland; and she felt the poignant call of blood in her  to seek, to\\nstrive, to find, to live. One look down that yellow valley, endless\\nbetween its dark iron ramparts, had given her understanding of her\\nuncle. She must be like him in spirit, as it was claimed she resembled\\nhim otherwise.\\n\\nAt length Bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life, and,\\nwith her bright head on the faded cloak, she went to sleep. But Helen\\nkept steady, farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain; and\\nduring the long hours, as she watched through clouds of dust and veils\\nof heat, some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to\\nchange and then to fix. It was her physical acceptance  her eyes and her\\nsenses taking the West as she had already taken it in spirit.\\n\\nA woman should love her home wherever fate placed her, Helen believed,\\nand not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living. How\\ncould life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous\\nvastness of bare earth and open sky, where the need to achieve made\\nthinking and pondering superficial?\\n\\nIt was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the Rio\\nGrande, and then of its paralleled mountain ranges. But the miles\\nbrought compensation in other valleys, other bold, black upheavals of\\nrock, and then again bare, boundless yellow plains, and sparsely cedared\\nridges, and white dry washes, ghastly in the sunlight, and dazzling\\nbeds of alkali, and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers\\nbloomed.\\n\\nShe noted, too, that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had\\nbegun to shade to red  and this she knew meant an approach to\\nArizona. Arizona, the wild, the lonely, the red desert, the green\\nplateau  Arizona with its thundering rivers, its unknown spaces, its\\npasture lands and timber lands, its wild horses, cowboys, outlaws,\\nwolves and lions and savages! As to a boy, that name stirred and\\nthrilled and sang to her of nameless, sweet, intangible things,\\nmysterious and all of adventure. But she, being a girl of twenty, who\\nhad accepted responsibilities, must conceal the depths of her heart and\\nthat which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being\\nborn a boy.\\n\\nTime passed, while Helen watched and learned and dreamed. The train\\nstopped, at long intervals, at wayside stations where there seemed\\nnothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans, and dust and heat. Bo awoke\\nand began to chatter, and to dig into the basket. She learned from the\\nconductor that Magdalena was only two stations on. And she was full of\\nconjectures as to who would meet them, what would happen. So Helen was\\ndrawn back to sober realities, in which there was considerable zest.\\nAssuredly she did not know what was going to happen. Twice Riggs passed\\nup and down the aisle, his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile\\ndeliberately forced upon her sight. But again Helen fought a growing\\ndread with contemptuous scorn. This fellow was not half a man. It was\\nnot conceivable what he could do, except annoy her, until she arrived\\nat Pine. Her uncle was to meet her or send for her at Snowdrop, which\\nplace, Helen knew, was distant a good long ride by stage from Magdalena.\\nThis stage ride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey, in\\nHelen's considerations.\\n\\n“Oh, Nell!” cried Bo, with delight. “We're nearly there! Next station,\\nthe conductor said.”\\n\\n“I wonder if the stage travels at night,” said Helen, thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Sure it does!” replied the irrepressible Bo.\\n\\nThe train, though it clattered along as usual, seemed to Helen to fly.\\nThere the sun was setting over bleak New Mexican bluffs, Magdalena was\\nat hand, and night, and adventure. Helen's heart beat fast. She\\nwatched the yellow plains where the cattle grazed; their presence, and\\nirrigation ditches and cottonwood trees told her that the railroad part\\nof the journey was nearly ended. Then, at Bo's little scream, she\\nlooked across the car and out of the window to see a line of low, flat,\\nred adobe houses. The train began to slow down. Helen saw children run,\\nwhite children and Mexican together; then more houses, and high upon a\\nhill an immense adobe church, crude and glaring, yet somehow beautiful.\\n\\nHelen told Bo to put on her bonnet, and, performing a like office for\\nherself, she was ashamed of the trembling of her fingers. There were\\nbustle and talk in the car.\\n\\nThe train stopped. Helen peered out to see a straggling crowd of\\nMexicans and Indians, all motionless and stolid, as if trains or nothing\\nelse mattered. Next Helen saw a white man, and that was a relief. He\\nstood out in front of the others. Tall and broad, somehow striking, he\\ndrew a second glance that showed him to be a hunter clad in gray fringed\\nbuckskin, and carrying a rifle.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nHere, there was no kindly brakeman to help the sisters with their\\nluggage. Helen bade Bo take her share; thus burdened, they made an\\nawkward and laborious shift to get off the train.\\n\\nUpon the platform of the car a strong hand seized Helen's heavy bag,\\nwith which she was straining, and a loud voice called out:\\n\\n“Girls, we're here  sure out in the wild an' woolly West!”\\n\\nThe speaker was Riggs, and he had possessed himself of part of her\\nbaggage with action and speech meant more to impress the curious\\ncrowd than to be really kind. In the excitement of arriving Helen\\nhad forgotten him. The manner of sudden reminder  the insincerity of\\nit  made her temper flash. She almost fell, encumbered as she was, in\\nher hurry to descend the steps. She saw the tall hunter in gray step\\nforward close to her as she reached for the bag Riggs held.\\n\\n“Mr. Riggs, I'll carry my bag,” she said.\\n\\n“Let me lug this. You help Bo with hers,” he replied, familiarly.\\n\\n“But I want it,” she rejoined, quietly, with sharp determination. No\\nlittle force was needed to pull the bag away from Riggs.\\n\\n“See here, Helen, you ain't goin' any farther with that joke, are you?”\\n he queried, deprecatingly, and he still spoke quite loud.\\n\\n“It's no joke to me,” replied Helen. “I told you I didn't want your\\nattention.”\\n\\n“Sure. But that was temper. I'm your friend  from your home town. An' I\\nain't goin' to let a quarrel keep me from lookin' after you till you're\\nsafe at your uncle's.”\\n\\nHelen turned her back upon him. The tall hunter had just helped Bo off\\nthe car. Then Helen looked up into a smooth bronzed face and piercing\\ngray eyes.\\n\\n“Are you Helen Rayner?” he asked.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“My name's Dale. I've come to meet you.”\\n\\n“Ah! My uncle sent you?” added Helen, in quick relief.\\n\\n“No; I can't say Al sent me,” began the man, “but I reckon  ”\\n\\nHe was interrupted by Riggs, who, grasping Helen by the arm, pulled her\\nback a step.\\n\\n“Say, mister, did Auchincloss send you to meet my young friends here?”\\n he demanded, arrogantly.\\n\\nDale's glance turned from Helen to Riggs. She could not read this quiet\\ngray gaze, but it thrilled her.\\n\\n“No. I come on my own hook,” he answered.\\n\\n“You'll understand, then  they're in my charge,” added Riggs.\\n\\nThis time the steady light gray eyes met Helen's, and if there was not a\\nsmile in them or behind them she was still further baffled.\\n\\n“Helen, I reckon you said you didn't want this fellow's attention.”\\n\\n“I certainly said that,” replied Helen, quickly. Just then Bo slipped\\nclose to her and gave her arm a little squeeze. Probably Bo's thought\\nwas like hers  here was a real Western man. That was her first\\nimpression, and following swiftly upon it was a sensation of eased\\nnerves.\\n\\nRiggs swaggered closer to Dale.\\n\\n“Say, Buckskin, I hail from Texas  ”\\n\\n“You're wastin' our time an' we've need to hurry,” interrupted Dale. His\\ntone seemed friendly. “An' if you ever lived long in Texas you wouldn't\\npester a lady an' you sure wouldn't talk like you do.”\\n\\n“What!” shouted Riggs, hotly. He dropped his right hand significantly to\\nhis hip.\\n\\n“Don't throw your gun. It might go off,” said Dale.\\n\\nWhatever Riggs's intention had been  and it was probably just what Dale\\nevidently had read it  he now flushed an angry red and jerked at his\\ngun.\\n\\nDale's hand flashed too swiftly for Helen's eye to follow it. But she\\nheard the thud as it struck. The gun went flying to the platform and\\nscattered a group of Indians and Mexicans.\\n\\n“You'll hurt yourself some day,” said Dale.\\n\\nHelen had never heard a slow, cool voice like this hunter's. Without\\nexcitement or emotion or hurry, it yet seemed full and significant of\\nthings the words did not mean. Bo uttered a strange little exultant cry.\\n\\nRiggs's arm had dropped limp. No doubt it was numb. He stared, and his\\npredominating expression was surprise. As the shuffling crowd began to\\nsnicker and whisper, Riggs gave Dale a malignant glance, shifted it to\\nHelen, and then lurched away in the direction of his gun.\\n\\nDale did not pay any more attention to him. Gathering up Helen's\\nbaggage, he said, “Come on,” and shouldered a lane through the gaping\\ncrowd. The girls followed close at his heels.\\n\\n“Nell! what 'd I tell you?” whispered Bo. “Oh, you're all atremble!”\\n\\nHelen was aware of her unsteadiness; anger and fear and relief in quick\\nsuccession had left her rather weak. Once through the motley crowd\\nof loungers, she saw an old gray stage coach and four lean horses. A\\ngrizzled, sunburned man sat on the driver's seat, whip and reins in\\nhand. Beside him was a younger man with rifle across his knees. Another\\nman, young, tall, lean, dark, stood holding the coach door open. He\\ntouched his sombrero to the girls. His eyes were sharp as he addressed\\nDale.\\n\\n“Milt, wasn't you held up?”\\n\\n“No. But some long haired galoot was tryin' to hold up the girls.\\nWanted to throw his gun on me. I was sure scared,” replied Dale, as he\\ndeposited the luggage.\\n\\nBo laughed. Her eyes, resting upon Dale, were warm and bright. The\\nyoung man at the coach door took a second look at her, and then a smile\\nchanged the dark hardness of his face.\\n\\nDale helped the girls up the high step into the stage, and then, placing\\nthe lighter luggage, in with them, he threw the heavier pieces on top.\\n\\n“Joe, climb up,” he said.\\n\\n“Wal, Milt,” drawled the driver, “let's ooze along.”\\n\\nDale hesitated, with his hand on the door. He glanced at the crowd, now\\nedging close again, and then at Helen.\\n\\n“I reckon I ought to tell you,” he said, and indecision appeared to\\nconcern him.\\n\\n“What?” exclaimed Helen.\\n\\n“Bad news. But talkin' takes time. An' we mustn't lose any.”\\n\\n“There's need of hurry?” queried Helen, sitting up sharply.\\n\\n“I reckon.”\\n\\n“Is this the stage to Snowdrop?\\n\\n“No. That leaves in the mornin'. We rustled this old trap to get a start\\nto night.”\\n\\n“The sooner the better. But I  I don't understand,” said Helen,\\nbewildered.\\n\\n“It'll not be safe for you to ride on the mornin' stage,” returned Dale.\\n\\n“Safe! Oh, what do you mean?” exclaimed Helen. Apprehensively she gazed\\nat him and then back at Bo.\\n\\n“Explainin' will take time. An' facts may change your mind. But if you\\ncan't trust me  ”\\n\\n“Trust you!” interposed Helen, blankly. “You mean to take us to\\nSnowdrop?”\\n\\n“I reckon we'd better go roundabout an' not hit Snowdrop,” he replied,\\nshortly.\\n\\n“Then to Pine  to my uncle  Al Auchincloss?\\n\\n“Yes, I'm goin' to try hard.”\\n\\nHelen caught her breath. She divined that some peril menaced her. She\\nlooked steadily, with all a woman's keenness, into this man's face. The\\nmoment was one of the fateful decisions she knew the West had in store\\nfor her. Her future and that of Bo's were now to be dependent upon her\\njudgments. It was a hard moment and, though she shivered inwardly, she\\nwelcomed the initial and inevitable step. This man Dale, by his dress of\\nbuckskin, must be either scout or hunter. His size, his action, the tone\\nof his voice had been reassuring. But Helen must decide from what she\\nsaw in his face whether or not to trust him. And that face was\\nclear bronze, unlined, unshadowed, like a tranquil mask, clean cut,\\nstrong jawed, with eyes of wonderful transparent gray.\\n\\n“Yes, I'll trust you,” she said. “Get in, and let us hurry. Then you can\\nexplain.”\\n\\n“All ready, Bill. Send 'em along,” called Dale.\\n\\nHe had to stoop to enter the stage, and, once in, he appeared to fill\\nthat side upon which he sat. Then the driver cracked his whip; the\\nstage lurched and began to roll; the motley crowd was left behind. Helen\\nawakened to the reality, as she saw Bo staring with big eyes at the\\nhunter, that a stranger adventure than she had ever dreamed of had began\\nwith the rattling roll of that old stage coach.\\n\\nDale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward, holding his rifle between\\nhis knees. The light shone better upon his features now that he was\\nbareheaded. Helen had never seen a face like that, which at first glance\\nappeared darkly bronzed and hard, and then became clear, cold, aloof,\\nstill, intense. She wished she might see a smile upon it. And now that\\nthe die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it. There was\\nsingular force in it, but she did not recognize what kind of force. One\\ninstant she thought it was stern, and the next that it was sweet, and\\nagain that it was neither.\\n\\n“I'm glad you've got your sister,” he said, presently.\\n\\n“How did you know she's my sister?”\\n\\n“I reckon she looks like you.”\\n\\n“No one else ever thought so,” replied Helen, trying to smile.\\n\\nBo had no difficulty in smiling, as she said, “Wish I was half as pretty\\nas Nell.”\\n\\n“Nell. Isn't your name Helen?” queried Dale.\\n\\n“Yes. But my  some few call me Nell.”\\n\\n“I like Nell better than Helen. An' what's yours?” went on Dale, looking\\nat Bo.\\n\\n“Mine's Bo. Just plain B o. Isn't it silly? But I wasn't asked when they\\ngave it to me,” she replied.\\n\\n“Bo. It's nice an' short. Never heard it before. But I haven't met many\\npeople for years.”\\n\\n“Oh! we've left the town!” cried Bo. “Look, Nell! How bare! It's just\\nlike desert.”\\n\\n“It is desert. We've forty miles of that before we come to a hill or a\\ntree.”\\n\\nHelen glanced out. A flat, dull green expanse waved away from the road\\non and on to a bright, dark horizon line, where the sun was setting\\nrayless in a clear sky. Open, desolate, and lonely, the scene gave her a\\ncold thrill.\\n\\n“Did your uncle Al ever write anythin' about a man named Beasley?” asked\\nDale.\\n\\n“Indeed he did,” replied Helen, with a start of surprise. “Beasley! That\\nname is familiar to us  and detestable. My uncle complained of this man\\nfor years. Then he grew bitter  accused Beasley. But the last year or so\\nnot a word!”\\n\\n“Well, now,” began the hunter, earnestly, “let's get the bad news over.\\nI'm sorry you must be worried. But you must learn to take the West as it\\nis. There's good an' bad, maybe more bad. That's because the country's\\nyoung... So to come right out with it  this Beasley hired a gang of\\noutlaws to meet the stage you was goin' in to Snowdrop  to morrow  an'\\nto make off with you.”\\n\\n“Make off with me?” ejaculated Helen, bewildered.\\n\\n“Kidnap you! Which, in that gang, would be worse than killing you!”\\n declared Dale, grimly, and he closed a huge fist on his knee.\\n\\nHelen was utterly astounded.\\n\\n“How hor rible!” she gasped out. “Make off with me!... What in Heaven's\\nname for?”\\n\\nBo gave vent to a fierce little utterance.\\n\\n“For reasons you ought to guess,” replied Dale, and he leaned forward\\nagain. Neither his voice nor face changed in the least, but yet there\\nwas a something about him that fascinated Helen. “I'm a hunter. I live\\nin the woods. A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm\\nan' I took to an old log cabin. Soon as I got there I heard horses.\\nI hid up in the loft. Some men rode up an' come in. It was dark. They\\ncouldn't see me. An' they talked. It turned out they were Snake Anson\\nan' his gang of sheep thieves. They expected to meet Beasley there.\\nPretty soon he came. He told Anson how old Al, your uncle, was on his\\nlast legs  how he had sent for you to have his property when he died.\\nBeasley swore he had claims on Al. An' he made a deal with Anson to get\\nyou out of the way. He named the day you were to reach Magdalena. With\\nAl dead an' you not there, Beasley could get the property. An' then he\\nwouldn't care if you did come to claim it. It 'd be too late... Well,\\nthey rode away that night. An' next day I rustled down to Pine. They're\\nall my friends at Pine, except old Al. But they think I'm queer. I\\ndidn't want to confide in many people. Beasley is strong in Pine, an'\\nfor that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides\\nBeasley. So I went to see your uncle. He never had any use for me\\nbecause he thought I was lazy like an Indian. Old Al hates lazy men.\\nThen we fell out  or he fell out  because he believed a tame lion of\\nmine had killed some of his sheep. An' now I reckon that Tom might have\\ndone it. I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasley's about you, but\\nold Al wouldn't listen. He's cross  very cross. An' when I tried to tell\\nhim, why, he went right out of his head. Sent me off the ranch. Now I\\nreckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in. Finally I went to four\\nfriends I could trust. They're Mormon boys  brothers. That's Joe out\\non top, with the driver. I told them all about Beasley's deal an' asked\\nthem to help me. So we planned to beat Anson an' his gang to Magdalena.\\nIt happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine.\\nAn' we had to go careful. But the boys had a couple of friends\\nhere  Mormons, too, who agreed to help us. They had this old stage...\\nAn' here you are.” Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at\\nHelen and then at Bo.\\n\\n“You're perfectly splendid!” cried Bo, ringingly. She was white; her\\nfingers were clenched; her eyes blazed.\\n\\nDale appeared startled out of his gravity, and surprised, then pleased.\\nA smile made his face like a boy's. Helen felt her body all rigid, yet\\nslightly trembling. Her hands were cold. The horror of this revelation\\nheld her speechless. But in her heart she echoed Bo's exclamation of\\nadmiration and gratitude.\\n\\n“So far, then,” resumed Dale, with a heavy breath of relief. “No wonder\\nyou're upset. I've a blunt way of talkin'... Now we've thirty miles to\\nride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off. To day sometime the\\nrest of the boys  Roy, John, an' Hal  were to leave Show Down, which's\\na town farther on from Snowdrop. They have my horses an' packs besides\\ntheir own. Somewhere on the road we'll meet them  to night, maybe  or\\ntomorrow. I hope not to night, because that 'd mean Anson's gang was\\nridin' in to Magdalena.”\\n\\nHelen wrung her hands helplessly.\\n\\n“Oh, have I no courage?” she whispered.\\n\\n“Nell, I'm as scared as you are,” said Bo, consolingly, embracing her\\nsister.\\n\\n“I reckon that's natural,” said Dale, as if excusing them. “But, scared\\nor not, you both brace up. It's a bad job. But I've done my best. An'\\nyou'll be safer with me an' the Beeman boys than you'd be in Magdalena,\\nor anywhere else, except your uncle's.”\\n\\n“Mr.  Mr. Dale,” faltered Helen, with her tears falling, “don't think me\\na coward  or  or ungrateful. I'm neither. It's only I'm so  so shocked.\\nAfter all we hoped and expected  this  this  is such a  a terrible\\nsurprise.”\\n\\n“Never mind, Nell dear. Let's take what comes,” murmured Bo.\\n\\n“That's the talk,” said Dale. “You see, I've come right out with the\\nworst. Maybe we'll get through easy. When we meet the boys we'll take to\\nthe horses an' the trails. Can you ride?”\\n\\n“Bo has been used to horses all her life and I ride fairly well,”\\n responded Helen. The idea of riding quickened her spirit.\\n\\n“Good! We may have some hard ridin' before I get you up to Pine. Hello!\\nWhat's that?”\\n\\nAbove the creaking, rattling, rolling roar of the stage Helen heard a\\nrapid beat of hoofs. A horse flashed by, galloping hard.\\n\\nDale opened the door and peered out. The stage rolled to a halt. He\\nstepped down and gazed ahead.\\n\\n“Joe, who was that?” he queried.\\n\\n“Nary me. An' Bill didn't know him, either,” replied Joe. “I seen him\\n'way back. He was ridin' some. An' he slowed up goin' past us. Now he's\\nrunnin' again.”\\n\\nDale shook his head as if he did not like the circumstances.\\n\\n“Milt, he'll never get by Roy on this road,” said Joe.\\n\\n“Maybe he'll get by before Roy strikes in on the road.”\\n\\n“It ain't likely.”\\n\\nHelen could not restrain her fears. “Mr. Dale, you think he was a\\nmessenger  going ahead to post that  that Anson gang?”\\n\\n“He might be,” replied Dale, simply.\\n\\nThen the young man called Joe leaned out from the seat above and called:\\n“Miss Helen, don't you worry. Thet fellar is more liable to stop lead\\nthan anythin' else.”\\n\\nHis words, meant to be kind and reassuring, were almost as sinister to\\nHelen as the menace to her own life. Long had she known how cheap life\\nwas held in the West, but she had only known it abstractly, and she had\\nnever let the fact remain before her consciousness. This cheerful young\\nman spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf. The thought it roused\\nwas tragic  for bloodshed was insupportable to her  and then the thrills\\nwhich followed were so new, strange, bold, and tingling that they were\\nrevolting. Helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths, of instincts at\\nwhich she was amazed and ashamed.\\n\\n“Joe, hand down that basket of grub  the small one with the canteen,”\\n said Dale, reaching out a long arm. Presently he placed a cloth covered\\nbasket inside the stage. “Girls, eat all you want an' then some.”\\n\\n“We have a basket half full yet,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“You'll need it all before we get to Pine... Now, I'll ride up on top\\nwith the boys an' eat my supper. It'll be dark, presently, an' we'll\\nstop often to listen. But don't be scared.”\\n\\nWith that he took his rifle and, closing the door, clambered up to the\\ndriver's seat. Then the stage lurched again and began to roll along.\\n\\nNot the least thing to wonder at of this eventful evening was the way Bo\\nreached for the basket of food. Helen simply stared at her.\\n\\n“Bo, you CAN'T EAT!” she exclaimed.\\n\\n“I should smile I can,” replied that practical young lady. “And you're\\ngoing to if I have to stuff things in your mouth. Where's your wits,\\nNell? He said we must eat. That means our strength is going to have some\\npretty severe trials... Gee! it's all great  just like a story! The\\nunexpected  why, he looks like a prince turned hunter!  long, dark,\\nstage journey  held up  fight  escape  wild ride on horses  woods\\nand camps and wild places  pursued  hidden in the forest  more hard\\nrides  then safe at the ranch. And of course he falls madly in love with\\nme  no, you, for I'll be true to my Las Vegas lover  ”\\n\\n“Hush, silly! Bo, tell me, aren't you SCARED?”\\n\\n“Scared! I'm scared stiff. But if Western girls stand such things, we\\ncan. No Western girl is going to beat ME!”\\n\\nThat brought Helen to a realization of the brave place she had given\\nherself in dreams, and she was at once ashamed of herself and wildly\\nproud of this little sister.\\n\\n“Bo, thank Heaven I brought you with me!” exclaimed Helen, fervently.\\n“I'll eat if it chokes me.”\\n\\nWhereupon she found herself actually hungry, and while she ate she\\nglanced out of the stage, first from one side and then from the other.\\nThese windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in.\\nThe sun had long since sunk. Out to the west, where a bold, black\\nhorizon line swept away endlessly, the sky was clear gold, shading\\nto yellow and blue above. Stars were out, pale and wan, but growing\\nbrighter. The earth appeared bare and heaving, like a calm sea. The wind\\nbore a fragrance new to Helen, acridly sweet and clean, and it was so\\ncold it made her fingers numb.\\n\\n“I heard some animal yelp,” said Bo, suddenly, and she listened with\\nhead poised.\\n\\nBut Helen heard nothing save the steady clip clop of hoofs, the clink of\\nchains, the creak and rattle of the old stage, and occasionally the low\\nvoices of the men above.\\n\\nWhen the girls had satisfied hunger and thirst, night had settled down\\nblack. They pulled the cloaks up over them, and close together leaned\\nback in a corner of the seat and talked in whispers. Helen did not have\\nmuch to say, but Bo was talkative.\\n\\n“This beats me!” she said once, after an interval. “Where are we, Nell?\\nThose men up there are Mormons. Maybe they are abducting us!”\\n\\n“Mr. Dale isn't a Mormon,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“How do you know?”\\n\\n“I could tell by the way he spoke of his friends.”\\n\\n“Well, I wish it wasn't so dark. I'm not afraid of men in daylight...\\nNell, did you ever see such a wonderful looking fellow? What'd they call\\nhim? Milt  Milt Dale. He said he lived in the woods. If I hadn't fallen\\nin love with that cowboy who called me  well, I'd be a goner now.”\\n\\nAfter an interval of silence Bo whispered, startlingly, “Wonder if Harve\\nRiggs is following us now?”\\n\\n“Of course he is,” replied Helen, hopelessly.\\n\\n“He'd better look out. Why, Nell, he never saw  he never  what did Uncle\\nAl used to call it?  sav  savvied  that's it. Riggs never savvied that\\nhunter. But I did, you bet.”\\n\\n“Savvied! What do you mean, Bo?”\\n\\n“I mean that long haired galoot never saw his real danger. But I felt\\nit. Something went light inside me. Dale never took him seriously at\\nall.”\\n\\n“Riggs will turn up at Uncle Al's, sure as I'm born,” said Helen.\\n\\n“Let him turn,” replied Bo, contemptuously. “Nell, don't you ever bother\\nyour head again about him. I'll bet they're all men out here. And I\\nwouldn't be in Harve Riggs's boots for a lot.”\\n\\nAfter that Bo talked of her uncle and his fatal illness, and from that\\nshe drifted back to the loved ones at home, now seemingly at the other\\nside of the world, and then she broke down and cried, after which she\\nfell asleep on Helen's shoulder.\\n\\nBut Helen could not have fallen asleep if she had wanted to.\\n\\nShe had always, since she could remember, longed for a moving, active\\nlife; and for want of a better idea she had chosen to dream of gipsies.\\nAnd now it struck her grimly that, if these first few hours of her\\nadvent in the West were forecasts of the future, she was destined to\\nhave her longings more than fulfilled.\\n\\nPresently the stage rolled slower and slower, until it came to a halt.\\nThen the horses heaved, the harnesses clinked, the men whispered.\\nOtherwise there was an intense quiet. She looked out, expecting to\\nfind it pitch dark. It was black, yet a transparent blackness. To her\\nsurprise she could see a long way. A shooting star electrified her.\\nThe men were listening. She listened, too, but beyond the slight sounds\\nabout the stage she heard nothing. Presently the driver clucked to his\\nhorses, and travel was resumed.\\n\\nFor a while the stage rolled on rapidly, evidently downhill, swaying\\nfrom side to side, and rattling as if about to fall to pieces. Then it\\nslowed on a level, and again it halted for a few moments, and once more\\nin motion it began a laborsome climb. Helen imagined miles had been\\ncovered. The desert appeared to heave into billows, growing rougher, and\\ndark, round bushes dimly stood out. The road grew uneven and rocky, and\\nwhen the stage began another descent its violent rocking jolted Bo out\\nof her sleep and in fact almost out of Helen's arms.\\n\\n“Where am I?” asked Bo, dazedly.\\n\\n“Bo, you're having your heart's desire, but I can't tell you where you\\nare,” replied Helen.\\n\\nBo awakened thoroughly, which fact was now no wonder, considering the\\njostling of the old stage.\\n\\n“Hold on to me, Nell!... Is it a runaway?”\\n\\n“We've come about a thousand miles like this, I think,” replied Helen.\\n“I've not a whole bone in my body.”\\n\\nBo peered out of the window.\\n\\n“Oh, how dark and lonesome! But it'd be nice if it wasn't so cold. I'm\\nfreezing.”\\n\\n“I thought you loved cold air,” taunted Helen.\\n\\n“Say, Nell, you begin to talk like yourself,” responded Bo.\\n\\nIt was difficult to hold on to the stage and each other and the cloak\\nall at once, but they succeeded, except in the roughest places, when\\nfrom time to time they were bounced around. Bo sustained a sharp rap on\\nthe head.\\n\\n“Oooooo!” she moaned. “Nell Rayner, I'll never forgive you for fetching\\nme on this awful trip.”\\n\\n“Just think of your handsome Las Vegas cowboy,” replied Helen.\\n\\nEither this remark subdued Bo or the suggestion sufficed to reconcile\\nher to the hardships of the ride.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as they talked and maintained silence and tried to sleep, the\\ndriver of the stage kept at his task after the manner of Western men who\\nknew how to get the best out of horses and bad roads and distance.\\n\\nBy and by the stage halted again and remained at a standstill for so\\nlong, with the men whispering on top, that Helen and Bo were roused to\\napprehension.\\n\\nSuddenly a sharp whistle came from the darkness ahead.\\n\\n“Thet's Roy,” said Joe Beeman, in a low voice.\\n\\n“I reckon. An' meetin' us so quick looks bad,” replied Dale. “Drive on,\\nBill.”\\n\\n“Mebbe it seems quick to you,” muttered the driver, “but if we hain't\\ncome thirty mile, an' if thet ridge thar hain't your turnin' off place,\\nwhy, I don't know nothin'.”\\n\\nThe stage rolled on a little farther, while Helen and Bo sat clasping\\neach other tight, wondering with bated breath what was to be the next\\nthing to happen.\\n\\nThen once more they were at a standstill. Helen heard the thud of boots\\nstriking the ground, and the snorts of horses.\\n\\n“Nell, I see horses,” whispered Bo, excitedly. “There, to the side of\\nthe road... and here comes a man... Oh, if he shouldn't be the one\\nthey're expecting!”\\n\\nHelen peered out to see a tall, dark form, moving silently, and beyond\\nit a vague outline of horses, and then pale gleams of what must have\\nbeen pack loads.\\n\\nDale loomed up, and met the stranger in the road.\\n\\n“Howdy, Milt? You got the girl sure, or you wouldn't be here,” said a\\nlow voice.\\n\\n“Roy, I've got two girls  sisters,” replied Dale.\\n\\nThe man Roy whistled softly under his breath. Then another lean, rangy\\nform strode out of the darkness, and was met by Dale.\\n\\n“Now, boys  how about Anson's gang?” queried Dale.\\n\\n“At Snowdrop, drinkin' an' quarrelin'. Reckon they'll leave there about\\ndaybreak,” replied Roy.\\n\\n“How long have you been here?”\\n\\n“Mebbe a couple of hours.”\\n\\n“Any horse go by?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Roy, a strange rider passed us before dark. He was hittin' the road.\\nAn' he's got by here before you came.”\\n\\n“I don't like thet news,” replied Roy, tersely. “Let's rustle. With\\ngirls on hossback you'll need all the start you can get. Hey, John?”\\n\\n“Snake Anson shore can foller hoss tracks,” replied the third man.\\n\\n“Milt, say the word,” went on Roy, as he looked up at the stars.\\n“Daylight not far away. Here's the forks of the road, an' your hosses,\\nan' our outfit. You can be in the pines by sunup.”\\n\\nIn the silence that ensued Helen heard the throb of her heart and\\nthe panting little breaths of her sister. They both peered out, hands\\nclenched together, watching and listening in strained attention.\\n\\n“It's possible that rider last night wasn't a messenger to Anson,” said\\nDale. “In that case Anson won't make anythin' of our wheel tracks or\\nhorse tracks. He'll go right on to meet the regular stage. Bill, can you\\ngo back an' meet the stage comin' before Anson does?”\\n\\n“Wal, I reckon so  an' take it easy at thet,” replied Bill.\\n\\n“All right,” continued Dale, instantly. “John, you an' Joe an' Hal ride\\nback to meet the regular stage. An' when you meet it get on an' be on it\\nwhen Anson holds it up.”\\n\\n“Thet's shore agreeable to me,” drawled John.\\n\\n“I'd like to be on it, too,” said Roy, grimly.\\n\\n“No. I'll need you till I'm safe in the woods. Bill, hand down the bags.\\nAn' you, Roy, help me pack them. Did you get all the supplies I wanted?”\\n\\n“Shore did. If the young ladies ain't powerful particular you can feed\\nthem well for a couple of months.”\\n\\nDale wheeled and, striding to the stage, he opened the door.\\n\\n“Girls, you're not asleep? Come,” he called.\\n\\nBo stepped down first.\\n\\n“I was asleep till this  this vehicle fell off the road back a ways,”\\n she replied.\\n\\nRoy Beeman's low laugh was significant. He took off his sombrero and\\nstood silent. The old driver smothered a loud guffaw.\\n\\n“Veehicle! Wal, I'll be doggoned! Joe, did you hear thet? All the spunky\\ngurls ain't born out West.”\\n\\nAs Helen followed with cloak and bag Roy assisted her, and she\\nencountered keen eyes upon her face. He seemed both gentle and\\nrespectful, and she felt his solicitude. His heavy gun, swinging low,\\nstruck her as she stepped down.\\n\\nDale reached into the stage and hauled out baskets and bags. These he\\nset down on the ground.\\n\\n“Turn around, Bill, an' go along with you. John an' Hal will follow\\npresently,” ordered Dale.\\n\\n“Wal, gurls,” said Bill, looking down upon them, “I was shore powerful\\nglad to meet you all. An' I'm ashamed of my country  offerin' two sich\\npurty gurls insults an' low down tricks. But shore you'll go through\\nsafe now. You couldn't be in better company fer ridin' or huntin' or\\nmarryin' or gittin' religion  ”\\n\\n“Shut up, you old grizzly!” broke in Dale, sharply.\\n\\n“Haw! Haw! Good by, gurls, an' good luck!” ended Bill, as he began to\\nwhip the reins.\\n\\nBo said good by quite distinctly, but Helen could only murmur hers. The\\nold driver seemed a friend.\\n\\nThen the horses wheeled and stamped, the stage careened and creaked,\\npresently to roll out of sight in the gloom.\\n\\n“You're shiverin',” said Dale, suddenly, looking down upon Helen. She\\nfelt his big, hard hand clasp hers. “Cold as ice!”\\n\\n“I am c cold,” replied Helen. “I guess we're not warmly dressed.”\\n\\n“Nell, we roasted all day, and now we're freezing,” declared Bo. “I\\ndidn't know it was winter at night out here.”\\n\\n“Miss, haven't you some warm gloves an' a coat?” asked Roy, anxiously.\\n“It 'ain't begun to get cold yet.”\\n\\n“Nell, we've heavy gloves, riding suits and boots  all fine and new  in\\nthis black bag,” said Bo, enthusiastically kicking a bag at her feet.\\n\\n“Yes, so we have. But a lot of good they'll do us, to night,” returned\\nHelen.\\n\\n“Miss, you'd do well to change right here,” said Roy, earnestly. “It'll\\nsave time in the long run an' a lot of sufferin' before sunup.”\\n\\nHelen stared at the young man, absolutely amazed with his simplicity.\\nShe was advised to change her traveling dress for a riding suit  out\\nsomewhere in a cold, windy desert  in the middle of the night  among\\nstrange young men!\\n\\n“Bo, which bag is it?” asked Dale, as if she were his sister. And when\\nshe indicated the one, he picked it up. “Come off the road.”\\n\\nBo followed him, and Helen found herself mechanically at their heels.\\nDale led them a few paces off the road behind some low bushes.\\n\\n“Hurry an' change here,” he said. “We'll make a pack of your outfit an'\\nleave room for this bag.”\\n\\nThen he stalked away and in a few strides disappeared.\\n\\nBo sat down to begin unlacing her shoes. Helen could just see her pale,\\npretty face and big, gleaming eyes by the light of the stars. It struck\\nher then that Bo was going to make eminently more of a success of\\nWestern life than she was.\\n\\n“Nell, those fellows are n nice,” said Bo, reflectively. “Aren't you\\nc cold? Say, he said hurry!”\\n\\nIt was beyond Helen's comprehension how she ever began to disrobe out\\nthere in that open, windy desert, but after she had gotten launched on\\nthe task she found that it required more fortitude than courage. The\\ncold wind pierced right through her. Almost she could have laughed at\\nthe way Bo made things fly.\\n\\n“G g g gee!” chattered Bo. “I n never w was so c c cold in all my life.\\nNell Rayner, m may the g good Lord forgive y you!”\\n\\nHelen was too intent on her own troubles to take breath to talk. She was\\na strong, healthy girl, swift and efficient with her hands, yet this,\\nthe hardest physical ordeal she had ever experienced, almost overcame\\nher. Bo outdistanced her by moments, helped her with buttons, and laced\\none whole boot for her. Then, with hands that stung, Helen packed the\\ntraveling suits in the bag.\\n\\n“There! But what an awful mess!” exclaimed Helen. “Oh, Bo, our pretty\\ntraveling dresses!”\\n\\n“We'll press them t to morrow  on a l log,” replied Bo, and she giggled.\\n\\nThey started for the road. Bo, strange to note, did not carry her share\\nof the burden, and she seemed unsteady on her feet.\\n\\nThe men were waiting beside a group of horses, one of which carried a\\npack.\\n\\n“Nothin' slow about you,” said Dale, relieving Helen of the grip. “Roy,\\nput them up while I sling on this bag.”\\n\\nRoy led out two of the horses.\\n\\n“Get up,” he said, indicating Bo. “The stirrups are short on this\\nsaddle.”\\n\\nBo was an adept at mounting, but she made such awkward and slow work of\\nit in this instance that Helen could not believe her eyes.\\n\\n“Haw 're the stirrups?” asked Roy. “Stand in them. Guess they're about\\nright... Careful now! Thet hoss is skittish. Hold him in.”\\n\\nBo was not living up to the reputation with which Helen had credited\\nher.\\n\\n“Now, miss, you get up,” said Roy to Helen. And in another instant she\\nfound herself astride a black, spirited horse. Numb with cold as she\\nwas, she yet felt the coursing thrills along her veins.\\n\\nRoy was at the stirrups with swift hands.\\n\\n“You're taller 'n I guessed,” he said. “Stay up, but lift your foot...\\nShore now, I'm glad you have them thick, soft boots. Mebbe we'll ride\\nall over the White Mountains.”\\n\\n“Bo, do you hear that?” called Helen.\\n\\nBut Bo did not answer. She was leaning rather unnaturally in her saddle.\\nHelen became anxious. Just then Dale strode back to them.\\n\\n“All cinched up, Roy?”\\n\\n“Jest ready,” replied Roy.\\n\\nThen Dale stood beside Helen. How tall he was! His wide shoulders seemed\\non a level with the pommel of her saddle. He put an affectionate hand on\\nthe horse.\\n\\n“His name's Ranger an' he's the fastest an' finest horse in this\\ncountry.”\\n\\n“I reckon he shore is  along with my bay,” corroborated Roy.\\n\\n“Roy, if you rode Ranger he'd beat your pet,” said Dale. “We can start\\nnow. Roy, you drive the pack horses.”\\n\\nHe took another look at Helen's saddle and then moved to do likewise\\nwith Bo's.\\n\\n“Are you  all right?” he asked, quickly.\\n\\nBo reeled in her seat.\\n\\n“I'm n near froze,” she replied, in a faint voice. Her face shone white\\nin the starlight. Helen recognized that Bo was more than cold.\\n\\n“Oh, Bo!” she called, in distress.\\n\\n“Nell, don't you worry, now.”\\n\\n“Let me carry you,” suggested Dale.\\n\\n“No. I'll s s stick on this horse or d die,” fiercely retorted Bo.\\n\\nThe two men looked up at her white face and then at each other. Then Roy\\nwalked away toward the dark bunch of horses off the road and Dale swung\\nastride the one horse left.\\n\\n“Keep close to me,” he said.\\n\\nBo fell in line and Helen brought up the rear.\\n\\nHelen imagined she was near the end of a dream. Presently she would\\nawaken with a start and see the pale walls of her little room at\\nhome, and hear the cherry branches brushing her window, and the old\\nclarion voiced cock proclaim the hour of dawn.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nThe horses trotted. And the exercise soon warmed Helen, until she was\\nfairly comfortable except in her fingers. In mind, however, she grew\\nmore miserable as she more fully realized her situation. The night now\\nbecame so dark that, although the head of her horse was alongside the\\nflank of Bo's, she could scarcely see Bo. From time to time Helen's\\nanxious query brought from her sister the answer that she was all right.\\n\\nHelen had not ridden a horse for more than a year, and for several\\nyears she had not ridden with any regularity. Despite her thrills\\nupon mounting, she had entertained misgivings. But she was agreeably\\nsurprised, for the horse, Ranger, had an easy gait, and she found she\\nhad not forgotten how to ride. Bo, having been used to riding on a farm\\nnear home, might be expected to acquit herself admirably. It occurred\\nto Helen what a plight they would have been in but for the thick,\\ncomfortable riding outfits.\\n\\nDark as the night was, Helen could dimly make out the road underneath.\\nIt was rocky, and apparently little used. When Dale turned off the road\\ninto the low brush or sage of what seemed a level plain, the traveling\\nwas harder, rougher, and yet no slower. The horses kept to the gait of\\nthe leaders. Helen, discovering it unnecessary, ceased attempting to\\nguide Ranger. There were dim shapes in the gloom ahead, and always they\\ngave Helen uneasiness, until closer approach proved them to be rocks\\nor low, scrubby trees. These increased in both size and number as the\\nhorses progressed. Often Helen looked back into the gloom behind.\\nThis act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread. Dale\\nexpected to be pursued. And Helen experienced, along with the dread,\\nflashes of unfamiliar resentment. Not only was there an attempt afoot\\nto rob her of her heritage, but even her personal liberty. Then she\\nshuddered at the significance of Dale's words regarding her possible\\nabduction by this hired gang. It seemed monstrous, impossible. Yet,\\nmanifestly it was true enough to Dale and his allies. The West, then, in\\nreality was raw, hard, inevitable.\\n\\nSuddenly her horse stopped. He had come up alongside Bo's horse. Dale\\nhad halted ahead, and apparently was listening. Roy and the pack train\\nwere out of sight in the gloom.\\n\\n“What is it?” whispered Helen.\\n\\n“Reckon I heard a wolf,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Was that cry a wolf's?” asked Bo. “I heard. It was wild.”\\n\\n“We're gettin' up close to the foot hills,” said Dale. “Feel how much\\ncolder the air is.”\\n\\n“I'm warm now,” replied Bo. “I guess being near froze was what ailed\\nme... Nell, how 're you?”\\n\\n“I'm warm, too, but  ” Helen answered.\\n\\n“If you had your choice of being here or back home, snug in bed  which\\nwould you take?” asked Bo.\\n\\n“Bo!” exclaimed Helen, aghast.\\n\\n“Well, I'd choose to be right here on this horse,” rejoined Bo.\\n\\nDale heard her, for he turned an instant, then slapped his horse and\\nstarted on.\\n\\nHelen now rode beside Bo, and for a long time they climbed steadily in\\nsilence. Helen knew when that dark hour before dawn had passed, and she\\nwelcomed an almost imperceptible lightening in the east. Then the stars\\npaled. Gradually a grayness absorbed all but the larger stars. The\\ngreat white morning star, wonderful as Helen had never seen it, lost its\\nbrilliance and life and seemed to retreat into the dimming blue.\\n\\nDaylight came gradually, so that the gray desert became distinguishable\\nby degrees. Rolling bare hills, half obscured by the gray lifting mantle\\nof night, rose in the foreground, and behind was gray space, slowly\\ntaking form and substance. In the east there was a kindling of pale\\nrose and silver that lengthened and brightened along a horizon growing\\nvisibly rugged.\\n\\n“Reckon we'd better catch up with Roy,” said Dale, and he spurred his\\nhorse.\\n\\nRanger and Bo's mount needed no other urging, and they swung into a\\ncanter. Far ahead the pack animals showed with Roy driving them. The\\ncold wind was so keen in Helen's face that tears blurred her eyes and\\nfroze her cheeks. And riding Ranger at that pace was like riding in\\na rocking chair. That ride, invigorating and exciting, seemed all too\\nshort.\\n\\n“Oh, Nell, I don't care  what becomes of  me!” exclaimed Bo,\\nbreathlessly.\\n\\nHer face was white and red, fresh as a rose, her eyes glanced darkly\\nblue, her hair blew out in bright, unruly strands. Helen knew she felt\\nsome of the physical stimulation that had so roused Bo, and seemed so\\nirresistible, but somber thought was not deflected thereby.\\n\\nIt was clear daylight when Roy led off round a knoll from which patches\\nof scrubby trees  cedars, Dale called them  straggled up on the side of\\nthe foot hills.\\n\\n“They grow on the north slopes, where the snow stays longest,” said\\nDale.\\n\\nThey descended into a valley that looked shallow, but proved to be deep\\nand wide, and then began to climb another foot hill. Upon surmounting it\\nHelen saw the rising sun, and so glorious a view confronted her that she\\nwas unable to answer Bo's wild exclamations.\\n\\nBare, yellow, cedar dotted slopes, apparently level, so gradual was the\\nascent, stretched away to a dense ragged line of forest that rose\\nblack over range after range, at last to fail near the bare summit of a\\nmagnificent mountain, sunrise flushed against the blue sky.\\n\\n“Oh, beautiful!” cried Bo. “But they ought to be called Black\\nMountains.”\\n\\n“Old Baldy, there, is white half the year,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Look back an' see what you say,” suggested Roy.\\n\\nThe girls turned to gaze silently. Helen imagined she looked down upon\\nthe whole wide world. How vastly different was the desert! Verily it\\nyawned away from her, red and gold near at hand, growing softly flushed\\nwith purple far away, a barren void, borderless and immense, where\\ndark green patches and black lines and upheaved ridges only served to\\nemphasize distance and space.\\n\\n“See thet little green spot,” said Roy, pointing. “Thet's Snowdrop. An'\\nthe other one  'way to the right  thet's Show Down.”\\n\\n“Where is Pine?” queried Helen, eagerly.\\n\\n“Farther still, up over the foot hills at the edge of the woods.”\\n\\n“Then we're riding away from it.”\\n\\n“Yes. If we'd gone straight for Pine thet gang could overtake us. Pine\\nis four days' ride. An' by takin' to the mountains Milt can hide his\\ntracks. An' when he's thrown Anson off the scent, then he'll circle down\\nto Pine.”\\n\\n“Mr. Dale, do you think you'll get us there safely  and soon?” asked\\nHelen, wistfully.\\n\\n“I won't promise soon, but I promise safe. An' I don't like bein' called\\nMister,” he replied.\\n\\n“Are we ever going to eat?” inquired Bo, demurely.\\n\\nAt this query Roy Beeman turned with a laugh to look at Bo. Helen saw\\nhis face fully in the light, and it was thin and hard, darkly bronzed,\\nwith eyes like those of a hawk, and with square chin and lean jaws\\nshowing scant, light beard.\\n\\n“We shore are,” he replied. “Soon as we reach the timber. Thet won't be\\nlong.”\\n\\n“Reckon we can rustle some an' then take a good rest,” said Dale, and he\\nurged his horse into a jog trot.\\n\\nDuring a steady trot for a long hour, Helen's roving eyes were\\neverywhere, taking note of the things from near to far  the scant sage\\nthat soon gave place to as scanty a grass, and the dark blots that\\nproved to be dwarf cedars, and the ravines opening out as if by magic\\nfrom what had appeared level ground, to wind away widening between gray\\nstone walls, and farther on, patches of lonely pine trees, two and three\\ntogether, and then a straggling clump of yellow aspens, and up beyond\\nthe fringed border of forest, growing nearer all the while, the black\\nsweeping benches rising to the noble dome of the dominant mountain of\\nthe range.\\n\\nNo birds or animals were seen in that long ride up toward the timber,\\nwhich fact seemed strange to Helen. The air lost something of its cold,\\ncutting edge as the sun rose higher, and it gained sweeter tang of\\nforest land. The first faint suggestion of that fragrance was utterly\\nnew to Helen, yet it brought a vague sensation of familiarity and\\nwith it an emotion as strange. It was as if she had smelled that keen,\\npungent tang long ago, and her physical sense caught it before her\\nmemory.\\n\\nThe yellow plain had only appeared to be level. Roy led down into a\\nshallow ravine, where a tiny stream meandered, and he followed this\\naround to the left, coming at length to a point where cedars and\\ndwarf pines formed a little grove. Here, as the others rode up, he sat\\ncross legged in his saddle, and waited.\\n\\n“We'll hang up awhile,” he said. “Reckon you're tired?”\\n\\n“I'm hungry, but not tired yet,” replied Bo.\\n\\nHelen dismounted, to find that walking was something she had apparently\\nlost the power to do. Bo laughed at her, but she, too, was awkward when\\nonce more upon the ground.\\n\\nThen Roy got down. Helen was surprised to find him lame. He caught her\\nquick glance.\\n\\n“A hoss threw me once an' rolled on me. Only broke my collar bone, five\\nribs, one arm, an' my bow legs in two places!”\\n\\nNotwithstanding this evidence that he was a cripple, as he stood there\\ntall and lithe in his homespun, ragged garments, he looked singularly\\npowerful and capable.\\n\\n“Reckon walkin' around would be good for you girls,” advised Dale. “If\\nyou ain't stiff yet, you'll be soon. An' walkin' will help. Don't go\\nfar. I'll call when breakfast's ready.”\\n\\n\\nA little while later the girls were whistled in from their walk and\\nfound camp fire and meal awaiting them. Roy was sitting cross legged,\\nlike an Indian, in front of a tarpaulin, upon which was spread a homely\\nbut substantial fare. Helen's quick eye detected a cleanliness and\\nthoroughness she had scarcely expected to find in the camp cooking of\\nmen of the wilds. Moreover, the fare was good. She ate heartily, and\\nas for Bo's appetite, she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as\\namused at it. The young men were all eyes, assiduous in their service\\nto the girls, but speaking seldom. It was not lost upon Helen how\\nDale's gray gaze went often down across the open country. She divined\\napprehension from it rather than saw much expression in it.\\n\\n“I  declare,” burst out Bo, when she could not eat any more, “this\\nisn't believable. I'm dreaming... Nell, the black horse you rode is the\\nprettiest I ever saw.”\\n\\nRanger, with the other animals, was grazing along the little brook.\\nPacks and saddles had been removed. The men ate leisurely. There\\nwas little evidence of hurried flight. Yet Helen could not cast off\\nuneasiness. Roy might have been deep, and careless, with a motive to\\nspare the girls' anxiety, but Dale seemed incapable of anything he did\\nnot absolutely mean.\\n\\n“Rest or walk,” he advised the girls. “We've got forty miles to ride\\nbefore dark.”\\n\\nHelen preferred to rest, but Bo walked about, petting the horses and\\nprying into the packs. She was curious and eager.\\n\\nDale and Roy talked in low tones while they cleaned up the utensils and\\npacked them away in a heavy canvas bag.\\n\\n“You really expect Anson 'll strike my trail this mornin'?” Dale was\\nasking.\\n\\n“I shore do,” replied Roy.\\n\\n“An' how do you figure that so soon?”\\n\\n“How'd you figure it  if you was Snake Anson?” queried Roy, in reply.\\n\\n“Depends on that rider from Magdalena,” Said Dale, soberly. “Although\\nit's likely I'd seen them wheel tracks an' hoss tracks made where we\\nturned off. But supposin' he does.”\\n\\n“Milt, listen. I told you Snake met us boys face to face day before\\nyesterday in Show Down. An' he was plumb curious.”\\n\\n“But he missed seein' or hearin' about me,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Mebbe he did an' mebbe he didn't. Anyway, what's the difference whether\\nhe finds out this mornin' or this evenin'?”\\n\\n“Then you ain't expectin' a fight if Anson holds up the stage?”\\n\\n“Wal, he'd have to shoot first, which ain't likely. John an' Hal, since\\nthet shootin' scrape a year ago, have been sort of gun shy. Joe might\\nget riled. But I reckon the best we can be shore of is a delay. An' it'd\\nbe sense not to count on thet.”\\n\\n“Then you hang up here an' keep watch for Anson's gang  say long enough\\nso's to be sure they'd be in sight if they find our tracks this mornin'.\\nMakin' sure one way or another, you ride 'cross country to Big Spring,\\nwhere I'll camp to night.”\\n\\nRoy nodded approval of that suggestion. Then without more words both men\\npicked up ropes and went after the horses. Helen was watching Dale, so\\nthat when Bo cried out in great excitement Helen turned to see a savage\\nyellow little mustang standing straight up on his hind legs and pawing\\nthe air. Roy had roped him and was now dragging him into camp.\\n\\n“Nell, look at that for a wild pony!” exclaimed Bo.\\n\\nHelen busied herself getting well out of the way of the infuriated\\nmustang. Roy dragged him to a cedar near by.\\n\\n“Come now, Buckskin,” said Roy, soothingly, and he slowly approached the\\nquivering animal. He went closer, hand over hand, on the lasso. Buckskin\\nshowed the whites of his eyes and also his white teeth. But he stood\\nwhile Roy loosened the loop and, slipping it down over his head,\\nfastened it in a complicated knot round his nose.\\n\\n“Thet's a hackamore,” he said, indicating the knot. “He's never had a\\nbridle, an' never will have one, I reckon.”\\n\\n“You don't ride him?” queried Helen.\\n\\n“Sometimes I do,” replied Roy, with a smile. “Would you girls like to\\ntry him?”\\n\\n“Excuse me,” answered Helen.\\n\\n“Gee!” ejaculated Bo. “He looks like a devil. But I'd tackle him  if you\\nthink I could.”\\n\\nThe wild leaven of the West had found quick root in Bo Rayner.\\n\\n“Wal, I'm sorry, but I reckon I'll not let you  for a spell,” replied\\nRoy, dryly.\\n\\n“He pitches somethin' powerful bad.”\\n\\n“Pitches. You mean bucks?”\\n\\n“I reckon.”\\n\\nIn the next half hour Helen saw more and learned more about how horses\\nof the open range were handled than she had ever heard of. Excepting\\nRanger, and Roy's bay, and the white pony Bo rode, the rest of the\\nhorses had actually to be roped and hauled into camp to be saddled and\\npacked. It was a job for fearless, strong men, and one that called for\\npatience as well as arms of iron. So that for Helen Rayner the thing\\nsucceeding the confidence she had placed in these men was respect. To an\\nobserving woman that half hour told much.\\n\\nWhen all was in readiness for a start Dale mounted, and said,\\nsignificantly: “Roy, I'll look for you about sundown. I hope no sooner.”\\n\\n“Wal, it'd be bad if I had to rustle along soon with bad news. Let's\\nhope for the best. We've been shore lucky so far. Now you take to the\\npine mats in the woods an' hide your trail.”\\n\\nDale turned away. Then the girls bade Roy good by, and followed. Soon\\nRoy and his buckskin colored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of\\ntrees.\\n\\nThe unhampered horses led the way; the pack animals trotted after them;\\nthe riders were close behind. All traveled at a jog trot. And this gait\\nmade the packs bob up and down and from side to side. The sun felt\\nwarm at Helen's back and the wind lost its frosty coldness, that almost\\nappeared damp, for a dry, sweet fragrance. Dale drove up the shallow\\nvalley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of\\ntimber some few miles ahead. It did not take long to reach the edge of\\nthe forest.\\n\\nHelen wondered why the big pines grew so far on that plain and no\\nfarther. Probably the growth had to do with snow, but, as the ground\\nwas level, she could not see why the edge of the woods should come just\\nthere.\\n\\nThey rode into the forest.\\n\\nTo Helen it seemed a strange, critical entrance into another world,\\nwhich she was destined to know and to love. The pines were big,\\nbrown barked, seamed, and knotted, with no typical conformation except\\na majesty and beauty. They grew far apart. Few small pines and little\\nunderbrush flourished beneath them. The floor of this forest appeared\\nremarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and\\nwide brown areas of pine needles. These manifestly were what Roy\\nhad meant by pine mats. Here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or\\nrotting. Helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and\\nthe strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all, and when\\nthey did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log. Likewise\\nshe became aware of a springy nature of the ground. And then she saw\\nthat the pine mats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the\\nhorses, and after they had passed sprang back to place again, leaving no\\ntrack. Helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind. Indeed,\\nit would take a sharp eye to follow Dale through that forest. This\\nknowledge was infinitely comforting to Helen, and for the first time\\nsince the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind\\nand heart. It left her free for some of the appreciation she might have\\nhad in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances.\\n\\nBo, however, seemed too young, too wild, too intense to mind what the\\ncircumstances were. She responded to reality. Helen began to suspect\\nthat the girl would welcome any adventure, and Helen knew surely now\\nthat Bo was a true Auchincloss. For three long days Helen had felt a\\nconstraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar; for the last\\nhours it had been submerged under dread. But it must be, she concluded,\\nblood like her sister's, pounding at her veins to be set free to race\\nand to burn.\\n\\nBo loved action. She had an eye for beauty, but she was not\\ncontemplative. She was now helping Dale drive the horses and hold them\\nin rather close formation. She rode well, and as yet showed no symptoms\\nof fatigue or pain. Helen began to be aware of both, but not enough yet\\nto limit her interest.\\n\\nA wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her. Of all living\\ncreatures in nature Helen liked birds best, and she knew many and could\\nimitate the songs of a few. But here under the stately pines there were\\nno birds. Squirrels, however, began to be seen here and there, and in\\nthe course of an hour's travel became abundant. The only one with which\\nshe was familiar was the chipmunk. All the others, from the slim bright\\nblacks to the striped russets and the white tailed grays, were totally\\nnew to her. They appeared tame and curious. The reds barked and scolded\\nat the passing cavalcade; the blacks glided to some safe branch, there\\nto watch; the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their\\ndomain.\\n\\nOnce Dale, halting his horse, pointed with long arm, and Helen,\\nfollowing the direction, descried several gray deer standing in a glade,\\nmotionless, with long ears up. They made a wild and beautiful picture.\\nSuddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides.\\n\\nThe forest on the whole held to the level, open character, but there\\nwere swales and stream beds breaking up its regular conformity. Toward\\nnoon, however, it gradually changed, a fact that Helen believed she\\nmight have observed sooner had she been more keen. The general lay of\\nthe land began to ascend, and the trees to grow denser.\\n\\nShe made another discovery. Ever since she had entered the forest she\\nhad become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting\\nher nostrils. She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But\\npresently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine\\nodor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch.\\nThe smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength.\\nAlso her throat and lungs seemed to burn.\\n\\nWhen she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings\\nit was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied\\nrecognition. Thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they\\ngrew worse. One, especially, was a pain beyond all her experience.\\nIt lay in the muscles of her side, above her hip, and it grew to be a\\ntreacherous thing, for it was not persistent. It came and went. After it\\ndid come, with a terrible flash, it could be borne by shifting or easing\\nthe body. But it gave no warning. When she expected it she was mistaken;\\nwhen she dared to breathe again, then, with piercing swiftness,\\nit returned like a blade in her side. This, then, was one of the\\nriding pains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride. It\\nwas almost too much to be borne. The beauty of the forest, the living\\ncreatures to be seen scurrying away, the time, distance  everything\\nfaded before that stablike pain. To her infinite relief she found that\\nit was the trot that caused this torture. When Ranger walked she did not\\nhave to suffer it. Therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared\\nor until Dale and Bo were almost out of sight; then she loped him ahead\\nuntil he had caught up.\\n\\nSo the hours passed, the sun got around low, sending golden shafts\\nunder the trees, and the forest gradually changed to a brighter, but a\\nthicker, color. This slowly darkened. Sunset was not far away.\\n\\nShe heard the horses splashing in water, and soon she rode up to see the\\ntiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss.\\nShe crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a\\nmore open place in the forest where the pines were huge, towering,\\nand far apart. A low, gray bluff of stone rose to the right, perhaps\\none third as high as the trees. From somewhere came the rushing sound of\\nrunning water.\\n\\n“Big Spring,” announced Dale. “We camp here. You girls have done well.”\\n\\nAnother glance proved to Helen that all those little streams poured from\\nunder this gray bluff.\\n\\n“I'm dying for a drink,” cried Bo with her customary hyperbole.\\n\\n“I reckon you'll never forget your first drink here,” remarked Dale.\\n\\nBo essayed to dismount, and finally fell off, and when she did get to\\nthe ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function, and she\\nfell flat. Dale helped her up.\\n\\n“What's wrong with me, anyhow?” she demanded, in great amaze.\\n\\n“Just stiff, I reckon,” replied Dale, as he led her a few awkward steps.\\n\\n“Bo, have you any hurts?” queried Helen, who still sat her horse, loath\\nto try dismounting, yet wanting to beyond all words.\\n\\nBo gave her an eloquent glance.\\n\\n“Nell, did you have one in your side, like a wicked, long\\ndarning needle, punching deep when you weren't ready?”\\n\\n“That one I'll never get over!” exclaimed Helen, softly. Then, profiting\\nby Bo's experience, she dismounted cautiously, and managed to keep\\nupright. Her legs felt like wooden things.\\n\\nPresently the girls went toward the spring.\\n\\n“Drink slow,” called out Dale.\\n\\nBig Spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray, weathered\\nbluff, from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water.\\nIts fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold\\nstone.\\n\\nHelen and Bo lay flat on a mossy bank, seeing their faces as they bent\\nover, and they sipped a mouthful, by Dale's advice, and because they\\nwere so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a\\nprecious opportunity.\\n\\nThe water was so cold that it sent a shock over Helen, made her teeth\\nache, and a singular, revivifying current steal all through her,\\nwonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh, irresistible\\nin its appeal to thirst. Helen raised her head to look at this water. It\\nwas colorless as she had found it tasteless.\\n\\n“Nell  drink!” panted Bo. “Think of our  old spring  in the\\norchard  full of pollywogs!”\\n\\nAnd then Helen drank thirstily, with closed eyes, while a memory of home\\nstirred from Bo's gift of poignant speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nThe first camp duty Dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the\\nhorses, and, opening it, he took out tarpaulin and blankets, which he\\narranged on the ground under a pine tree.\\n\\n“You girls rest,” he said, briefly.\\n\\n“Can't we help?” asked Helen, though she could scarcely stand.\\n\\n“You'll be welcome to do all you like after you're broke in.”\\n\\n“Broke in!” ejaculated Bo, with a little laugh. “I'm all broke UP now.”\\n\\n“Bo, it looks as if Mr. Dale expects us to have quite a stay with him in\\nthe woods.”\\n\\n“It does,” replied Bo, as slowly she sat down upon the blankets,\\nstretched out with a long sigh, and laid her head on a saddle. “Nell,\\ndidn't he say not to call him Mister?”\\n\\nDale was throwing the packs off the other horses.\\n\\nHelen lay down beside Bo, and then for once in her life she experienced\\nthe sweetness of rest.\\n\\n“Well, sister, what do you intend to call him?” queried Helen,\\ncuriously.\\n\\n“Milt, of course,” replied Bo.\\n\\nHelen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches.\\n\\n“I suppose, then, when your Las Vegas cowboy comes along you will call\\nhim what he called you.”\\n\\nBo blushed, which was a rather unusual thing for her.\\n\\n“I will if I like,” she retorted. “Nell, ever since I could remember\\nyou've raved about the West. Now you're OUT West, right in it good and\\ndeep. So wake up!”\\n\\nThat was Bo's blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination\\nof Helen's superficialities. It sank deep. Helen had no retort. Her\\nambition, as far as the West was concerned, had most assuredly not been\\nfor such a wild, unheard of jaunt as this. But possibly the West  a\\nliving from day to day  was one succession of adventures, trials,\\ntests, troubles, and achievements. To make a place for others to live\\ncomfortably some day! That might be Bo's meaning, embodied in her\\nforceful hint. But Helen was too tired to think it out then. She found\\nit interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch Dale.\\n\\nHe hobbled the horses and turned them loose. Then with ax in hand he\\napproached a short, dead tree, standing among a few white barked\\naspens. Dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax. With his coat off,\\ndisplaying his wide shoulders, straight back, and long, powerful arms,\\nhe looked a young giant. He was lithe and supple, brawny but not bulky.\\nThe ax rang on the hard wood, reverberating through the forest. A few\\nstrokes sufficed to bring down the stub. Then he split it up. Helen was\\ncurious to see how he kindled a fire. First he ripped splinters out of\\nthe heart of the log, and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground.\\nThen from a saddlebag which hung on a near by branch he took flint and\\nsteel and a piece of what Helen supposed was rag or buckskin, upon\\nwhich powder had been rubbed. At any rate, the first strike of the steel\\nbrought sparks, a blaze, and burning splinters. Instantly the flame\\nleaped a foot high. He put on larger pieces of wood crosswise, and the\\nfire roared.\\n\\nThat done, he stood erect, and, facing the north, he listened. Helen\\nremembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before\\nsince the arrival at Big Spring. It was Roy for whom he was listening\\nand watching. The sun had set and across the open space the tips of the\\npines were losing their brightness.\\n\\nThe camp utensils, which the hunter emptied out of a sack, gave forth a\\njangle of iron and tin. Next he unrolled a large pack, the contents\\nof which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes. These evidently\\ncontained food supplies. The bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over\\nit, pack and all. Dale filled it at the spring. Upon returning to the\\ncamp fire he poured water into a washbasin, and, getting down to his\\nknees, proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly. The act seemed a habit,\\nfor Helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods\\nand listened. Then he dried his hands over the fire, and, turning to the\\nspread out pack, he began preparations for the meal.\\n\\nSuddenly Helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied.\\nAt Magdalena, on the stage ride, and last night, she had trusted\\nthis stranger, a hunter of the White Mountains, who appeared ready to\\nbefriend her. And she had felt an exceeding gratitude. Still, she had\\nlooked at him impersonally. But it began to dawn upon her that chance\\nhad thrown her in the company of a remarkable man. That impression\\nbaffled her. It did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind\\nto help a young woman in peril, or that he appeared deft and quick at\\ncamp fire chores. Most Western men were brave, her uncle had told her,\\nand many were roughly kind, and all of them could cook. This hunter was\\nphysically a wonderful specimen of manhood, with something leonine about\\nhis stature. But that did not give rise to her impression. Helen\\nhad been a school teacher and used to boys, and she sensed a boyish\\nsimplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter. She believed, however,\\nthat it was a mental and spiritual force in Dale which had drawn her to\\nthink of it.\\n\\n“Nell, I've spoken to you three times,” protested Bo, petulantly. “What\\n're you mooning over?”\\n\\n“I'm pretty tired  and far away, Bo,” replied Helen. “What did you say?”\\n\\n“I said I had an e normous appetite.”\\n\\n“Really. That's not remarkable for you. I'm too tired to eat. And afraid\\nto shut my eyes. They'd never come open. When did we sleep last, Bo?”\\n\\n“Second night before we left home,” declared Bo.\\n\\n“Four nights! Oh, we've slept some.”\\n\\n“I'll bet I make mine up in this woods. Do you suppose we'll sleep right\\nhere  under this tree  with no covering?”\\n\\n“It looks so,” replied Helen, dubiously.\\n\\n“How perfectly lovely!” exclaimed Bo, in delight. “We'll see the stars\\nthrough the pines.”\\n\\n“Seems to be clouding over. Wouldn't it be awful if we had a storm?”\\n\\n“Why, I don't know,” answered Bo, thoughtfully. “It must storm out\\nWest.”\\n\\nAgain Helen felt a quality of inevitableness in Bo. It was something\\nthat had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St. Joseph.\\nAll of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thought  a thrilling\\nconsciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop in a new and wild\\nenvironment. How strange, and fearful, perhaps, to watch that growth!\\nBo, being younger, more impressionable, with elemental rather than\\nintellectual instincts, would grow stronger more swiftly. Helen wondered\\nif she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive. But how could\\nanyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way? It was the\\nsavage who did not think.\\n\\nHelen saw Dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest.\\n\\n“Reckon Roy ain't comin',” he soliloquized. “An' that's good.” Then he\\nturned to the girls. “Supper's ready.”\\n\\nThe girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity. And\\nthey ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods. Dale\\nattended them with a pleasant light upon his still face.\\n\\n“To morrow night we'll have meat,” he said.\\n\\n“What kind?” asked Bo.\\n\\n“Wild turkey or deer. Maybe both, if you like. But it's well to take\\nwild meat slow. An' turkey  that 'll melt in your mouth.”\\n\\n“Uummm!” murmured Bo, greedily. “I've heard of wild turkey.”\\n\\nWhen they had finished Dale ate his meal, listening to the talk of the\\ngirls, and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bo's. It was\\ntwilight when he began to wash the pots and pans, and almost dark by the\\ntime his duties appeared ended. Then he replenished the campfire and\\nsat down on a log to gaze into the fire. The girls leaned comfortably\\npropped against the saddles.\\n\\n“Nell, I'll keel over in a minute,” said Bo. “And I oughtn't  right on\\nsuch a big supper.”\\n\\n“I don't see how I can sleep, and I know I can't stay awake,” rejoined\\nHelen.\\n\\nDale lifted his head alertly.\\n\\n“Listen.”\\n\\nThe girls grew tense and still. Helen could not hear a sound, unless it\\nwas a low thud of hoof out in the gloom. The forest seemed sleeping. She\\nknew from Bo's eyes, wide and shining in the camp fire light, that she,\\ntoo, had failed to catch whatever it was Dale meant.\\n\\n“Bunch of coyotes comin',” he explained.\\n\\nSuddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy, high strung, strange\\nbarks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or\\ninquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at the\\nedge of the circle of light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded\\nthe camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a\\nrestless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after\\nthe chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes\\nwent away.\\n\\nSilence again settled down. If it had not been for the anxiety always\\npresent in Helen's mind she would have thought this silence sweet and\\nunfamiliarly beautiful.\\n\\n“Ah! Listen to that fellow,” spoke up Dale. His voice was thrilling.\\n\\nAgain the girls strained their ears. That was not necessary, for\\npresently, clear and cold out of the silence, pealed a mournful howl,\\nlong drawn, strange and full and wild.\\n\\n“Oh! What's that?” whispered Bo.\\n\\n“That's a big gray wolf  a timber wolf, or lofer, as he's sometimes\\ncalled,” replied Dale. “He's high on some rocky ridge back there. He\\nscents us, an' he doesn't like it... There he goes again. Listen! Ah,\\nhe's hungry.”\\n\\nWhile Helen listened to this exceedingly wild cry  so wild that it made\\nher flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come\\nover her  she kept her glance upon Dale.\\n\\n“You love him?” she murmured involuntarily, quite without understanding\\nthe motive of her query.\\n\\nAssuredly Dale had never had that question asked of him before, and\\nit seemed to Helen, as he pondered, that he had never even asked it of\\nhimself.\\n\\n“I reckon so,” he replied, presently.\\n\\n“But wolves kill deer, and little fawns, and everything helpless in the\\nforest,” expostulated Bo.\\n\\nThe hunter nodded his head.\\n\\n“Why, then, can you love him?” repeated Helen.\\n\\n“Come to think of it, I reckon it's because of lots of reasons,”\\n returned Dale. “He kills clean. He eats no carrion. He's no coward. He\\nfights. He dies game... An' he likes to be alone.”\\n\\n“Kills clean. What do you mean by that?”\\n\\n“A cougar, now, he mangles a deer. An' a silvertip, when killin' a\\ncow or colt, he makes a mess of it. But a wolf kills clean, with sharp\\nsnaps.”\\n\\n“What are a cougar and a silvertip?”\\n\\n“Cougar means mountain lion or panther, an' a silvertip is a grizzly\\nbear.”\\n\\n“Oh, they're all cruel!” exclaimed Helen, shrinking.\\n\\n“I reckon. Often I've shot wolves for relayin' a deer.”\\n\\n“What's that?”\\n\\n“Sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer, an' while one of them\\nrests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner, who'll, take\\nup the chase. That way they run the deer down. Cruel it is, but nature,\\nan' no worse than snow an' ice that starve deer, or a fox that kills\\nturkey chicks breakin' out of the egg, or ravens that pick the eyes out\\nof new born lambs an' wait till they die. An' for that matter, men are\\ncrueler than beasts of prey, for men add to nature, an' have more than\\ninstincts.”\\n\\nHelen was silenced, as well as shocked. She had not only learned a new\\nand striking viewpoint in natural history, but a clear intimation to the\\nreason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in\\nthis man. A hunter was one who killed animals for their fur, for their\\nmeat or horns, or for some lust for blood  that was Helen's definition\\nof a hunter, and she believed it was held by the majority of people\\nliving in settled states. But the majority might be wrong. A hunter\\nmight be vastly different, and vastly more than a tracker and slayer\\nof game. The mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men.\\nPerhaps Dale knew its secrets, its life, its terror, its beauty, its\\nsadness, and its joy; and if so, how full, how wonderful must be his\\nmind! He spoke of men as no better than wolves. Could a lonely life\\nin the wilderness teach a man that? Bitterness, envy, jealousy, spite,\\ngreed, and hate  these had no place in this hunter's heart. It was not\\nHelen's shrewdness, but a woman's intuition, which divined that.\\n\\nDale rose to his feet and, turning his ear to the north, listened once\\nmore.\\n\\n“Are you expecting Roy still?” inquired Helen.\\n\\n“No, it ain't likely he'll turn up to night,” replied Dale, and then he\\nstrode over to put a hand on the pine tree that soared above where the\\ngirls lay. His action, and the way he looked up at the tree top and then\\nat adjacent trees, held more of that significance which so interested\\nHelen.\\n\\n“I reckon he's stood there some five hundred years an' will stand\\nthrough to night,” muttered Dale.\\n\\nThis pine was the monarch of that wide spread group.\\n\\n“Listen again,” said Dale.\\n\\nBo was asleep. And Helen, listening, at once caught low, distant roar.\\n\\n“Wind. It's goin' to storm,” explained Dale. “You'll hear somethin'\\nworth while. But don't be scared. Reckon we'll be safe. Pines blow down\\noften. But this fellow will stand any fall wind that ever was... Better\\nslip under the blankets so I can pull the tarp up.”\\n\\nHelen slid down, just as she was, fully dressed except for boots, which\\nshe and Bo had removed; and she laid her head close to Bo's. Dale pulled\\nthe tarpaulin up and folded it back just below their heads.\\n\\n“When it rains you'll wake, an' then just pull the tarp up over you,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“Will it rain?” Helen asked. But she was thinking that this moment\\nwas the strangest that had ever happened to her. By the light of the\\ncamp fire she saw Dale's face, just as usual, still, darkly serene,\\nexpressing no thought. He was kind, but he was not thinking of these\\nsisters as girls, alone with him in a pitch black forest, helpless and\\ndefenseless. He did not seem to be thinking at all. But Helen had never\\nbefore in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience.\\n\\n“I'll be close by an' keep the fire goin' all night,” he said.\\n\\nShe heard him stride off into the darkness. Presently there came a\\ndragging, bumping sound, then a crash of a log dropped upon the fire.\\nA cloud of sparks shot up, and many pattered down to hiss upon the damp\\nground. Smoke again curled upward along the great, seamed tree trunk,\\nand flames sputtered and crackled.\\n\\nHelen listened again for the roar of wind. It seemed to come on a breath\\nof air that fanned her cheek and softly blew Bo's curls, and it was\\nstronger. But it died out presently, only to come again, and still\\nstronger. Helen realized then that the sound was that of an approaching\\nstorm. Her heavy eyelids almost refused to stay open, and she knew if\\nshe let them close she would instantly drop to sleep. And she wanted to\\nhear the storm wind in the pines.\\n\\nA few drops of cold rain fell upon her face, thrilling her with the\\nproof that no roof stood between her and the elements. Then a breeze\\nbore the smell of burnt wood into her face, and somehow her quick mind\\nflew to girlhood days when she burned brush and leaves with her little\\nbrothers. The memory faded. The roar that had seemed distant was now\\nback in the forest, coming swiftly, increasing in volume. Like a\\nstream in flood it bore down. Helen grew amazed, startled. How rushing,\\noncoming, and heavy this storm wind! She likened its approach to the\\ntread of an army. Then the roar filled the forest, yet it was back there\\nbehind her. Not a pine needle quivered in the light of the camp fire.\\nBut the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge. The roar\\naugmented till it was no longer a roar, but an on sweeping crash, like\\nan ocean torrent engulfing the earth. Bo awoke to cling to Helen\\nwith fright. The deafening storm blast was upon them. Helen felt the\\nsaddle pillow move under her head. The giant pine had trembled to its\\nvery roots. That mighty fury of wind was all aloft, in the tree tops.\\nAnd for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power.\\nThen the deafening crash passed to roar, and that swept on and on,\\nlessening in volume, deepening in low detonation, at last to die in the\\ndistance.\\n\\nNo sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and\\nceased and rose again. Helen lay there, whispering to Bo, and heard\\nagain the great wave of wind come and crash and cease. That was the way\\nof this storm wind of the mountain forest.\\n\\nA soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned Helen to remember Dale's\\ndirections, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike\\nover the saddle. Then, with Bo close and warm beside her, she closed\\nher eyes, and the sense of the black forest and the wind and rain\\nfaded. Last of all sensations was the smell of smoke that blew under the\\ntarpaulin.\\n\\n\\nWhen she opened her eyes she remembered everything, as if only a moment\\nhad elapsed. But it was daylight, though gray and cloudy. The pines were\\ndripping mist. A fire crackled cheerily and blue smoke curled upward and\\na savory odor of hot coffee hung in the air. Horses were standing\\nnear by, biting and kicking at one another. Bo was sound asleep. Dale\\nappeared busy around the camp fire. As Helen watched the hunter she\\nsaw him pause in his task, turn his ear to listen, and then look\\nexpectantly. And at that juncture a shout pealed from the forest.\\nHelen recognized Roy's voice. Then she heard a splashing of water, and\\nhoof beats coming closer. With that the buckskin mustang trotted into\\ncamp, carrying Roy.\\n\\n“Bad mornin' for ducks, but good for us,” he called.\\n\\n“Howdy, Roy!” greeted Dale, and his gladness was unmistakable. “I was\\nlookin' for you.”\\n\\nRoy appeared to slide off the mustang without effort, and his swift\\nhands slapped the straps as he unsaddled. Buckskin was wet with sweat\\nand foam mixed with rain. He heaved. And steam rose from him.\\n\\n“Must have rode hard,” observed Dale.\\n\\n“I shore did,” replied Roy. Then he espied Helen, who had sat up, with\\nhands to her hair, and eyes staring at him.\\n\\n“Mornin', miss. It's good news.”\\n\\n“Thank Heaven!” murmured Helen, and then she shook Bo. That young lady\\nawoke, but was loath to give up slumber. “Bo! Bo! Wake up! Mr. Roy is\\nback.”\\n\\nWhereupon Bo sat up, disheveled and sleepy eyed.\\n\\n“Oh h, but I ache!” she moaned. But her eyes took in the camp scene to\\nthe effect that she added, “Is breakfast ready?”\\n\\n“Almost. An' flapjacks this mornin',” replied Dale.\\n\\nBo manifested active symptoms of health in the manner with which she\\nlaced her boots. Helen got their traveling bag, and with this they\\nrepaired to a flat stone beside the spring, not, however, out of earshot\\nof the men.\\n\\n“How long are you goin' to hang around camp before tellin' me?” inquired\\nDale.\\n\\n“Jest as I figgered, Milt,” replied Roy. “Thet rider who passed you was\\na messenger to Anson. He an' his gang got on our trail quick. About ten\\no'clock I seen them comin'. Then I lit out for the woods. I stayed off\\nin the woods close enough to see where they come in. An' shore they\\nlost your trail. Then they spread through the woods, workin' off to the\\nsouth, thinkin', of course, thet you would circle round to Pine on the\\nsouth side of Old Baldy. There ain't a hoss tracker in Snake Anson's\\ngang, thet's shore. Wal, I follered them for an hour till they'd rustled\\nsome miles off our trail. Then I went back to where you struck into\\nthe woods. An' I waited there all afternoon till dark, expectin' mebbe\\nthey'd back trail. But they didn't. I rode on a ways an' camped in the\\nwoods till jest before daylight.”\\n\\n“So far so good,” declared Dale.\\n\\n“Shore. There's rough country south of Baldy an' along the two or three\\ntrails Anson an' his outfit will camp, you bet.”\\n\\n“It ain't to be thought of,” muttered Dale, at some idea that had struck\\nhim.\\n\\n“What ain't?”\\n\\n“Goin' round the north side of Baldy.”\\n\\n“It shore ain't,” rejoined Roy, bluntly.\\n\\n“Then I've got to hide tracks certain  rustle to my camp an' stay there\\ntill you say it's safe to risk takin' the girls to Pine.”\\n\\n“Milt, you're talkin' the wisdom of the prophets.”\\n\\n“I ain't so sure we can hide tracks altogether. If Anson had any eyes\\nfor the woods he'd not have lost me so soon.\\n\\n“No. But, you see, he's figgerin' to cross your trail.”\\n\\n“If I could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an' hide tracks\\ncertain, I'd feel safe from pursuit, anyway,” said the hunter,\\nreflectively.\\n\\n“Shore an' easy,” responded Roy, quickly. “I jest met up with some\\ngreaser sheep herders drivin' a big flock. They've come up from the\\nsouth an' are goin' to fatten up at Turkey Senacas. Then they'll drive\\nback south an' go on to Phenix. Wal, it's muddy weather. Now you break\\ncamp quick an' make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail, as if you\\nwas travelin' south. But, instead, you ride round ahead of thet flock of\\nsheep. They'll keep to the open parks an' the trails through them necks\\nof woods out here. An', passin' over your tracks, they'll hide 'em.”\\n\\n“But supposin' Anson circles an' hits this camp? He'll track me easy out\\nto that sheep trail. What then?”\\n\\n“Jest what you want. Goin' south thet sheep trail is downhill an' muddy.\\nIt's goin' to rain hard. Your tracks would get washed out even if you\\ndid go south. An' Anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the\\nscent. Leave it to me, Milt. You're a hunter. But I'm a hoss tracker.”\\n\\n“All right. We'll rustle.”\\n\\nThen he called the girls to hurry.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nOnce astride the horse again, Helen had to congratulate herself upon not\\nbeing so crippled as she had imagined. Indeed, Bo made all the audible\\ncomplaints.\\n\\nBoth girls had long water proof coats, brand new, and of which they were\\nconsiderably proud. New clothes had not been a common event in their\\nlives.\\n\\n“Reckon I'll have to slit these,” Dale had said, whipping out a huge\\nknife.\\n\\n“What for?” had been Bo's feeble protest.\\n\\n“They wasn't made for ridin'. An' you'll get wet enough even if I do cut\\nthem. An' if I don't, you'll get soaked.”\\n\\n“Go ahead,” had been Helen's reluctant permission.\\n\\nSo their long new coats were slit half way up the back. The exigency of\\nthe case was manifest to Helen, when she saw how they came down over the\\ncantles of the saddles and to their boot tops.\\n\\nThe morning was gray and cold. A fine, misty rain fell and the trees\\ndripped steadily. Helen was surprised to see the open country again and\\nthat apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while. The\\ncountry was wide and flat on the right, and to the left it rolled and\\nheaved along a black, scalloped timber line. Above this bordering of\\nthe forest low, drifting clouds obscured the mountains. The wind was at\\nHelen's back and seemed to be growing stronger. Dale and Roy were ahead,\\ntraveling at a good trot, with the pack animals bunched before them.\\nHelen and Bo had enough to do to keep up.\\n\\nThe first hour's ride brought little change in weather or scenery, but\\nit gave Helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up\\nall day. She began to welcome the places where the horses walked, but\\nshe disliked the levels. As for the descents, she hated those. Ranger\\nwould not go down slowly and the shake up she received was unpleasant.\\nMoreover, the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and\\nwashes. He sailed over them like a bird. Helen could not acquire the\\nknack of sitting the saddle properly, and so, not only was her person\\nbruised on these occasions, but her feelings were hurt. Helen had\\nnever before been conscious of vanity. Still, she had never rejoiced\\nin looking at a disadvantage, and her exhibitions here must have been\\nfrightful. Bo always would forge to the front, and she seldom looked\\nback, for which Helen was grateful.\\n\\nBefore long they struck into a broad, muddy belt, full of innumerable\\nsmall hoof tracks. This, then, was the sheep trail Roy had advised\\nfollowing. They rode on it for three or four miles, and at length,\\ncoming to a gray green valley, they saw a huge flock of sheep. Soon the\\nair was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep, and a\\nlow, soft roar of pattering hoofs. The flock held a compact formation,\\ncovering several acres, and grazed along rapidly. There were three\\nherders on horses and several pack burros. Dale engaged one of the\\nMexicans in conversation, and passed something to him, then pointed\\nnorthward and down along the trail. The Mexican grinned from ear to ear,\\nand Helen caught the quick “SI, SENOR! GRACIAS, SENOR!” It was a pretty\\nsight, that flock of sheep, as it rolled along like a rounded woolly\\nstream of grays and browns and here and there a black. They were keeping\\nto a trail over the flats. Dale headed into this trail and, if anything,\\ntrotted a little faster.\\n\\nPresently the clouds lifted and broke, showing blue sky and one streak\\nof sunshine. But the augury was without warrant. The wind increased. A\\nhuge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that\\ncould be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a\\nswiftly moving wall. Soon it enveloped the fugitives.\\n\\nWith head bowed, Helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold, gray\\nrain that blew almost on a level. Finally the heavy downpour passed,\\nleaving a fine mist. The clouds scurried low and dark, hiding the\\nmountains altogether and making the gray, wet plain a dreary sight.\\nHelen's feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water. And\\nthey were cold. Her gloves, too, had not been intended for rain, and\\nthey were wet through. The cold bit at her fingers so that she had to\\nbeat her hands together. Ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was\\nto trot faster, which event was worse for Helen than freezing.\\n\\nShe saw another black, scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its\\ntrailing sheets of rain, and this one appeared streaked with white.\\nSnow! The wind was now piercingly cold. Helen's body kept warm, but\\nher extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly. She gazed ahead\\ngrimly. There was no help; she had to go on. Dale and Roy were hunched\\ndown in their saddles, probably wet through, for they wore no rain proof\\ncoats. Bo kept close behind them, and plain it was that she felt the\\ncold.\\n\\nThis second storm was not so bad as the first, because there was less\\nrain. Still, the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow. It lasted\\nfor an hour, during which the horses trotted on, trotted on. Again the\\ngray torrent roared away, the fine mist blew, the clouds lifted and\\nseparated, and, closing again, darkened for another onslaught. This one\\nbrought sleet. The driving pellets stung Helen's neck and cheeks, and\\nfor a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was\\nafraid she could not hold up under them. The bare places on the ground\\nshowed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice.\\n\\nThus, storm after storm rolled over Helen's head. Her feet grew numb\\nand ceased to hurt. But her fingers, because of her ceaseless efforts\\nto keep up the circulation, retained the stinging pain. And now the wind\\npierced right through her. She marveled at her endurance, and there were\\nmany times that she believed she could not ride farther. Yet she kept\\non. All the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as\\nthis. Hard and cold, wet and windy, at an increasing elevation  that was\\nthe explanation. The air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood.\\n\\nStill, during all those interminable hours, Helen watched where she was\\ntraveling, and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize\\nit. The afternoon appeared far advanced when Dale and Roy led down into\\nan immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats. They rode\\nalong its margin, splashing up to the knees of the horses. Cranes and\\nherons flew on with lumbering motion; flocks of ducks winged swift\\nflight from one side to the other. Beyond this depression the land\\nsloped rather abruptly; outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of\\nthe highest ground, and again a dark fringe of trees appeared.\\n\\nHow many miles! wondered Helen. They seemed as many and as long as\\nthe hours. But at last, just as another hard rain came, the pines\\nwere reached. They proved to be widely scattered and afforded little\\nprotection from the storm.\\n\\nHelen sat her saddle, a dead weight. Whenever Ranger quickened his gait\\nor crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling\\noff. Her mind harbored only sensations of misery, and a persistent\\nthought  why did she ever leave home for the West? Her solicitude for Bo\\nhad been forgotten. Nevertheless, any marked change in the topography\\nof the country was registered, perhaps photographed on her memory by the\\ntorturing vividness of her experience.\\n\\nThe forest grew more level and denser. Shadows of twilight or gloom lay\\nunder the trees. Presently Dale and Roy, disappeared, going downhill,\\nand likewise Bo. Then Helen's ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid\\nwater. Ranger trotted faster. Soon Helen came to the edge of a great\\nvalley, black and gray, so full of obscurity that she could not see\\nacross or down into it. But she knew there was a rushing river at\\nthe bottom. The sound was deep, continuous, a heavy, murmuring roar,\\nsingularly musical. The trail was steep. Helen had not lost all feeling,\\nas she had believed and hoped. Her poor, mistreated body still responded\\nexcruciatingly to concussions, jars, wrenches, and all the other\\nhorrible movements making up a horse trot.\\n\\nFor long Helen did not look up. When she did so there lay a green,\\nwillow bordered, treeless space at the bottom of the valley, through\\nwhich a brown white stream rushed with steady, ear filling roar.\\n\\nDale and Roy drove the pack animals across the stream, and followed,\\ngoing deep to the flanks of their horses. Bo rode into the foaming water\\nas if she had been used to it all her days. A slip, a fall, would have\\nmeant that Bo must drown in that mountain torrent.\\n\\nRanger trotted straight to the edge, and there, obedient to Helen's\\nclutch on the bridle, he halted. The stream was fifty feet wide, shallow\\non the near side, deep on the opposite, with fast current and big waves.\\nHelen was simply too frightened to follow.\\n\\n“Let him come!” yelled Dale. “Stick on now!... Ranger!”\\n\\nThe big black plunged in, making the water fly. That stream was nothing\\nfor him, though it seemed impassable to Helen. She had not the strength\\nleft to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them. Ranger, in two\\nmore plunges, surmounted the bank, and then, trotting across the green\\nto where the other horses stood steaming under some pines, he gave a\\ngreat heave and halted.\\n\\nRoy reached up to help her off.\\n\\n“Thirty miles, Miss Helen,” he said, and the way he spoke was a\\ncompliment.\\n\\nHe had to lift her off and help her to the tree where Bo leaned. Dale\\nhad ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddle blankets on the ground\\nunder the pine.\\n\\n“Nell  you swore  you loved me!” was Bo's mournful greeting. The girl\\nwas pale, drawn, blue lipped, and she could not stand up.\\n\\n“Bo, I never did  or I'd never have brought you to this  wretch that I\\nam!” cried Helen. “Oh, what a horrible ride!”\\n\\nRain was falling, the trees were dripping, the sky was lowering. All the\\nground was soaking wet, with pools and puddles everywhere. Helen could\\nimagine nothing but a heartless, dreary, cold prospect. Just then home\\nwas vivid and poignant in her thoughts. Indeed, so utterly miserable\\nwas she that the exquisite relief of sitting down, of a cessation of\\nmovement, of a release from that infernal perpetual trotting horse,\\nseemed only a mockery. It could not be true that the time had come for\\nrest.\\n\\nEvidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheep herders,\\nfor there were remains of a fire. Dale lifted the burnt end of a log\\nand brought it down hard upon the ground, splitting off pieces. Several\\ntimes he did this. It was amazing to see his strength, his facility, as\\nhe split off handfuls of splinters. He collected a bundle of them, and,\\nlaying them down, he bent over them. Roy wielded the ax on another log,\\nand each stroke split off a long strip. Then a tiny column of smoke\\ndrifted up over Dale's shoulder as he leaned, bareheaded, sheltering the\\nsplinters with his hat. A blaze leaped up. Roy came with an armful of\\nstrips all white and dry, out of the inside of a log. Crosswise these\\nwere laid over the blaze, and it began to roar. Then piece by piece the\\nmen built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods, branches\\nand stumps and logs, erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke\\nroared upward. It had not taken two minutes. Already Helen felt the\\nwarmth on her icy face. She held up her bare, numb hands.\\n\\nBoth Dale and Roy were wet through to the skin, yet they did not tarry\\nbeside the fire. They relieved the horses. A lasso went up between two\\npines, and a tarpaulin over it, V shaped and pegged down at the four\\nends. The packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and\\nbedding were placed under this shelter.\\n\\nHelen thought this might have taken five minutes more. In this short\\nspace of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot.\\nRain was falling steadily all around, but over and near that roaring\\nblaze, ten feet high, no water fell. It evaporated. The ground began to\\nsteam and to dry. Helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out\\nthe cold. But presently the pain ceased.\\n\\n“Nell, I never knew before how good a fire could feel,” declared Bo.\\n\\nAnd therein lay more food for Helen's reflection.\\n\\nIn ten minutes Helen was dry and hot. Darkness came down upon the\\ndreary, sodden forest, but that great camp fire made it a different\\nworld from the one Helen had anticipated. It blazed and roared, cracked\\nlike a pistol, hissed and sputtered, shot sparks everywhere, and sent\\naloft a dense, yellow, whirling column of smoke. It began to have a\\nheart of gold.\\n\\nDale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the\\ncoffee pot and oven soon began to steam.\\n\\n“Roy, I promised the girls turkey to night,” said the hunter.\\n\\n“Mebbe to morrow, if the wind shifts. This 's turkey country.”\\n\\n“Roy, a potato will do me!” exclaimed Bo. “Never again will I ask for\\ncake and pie! I never appreciated good things to eat. And I've been a\\nlittle pig, always. I never  never knew what it was to be hungry  until\\nnow.”\\n\\nDale glanced up quickly.\\n\\n“Lass, it's worth learnin',” he said.\\n\\nHelen's thought was too deep for words. In such brief space had she been\\ntransformed from misery to comfort!\\n\\nThe rain kept on falling, though it appeared to grow softer as night\\nsettled down black. The wind died away and the forest was still, except\\nfor the steady roar of the stream. A folded tarpaulin was laid between\\nthe pine and the fire, well in the light and warmth, and upon it the\\nmen set steaming pots and plates and cups, the fragrance from which was\\nstrong and inviting.\\n\\n“Fetch the saddle blanket an' set with your backs to the fire,” said\\nRoy.\\n\\n\\nLater, when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and\\nsheltered from the rain, Helen remained awake after Bo had fallen\\nasleep. The big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day. She\\ncould see the smoke, the trunk of the big pine towering aloft, and\\na blank space of sky. The stream hummed a song, seemingly musical at\\ntimes, and then discordant and dull, now low, now roaring, and always\\nrushing, gurgling, babbling, flowing, chafing in its hurry.\\n\\nPresently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses,\\nand beside the fire they conversed in low tones.\\n\\n“Wal, thet trail we made to day will be hid, I reckon,” said Roy, with\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\n“What wasn't sheeped over would be washed out. We've had luck. An' now I\\nain't worryin',” returned Dale.\\n\\n“Worryin'? Then it's the first I ever knowed you to do.”\\n\\n“Man, I never had a job like this,” protested the hunter.\\n\\n“Wal, thet's so.”\\n\\n“Now, Roy, when old Al Auchincloss finds out about this deal, as he's\\nbound to when you or the boys get back to Pine, he's goin' to roar.”\\n\\n“Do you reckon folks will side with him against Beasley?”\\n\\n“Some of them. But Al, like as not, will tell folks to go where it's\\nhot. He'll bunch his men an' strike for the mountains to find his\\nnieces.”\\n\\n“Wal, all you've got to do is to keep the girls hid till I can guide him\\nup to your camp. Or, failin' thet, till you can slip the girls down to\\nPine.”\\n\\n“No one but you an' your brothers ever seen my senaca. But it could be\\nfound easy enough.”\\n\\n“Anson might blunder on it. But thet ain't likely.”\\n\\n“Why ain't it?”\\n\\n“Because I'll stick to thet sheep thief's tracks like a wolf after a\\nbleedin' deer. An' if he ever gets near your camp I'll ride in ahead of\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Good!” declared Dale. “I was calculatin' you'd go down to Pine, sooner\\nor later.”\\n\\n“Not unless Anson goes. I told John thet in case there was no fight on\\nthe stage to make a bee line back to Pine. He was to tell Al an' offer\\nhis services along with Joe an' Hal.”\\n\\n“One way or another, then, there's bound to be blood spilled over this.”\\n\\n“Shore! An' high time. I jest hope I get a look down my old 'forty four'\\nat thet Beasley.”\\n\\n“In that case I hope you hold straighter than times I've seen you.”\\n\\n“Milt Dale, I'm a good shot,” declared Roy, stoutly.\\n\\n“You're no good on movin' targets.”\\n\\n“Wal, mebbe so. But I'm not lookin' for a movin' target when I meet up\\nwith Beasley. I'm a hossman, not a hunter. You're used to shootin' flies\\noff deer's horns, jest for practice.”\\n\\n“Roy, can we make my camp by to morrow night?” queried Dale, more\\nseriously.\\n\\n“We will, if each of us has to carry one of the girls. But they'll do it\\nor die. Dale, did you ever see a gamer girl than thet kid Bo?”\\n\\n“Me! Where'd I ever see any girls?” ejaculated Dale. “I remember some\\nwhen I was a boy, but I was only fourteen then. Never had much use for\\ngirls.”\\n\\n“I'd like to have a wife like that Bo,” declared Roy, fervidly.\\n\\nThere ensued a moment's silence.\\n\\n“Roy, you're a Mormon an' you already got a wife,” was Dale's reply.\\n\\n“Now, Milt, have you lived so long in the woods thet you never heard of\\na Mormon with two wives?” returned Roy, and then he laughed heartily.\\n\\n“I never could stomach what I did hear pertainin' to more than one wife\\nfor a man.”\\n\\n“Wal, my friend, you go an' get yourself ONE. An' see then if you\\nwouldn't like to have TWO.”\\n\\n“I reckon one 'd be more than enough for Milt Dale.”\\n\\n“Milt, old man, let me tell you thet I always envied you your freedom,”\\n said Roy, earnestly. “But it ain't life.”\\n\\n“You mean life is love of a woman?”\\n\\n“No. Thet's only part. I mean a son  a boy thet's like you  thet you\\nfeel will go on with your life after you're gone.”\\n\\n“I've thought of that  thought it all out, watchin' the birds an'\\nanimals mate in the woods... If I have no son I'll never live\\nhereafter.”\\n\\n“Wal,” replied Roy, hesitatingly, “I don't go in so deep as thet. I mean\\na son goes on with your blood an' your work.”\\n\\n“Exactly... An', Roy, I envy you what you've got, because it's out of\\nall bounds for Milt Dale.”\\n\\nThose words, sad and deep, ended the conversation. Again the rumbling,\\nrushing stream dominated the forest. An owl hooted dismally. A horse\\ntrod thuddingly near by and from that direction came a cutting tear of\\nteeth on grass.\\n\\n\\nA voice pierced Helen's deep dreams and, awaking, she found Bo shaking\\nand calling her.\\n\\n“Are you dead?” came the gay voice.\\n\\n“Almost. Oh, my back's broken,” replied Helen. The desire to move seemed\\nclamped in a vise, and even if that came she believed the effort would\\nbe impossible.\\n\\n“Roy called us,” said Bo. “He said hurry. I thought I'd die just sitting\\nup, and I'd give you a million dollars to lace my boots. Wait, sister,\\ntill you try to pull on one of those stiff boots!”\\n\\nWith heroic and violent spirit Helen sat up to find that in the act\\nher aches and pains appeared beyond number. Reaching for her boots,\\nshe found them cold and stiff. Helen unlaced one and, opening it wide,\\nessayed to get her sore foot down into it. But her foot appeared swollen\\nand the boot appeared shrunken. She could not get it half on, though\\nshe expended what little strength seemed left in her aching arms. She\\ngroaned.\\n\\nBo laughed wickedly. Her hair was tousled, her eyes dancing, her cheeks\\nred.\\n\\n“Be game!” she said. “Stand up like a real Western girl and PULL your\\nboot on.”\\n\\nWhether Bo's scorn or advice made the task easier did not occur to\\nHelen, but the fact was that she got into her boots. Walking and\\nmoving a little appeared to loosen the stiff joints and ease that tired\\nfeeling. The water of the stream where the girls washed was colder than\\nany ice Helen had ever felt. It almost paralyzed her hands. Bo mumbled,\\nand blew like a porpoise. They had to run to the fire before being able\\nto comb their hair. The air was wonderfully keen. The dawn was clear,\\nbright, with a red glow in the east where the sun was about to rise.\\n\\n“All ready, girls,” called Roy. “Reckon you can help yourselves. Milt\\nain't comin' in very fast with the hosses. I'll rustle off to help him.\\nWe've got a hard day before us. Yesterday wasn't nowhere to what to day\\n'll be.”\\n\\n“But the sun's going to shine?” implored Bo.\\n\\n“Wal, you bet,” rejoined Roy, as he strode off.\\n\\nHelen and Bo ate breakfast and had the camp to themselves for perhaps\\nhalf an hour; then the horses came thudding down, with Dale and Roy\\nriding bareback.\\n\\nBy the time all was in readiness to start the sun was up, melting the\\nfrost and ice, so that a dazzling, bright mist, full of rainbows, shone\\nunder the trees.\\n\\nDale looked Ranger over, and tried the cinches of Bo's horse.\\n\\n“What's your choice  a long ride behind the packs with me  or a short\\ncut over the hills with Roy?” he asked.\\n\\n“I choose the lesser of two rides,” replied Helen, smiling.\\n\\n“Reckon that 'll be easier, but you'll know you've had a ride,” said\\nDale, significantly.\\n\\n“What was that we had yesterday?” asked Bo, archly.\\n\\n“Only thirty miles, but cold an' wet. To day will be fine for ridin'.”\\n\\n“Milt, I'll take a blanket an' some grub in case you don't meet us\\nto night,” said Roy. “An' I reckon we'll split up here where I'll have\\nto strike out on thet short cut.”\\n\\nBo mounted without a helping hand, but Helen's limbs were so stiff that\\nshe could not get astride the high Ranger without assistance. The hunter\\nheaded up the slope of the canyon, which on that side was not steep.\\nIt was brown pine forest, with here and there a clump of dark,\\nsilver pointed evergreens that Roy called spruce. By the time this slope\\nwas surmounted Helen's aches were not so bad. The saddle appeared to\\nfit her better, and the gait of the horse was not so unfamiliar. She\\nreflected, however, that she always had done pretty well uphill. Here it\\nwas beautiful forest land, uneven and wilder. They rode for a time along\\nthe rim, with the white rushing stream in plain sight far below, with\\nits melodious roar ever thrumming in the ear.\\n\\nDale reined in and peered down at the pine mat.\\n\\n“Fresh deer sign all along here,” he said, pointing.\\n\\n“Wal, I seen thet long ago,” rejoined Roy.\\n\\nHelen's scrutiny was rewarded by descrying several tiny depressions in\\nthe pine needles, dark in color and sharply defined.\\n\\n“We may never get a better chance,” said Dale. “Those deer are workin'\\nup our way. Get your rifle out.”\\n\\nTravel was resumed then, with Roy a little in advance of the pack train.\\nPresently he dismounted, threw his bridle, and cautiously peered ahead.\\nThen, turning, he waved his sombrero. The pack animals halted in a\\nbunch. Dale beckoned for the girls to follow and rode up to Roy's horse.\\nThis point, Helen saw, was at the top of an intersecting canuon. Dale\\ndismounted, without drawing his rifle from its saddle sheath, and\\napproached Roy.\\n\\n“Buck an' two does,” he said, low voiced. “An' they've winded us, but\\ndon't see us yet... Girls, ride up closer.”\\n\\nFollowing the directions indicated by Dale's long arm, Helen looked down\\nthe slope. It was open, with tall pines here and there, and clumps of\\nsilver spruce, and aspens shining like gold in the morning sunlight.\\nPresently Bo exclaimed: “Oh, look! I see! I see!” Then Helen's roving\\nglance passed something different from green and gold and brown.\\nShifting back to it she saw a magnificent stag, with noble spreading\\nantlers, standing like a statue, his head up in alert and wild posture.\\nHis color was gray. Beside him grazed two deer of slighter and more\\ngraceful build, without horns.\\n\\n“It's downhill,” whispered Dale. “An' you're goin' to overshoot.”\\n\\nThen Helen saw that Roy had his rifle leveled.\\n\\n“Oh, don't!” she cried.\\n\\nDale's remark evidently nettled Roy. He lowered the rifle.\\n\\n“Milt, it's me lookin' over this gun. How can you stand there an' tell\\nme I'm goin' to shoot high? I had a dead bead on him.”\\n\\n“Roy, you didn't allow for downhill... Hurry. He sees us now.”\\n\\nRoy leveled the rifle and, taking aim as before, he fired. The buck\\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he had indeed been stone. The does,\\nhowever, jumped with a start, and gazed in fright in every direction.\\n\\n“Told you! I seen where your bullet hit thet pine  half a foot over his\\nshoulder. Try again an' aim at his legs.”\\n\\nRoy now took a quicker aim and pulled trigger. A puff of dust right at\\nthe feet of the buck showed where Roy's lead had struck this time. With\\na single bound, wonderful to see, the big deer was out of sight behind\\ntrees and brush. The does leaped after him.\\n\\n“Doggone the luck!” ejaculated Roy, red in the face, as he worked the\\nlever of his rifle. “Never could shoot downhill, nohow!”\\n\\nHis rueful apology to the girls for missing brought a merry laugh from\\nBo.\\n\\n“Not for worlds would I have had you kill that beautiful deer!” she\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n“We won't have venison steak off him, that's certain,” remarked Dale,\\ndryly. “An' maybe none off any deer, if Roy does the shootin'.”\\n\\nThey resumed travel, sheering off to the right and keeping to the edge\\nof the intersecting canuon. At length they rode down to the bottom,\\nwhere a tiny brook babbled through willows, and they followed this for\\na mile or so down to where it flowed into the larger stream. A dim trail\\novergrown with grass showed at this point.\\n\\n“Here's where we part,” said Dale. “You'll beat me into my camp, but\\nI'll get there sometime after dark.”\\n\\n“Hey, Milt, I forgot about thet darned pet cougar of yours an' the rest\\nof your menagerie. Reckon they won't scare the girls? Especially old\\nTom?”\\n\\n“You won't see Tom till I get home,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Ain't he corralled or tied up?”\\n\\n“No. He has the run of the place.”\\n\\n“Wal, good by, then, an' rustle along.”\\n\\nDale nodded to the girls, and, turning his horse, he drove the\\npack train before him up the open space between the stream and the\\nwooded slope.\\n\\nRoy stepped off his horse with that single action which appeared such a\\nfeat to Helen.\\n\\n“Guess I'd better cinch up,” he said, as he threw a stirrup up over the\\npommel of his saddle. “You girls are goin' to see wild country.”\\n\\n“Who's old Tom?” queried Bo, curiously.\\n\\n“Why, he's Milt's pet cougar.”\\n\\n“Cougar? That's a panther  a mountain lion, didn't he say?”\\n\\n“Shore is. Tom is a beauty. An' if he takes a likin' to you he'll love\\nyou, play with you, maul you half to death.”\\n\\nBo was all eyes.\\n\\n“Dale has other pets, too?” she questioned, eagerly.\\n\\n“I never was up to his camp but what it was overrun with birds an'\\nsquirrels an' vermin of all kinds, as tame as tame as cows. Too darn\\ntame, Milt says. But I can't figger thet. You girls will never want to\\nleave thet senaca of his.”\\n\\n“What's a senaca?” asked Helen, as she shifted her foot to let him\\ntighten the cinches on her saddle.\\n\\n“Thet's Mexican for park, I guess,” he replied. “These mountains are\\nfull of parks; an', say, I don't ever want to see no prettier place till\\nI get to heaven... There, Ranger, old boy, thet's tight.”\\n\\nHe slapped the horse affectionately, and, turning to his own, he stepped\\nand swung his long length up.\\n\\n“It ain't deep crossin' here. Come on,” he called, and spurred his bay.\\n\\nThe stream here was wide and it looked deep, but turned out to be\\ndeceptive.\\n\\n“Wal, girls, here beginneth the second lesson,” he drawled, cheerily.\\n“Ride one behind the other  stick close to me  do what I do  an' holler\\nwhen you want to rest or if somethin' goes bad.”\\n\\nWith that he spurred into the thicket. Bo went next and Helen followed.\\nThe willows dragged at her so hard that she was unable to watch Roy, and\\nthe result was that a low sweeping branch of a tree knocked her hard\\non the head. It hurt and startled her, and roused her mettle. Roy was\\nkeeping to the easy trot that covered ground so well, and he led up\\na slope to the open pine forest. Here the ride for several miles was\\nstraight, level, and open. Helen liked the forest to day. It was brown\\nand green, with patches of gold where the sun struck. She saw her first\\nbird  big blue grouse that whirred up from under her horse, and little\\ncheckered gray quail that appeared awkward on the wing. Several times\\nRoy pointed out deer flashing gray across some forest aisle, and often\\nwhen he pointed Helen was not quick enough to see.\\n\\nHelen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of\\nyesterday. So far she had been only barely conscious of sore places\\nand aching bones. These she would bear with. She loved the wild and the\\nbeautiful, both of which increased manifestly with every mile. The sun\\nwas warm, the air fragrant and cool, the sky blue as azure and so deep\\nthat she imagined that she could look far up into it.\\n\\nSuddenly Roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short.\\n\\n“Look!” he called, sharply.\\n\\nBo screamed.\\n\\n“Not thet way! Here! Aw, he's gone!”\\n\\n“Nell! It was a bear! I saw it! Oh! not like circus bears at all!” cried\\nBo.\\n\\nHelen had missed her opportunity.\\n\\n“Reckon he was a grizzly, an' I'm jest as well pleased thet he loped\\noff,” said Roy. Altering his course somewhat, he led to an old rotten\\nlog that the bear had been digging in. “After grubs. There, see his\\ntrack. He was a whopper shore enough.”\\n\\nThey rode on, out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range,\\ngorge and ridge, green and black as far as Helen could see. The ranges\\nwere bold and long, climbing to the central uplift, where a number of\\nfringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of Old Baldy.\\nFar as vision could see, to the right lay one rolling forest of pine,\\nbeautiful and serene. Somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert,\\nbut it was not in sight.\\n\\n“I see turkeys 'way down there,” said Roy, backing away. “We'll go down\\nand around an' mebbe I'll get a shot.”\\n\\nDescent beyond a rocky point was made through thick brush. This slope\\nconsisted of wide benches covered with copses and scattered pines and\\nmany oaks. Helen was delighted to see the familiar trees, although these\\nwere different from Missouri oaks. Rugged and gnarled, but not tall,\\nthese trees spread wide branches, the leaves of which were yellowing.\\nRoy led into a grassy glade, and, leaping off his horse, rifle in hand,\\nhe prepared to shoot at something. Again Bo cried out, but this time it\\nwas in delight. Then Helen saw an immense flock of turkeys, apparently\\nlike the turkeys she knew at home, but these had bronze and checks\\nof white, and they looked wild. There must have been a hundred in the\\nflock, most of them hens. A few gobblers on the far side began the\\nflight, running swiftly off. Helen plainly heard the thud of their\\nfeet. Roy shot once  twice  three times. Then rose a great commotion and\\nthumping, and a loud roar of many wings. Dust and leaves whirling in the\\nair were left where the turkeys had been.\\n\\n“Wal, I got two,” said Roy, and he strode forward to pick up his game.\\nReturning, he tied two shiny, plump gobblers back of his saddle and\\nremounted his horse. “We'll have turkey to night, if Milt gets to camp\\nin time.”\\n\\nThe ride was resumed. Helen never would have tired riding through those\\noak groves, brown and sear and yellow, with leaves and acorns falling.\\n\\n“Bears have been workin' in here already,” said Roy. “I see tracks all\\nover. They eat acorns in the fall. An' mebbe we'll run into one yet.”\\n\\nThe farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees, so that\\ndodging branches was no light task. Ranger did not seem to care how\\nclose he passed a tree or under a limb, so that he missed them himself;\\nbut Helen thereby got some additional bruises. Particularly hard was it,\\nwhen passing a tree, to get her knee out of the way in time.\\n\\nRoy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation\\nand in places covered with a thick scum. But it had a current and an\\noutlet, proving it to be a huge, spring. Roy pointed down at a muddy\\nplace.\\n\\n“Bear wallow. He heard us comin'. Look at thet little track. Cub track.\\nAn' look at these scratches on this tree, higher 'n my head. An old\\nshe bear stood up, an' scratched them.”\\n\\nRoy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree.\\n\\n“Woods's full of big bears,” he said, grinning. “An' I take it\\nparticular kind of this old she rustlin' off with her cub. She bears\\nwith cubs are dangerous.”\\n\\nThe next place to stir Helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom\\nof this canuon. Beech trees, maples, aspens, overtopped by lofty\\npines, made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown,\\nswirling current, and leaves drifted down, and stray flecks of golden\\nsunlight lightened the gloom. Here was hard riding to and fro across the\\nbrook, between huge mossy boulders, and between aspens so close together\\nthat Helen could scarce squeeze her knees through.\\n\\nOnce more Roy climbed out of that canuon, over a ridge into another,\\ndown long wooded slopes and through scrub oak thickets, on and on\\ntill the sun stood straight overhead. Then he halted for a short rest,\\nunsaddled the horses to let them roll, and gave the girls some cold\\nlunch that he had packed. He strolled off with his gun, and, upon\\nreturning, resaddled and gave the word to start.\\n\\nThat was the last of rest and easy traveling for the girls. The forest\\nthat he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines\\nso steep of slope as to make precarious travel. Mostly he kept to the\\nbottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail. But it was necessary\\nto cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed, and this\\ncrossing was work.\\n\\nThe locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close\\nknit. They tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders. Ranger\\nappeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less.\\nBo's white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place. On\\nthe other hand, some of these steep slopes, were comparatively free of\\nunderbrush. Great firs and pines loomed up on all sides. The earth was\\nsoft and the hoofs sank deep. Toward the bottom of a descent Ranger\\nwould brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches. This\\nmode facilitated travel, but it frightened Helen. The climb out then on\\nthe other side had to be done on foot.\\n\\nAfter half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way Helen's strength was\\nspent and her breath was gone. She felt light headed. She could not get\\nenough air. Her feet felt like lead, and her riding coat was a burden.\\nA hundred times, hot and wet and throbbing, she was compelled to stop.\\nAlways she had been a splendid walker and climber. And here, to break up\\nthe long ride, she was glad to be on her feet. But she could only drag\\none foot up after the other. Then, when her nose began to bleed, she\\nrealized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble.\\nHer heart, however, did not hurt her, though she was conscious of an\\noppression on her breast.\\n\\nAt last Roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest\\nverdure that it appeared impossible to cross. Nevertheless, he started\\ndown, dismounting after a little way. Helen found that leading Ranger\\ndown was worse than riding him. He came fast and he would step right\\nin her tracks. She was not quick enough to get away from him. Twice\\nhe stepped on her foot, and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and\\nthrew her flat. When he began to slide, near the bottom, Helen had to\\nrun for her life.\\n\\n“Oh, Nell! Isn't  this  great?” panted Bo, from somewhere ahead.\\n\\n“Bo  your  mind's  gone,” panted Helen, in reply.\\n\\nRoy tried several places to climb out, and failed in each. Leading down\\nthe ravine for a hundred yards or more, he essayed another attempt.\\nHere there had been a slide, and in part the earth was bare. When he had\\nworked up this, he halted above, and called:\\n\\n“Bad place! Keep on the up side of the hosses!”\\n\\nThis appeared easier said than done. Helen could not watch Bo, because\\nRanger would not wait. He pulled at the bridle and snorted.\\n\\n“Faster you come the better,” called Roy.\\n\\nHelen could not see the sense of that, but she tried. Roy and Bo had dug\\na deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide. Helen made the mistake\\nof starting to follow in their tracks, and when she realized this Ranger\\nwas climbing fast, almost dragging her, and it was too late to get\\nabove. Helen began to labor. She slid down right in front of Ranger. The\\nintelligent animal, with a snort, plunged out of the trail to keep from\\nstepping on her. Then he was above her.\\n\\n“Lookout down there,” yelled Roy, in warning. “Get on the up side!”\\n\\nBut that did not appear possible. The earth began to slide under Ranger,\\nand that impeded Helen's progress. He got in advance of her, straining\\non the bridle.\\n\\n“Let go!” yelled Roy.\\n\\nHelen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with\\nRanger. He snorted fiercely, and, rearing high, in a mighty plunge he\\ngained solid ground. Helen was buried to her knees, but, extricating\\nherself, she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther.\\n\\n“Bad cave in, thet,” was Roy's comment, when at last she joined him and\\nBo at the top.\\n\\nRoy appeared at a loss as to which way to go. He rode to high ground and\\nlooked in all directions. To Helen, one way appeared as wild and rough\\nas another, and all was yellow, green, and black under the westering\\nsun. Roy rode a short distance in one direction, then changed for\\nanother.\\n\\nPresently he stopped.\\n\\n“Wal, I'm shore turned round,” he said.\\n\\n“You're not lost?” cried Bo.\\n\\n“Reckon I've been thet for a couple of hours,” he replied, cheerfully.\\n“Never did ride across here I had the direction, but I'm blamed now if I\\ncan tell which way thet was.”\\n\\nHelen gazed at him in consternation.\\n\\n“Lost!” she echoed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nA silence ensued, fraught with poignant fear for Helen, as she gazed\\ninto Bo's whitening face. She read her sister's mind. Bo was remembering\\ntales of lost people who never were found.\\n\\n“Me an' Milt get lost every day,” said Roy. “You don't suppose any man\\ncan know all this big country. It's nothin' for us to be lost.”\\n\\n“Oh!... I was lost when I was little,” said Bo.\\n\\n“Wal, I reckon it'd been better not to tell you so offhand like,”\\n replied Roy, contritely. “Don't feel bad, now. All I need is a peek at\\nOld Baldy. Then I'll have my bearin'. Come on.”\\n\\nHelen's confidence returned as Roy led off at a fast trot. He rode\\ntoward the westering sun, keeping to the ridge they had ascended, until\\nonce more he came out upon a promontory. Old Baldy loomed there, blacker\\nand higher and closer. The dark forest showed round, yellow, bare spots\\nlike parks.\\n\\n“Not so far off the track,” said Roy, as he wheeled his horse. “We'll\\nmake camp in Milt's senaca to night.”\\n\\nHe led down off the ridge into a valley and then up to higher altitude,\\nwhere the character of the forest changed. The trees were no longer\\npines, but firs and spruce, growing thin and exceedingly tall, with\\nfew branches below the topmost foliage. So dense was this forest that\\ntwilight seemed to have come.\\n\\nTravel was arduous. Everywhere were windfalls that had to be avoided,\\nand not a rod was there without a fallen tree. The horses, laboring\\nslowly, sometimes sank knee deep into the brown duff. Gray moss\\nfestooned the tree trunks and an amber green moss grew thick on the\\nrotting logs.\\n\\nHelen loved this forest primeval. It was so still, so dark, so gloomy,\\nso full of shadows and shade, and a dank smell of rotting wood, and\\nsweet fragrance of spruce. The great windfalls, where trees were jammed\\ntogether in dozens, showed the savagery of the storms. Wherever a single\\nmonarch lay uprooted there had sprung up a number of ambitious sons,\\njealous of one another, fighting for place. Even the trees fought one\\nanother! The forest was a place of mystery, but its strife could be read\\nby any eye. The lightnings had split firs clear to the roots, and others\\nit had circled with ripping tear from top to trunk.\\n\\nTime came, however, when the exceeding wildness of the forest, in\\ndensity and fallen timber, made it imperative for Helen to put all her\\nattention on the ground and trees in her immediate vicinity. So the\\npleasure of gazing ahead at the beautiful wilderness was denied her.\\nThereafter travel became toil and the hours endless.\\n\\nRoy led on, and Ranger followed, while the shadows darkened under the\\ntrees. She was reeling in her saddle, half blind and sick, when Roy\\ncalled out cheerily that they were almost there.\\n\\nWhatever his idea was, to Helen it seemed many miles that she followed\\nhim farther, out of the heavy timbered forest down upon slopes of low\\nspruce, like evergreen, which descended sharply to another level, where\\ndark, shallow streams flowed gently and the solemn stillness held a low\\nmurmur of falling water, and at last the wood ended upon a wonderful\\npark full of a thick, rich, golden light of fast fading sunset.\\n\\n“Smell the smoke,” said Roy. “By Solomon! if Milt ain't here ahead of\\nme!”\\n\\nHe rode on. Helen's weary gaze took in the round senaca, the circling\\nblack slopes, leading up to craggy rims all gold and red in the\\nlast flare of the sun; then all the spirit left in her flashed up in\\nthrilling wonder at this exquisite, wild, and colorful spot.\\n\\nHorses were grazing out in the long grass and there were deer grazing\\nwith them. Roy led round a corner of the fringed, bordering woodland,\\nand there, under lofty trees, shone a camp fire. Huge gray rocks loomed\\nbeyond, and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain\\nwall, over which poured a thin, lacy waterfall. As Helen gazed in\\nrapture the sunset gold faded to white and all the western slope of the\\namphitheater darkened.\\n\\nDale's tall form appeared.\\n\\n“Reckon you're late,” he said, as with a comprehensive flash of eye he\\ntook in the three.\\n\\n“Milt, I got lost,” replied Roy.\\n\\n“I feared as much... You girls look like you'd done better to ride with\\nme,” went on Dale, as he offered a hand to help Bo off. She took it,\\ntried to get her foot out of the stirrups, and then she slid from the\\nsaddle into Dale's arms. He placed her on her feet and, supporting her,\\nsaid, solicitously: “A hundred mile ride in three days for a tenderfoot\\nis somethin' your uncle Al won't believe... Come, walk if it kills\\nyou!”\\n\\nWhereupon he led Bo, very much as if he were teaching a child to walk.\\nThe fact that the voluble Bo had nothing to say was significant to\\nHelen, who was following, with the assistance of Roy.\\n\\nOne of the huge rocks resembled a sea shell in that it contained a\\nhollow over which the wide spreading shelf flared out. It reached toward\\nbranches of great pines. A spring burst from a crack in the solid rock.\\nThe campfire blazed under a pine, and the blue column of smoke rose just\\nin front of the shelving rock. Packs were lying on the grass and some\\nof them were open. There were no signs here of a permanent habitation of\\nthe hunter. But farther on were other huge rocks, leaning, cracked, and\\nforming caverns, some of which perhaps he utilized.\\n\\n“My camp is just back,” said Dale, as if he had read Helen's mind.\\n“To morrow we'll fix up comfortable like round here for you girls.”\\n\\nHelen and Bo were made as easy as blankets and saddles could make them,\\nand the men went about their tasks.\\n\\n“Nell  isn't this  a dream?” murmured Bo.\\n\\n“No, child. It's real  terribly real,” replied Helen. “Now that we're\\nhere  with that awful ride over  we can think.”\\n\\n“It's so pretty  here,” yawned Bo. “I'd just as lief Uncle Al didn't\\nfind us very soon.”\\n\\n“Bo! He's a sick man. Think what the worry will be to him.”\\n\\n“I'll bet if he knows Dale he won't be so worried.”\\n\\n“Dale told us Uncle Al disliked him.”\\n\\n“Pooh! What difference does that make?... Oh, I don't know which I\\nam  hungrier or tireder!”\\n\\n“I couldn't eat to night,” said Helen, wearily.\\n\\nWhen she stretched out she had a vague, delicious sensation that that\\nwas the end of Helen Rayner, and she was glad. Above her, through the\\nlacy, fernlike pine needles, she saw blue sky and a pale star just\\nshowing. Twilight was stealing down swiftly. The silence was beautiful,\\nseemingly undisturbed by the soft, silky, dreamy fall of water. Helen\\nclosed her eyes, ready for sleep, with the physical commotion within her\\nbody gradually yielding. In some places her bones felt as if they had\\ncome out through her flesh; in others throbbed deep seated aches; her\\nmuscles appeared slowly to subside, to relax, with the quivering twinges\\nceasing one by one; through muscle and bone, through all her body,\\npulsed a burning current.\\n\\nBo's head dropped on Helen's shoulder. Sense became vague to Helen. She\\nlost the low murmur of the waterfall, and then the sound or feeling of\\nsome one at the campfire. And her last conscious thought was that she\\ntried to open her eyes and could not.\\n\\nWhen she awoke all was bright. The sun shone almost directly overhead.\\nHelen was astounded. Bo lay wrapped in deep sleep, her face flushed,\\nwith beads of perspiration on her brow and the chestnut curls damp.\\nHelen threw down the blankets, and then, gathering courage  for she felt\\nas if her back was broken  she endeavored to sit up. In vain! Her spirit\\nwas willing, but her muscles refused to act. It must take a violent\\nspasmodic effort. She tried it with shut eyes, and, succeeding, sat\\nthere trembling. The commotion she had made in the blankets awoke Bo,\\nand she blinked her surprised blue eyes in the sunlight.\\n\\n“Hello  Nell! do I have to  get up?” she asked, sleepily.\\n\\n“Can you?” queried Helen.\\n\\n“Can I what?” Bo was now thoroughly awake and lay there staring at her\\nsister.\\n\\n“Why  get up.”\\n\\n“I'd like to know why not,” retorted Bo, as she made the effort. She got\\none arm and shoulder up, only to flop back like a crippled thing. And\\nshe uttered the most piteous little moan. “I'm dead! I know  I am!”\\n\\n“Well, if you're going to be a Western girl you'd better have spunk\\nenough to move.”\\n\\n“A huh!” ejaculated Bo. Then she rolled over, not without groans, and,\\nonce upon her face, she raised herself on her hands and turned to a\\nsitting posture. “Where's everybody?... Oh, Nell, it's perfectly lovely\\nhere. Paradise!”\\n\\nHelen looked around. A fire was smoldering. No one was in sight.\\nWonderful distant colors seemed to strike her glance as she tried to fix\\nit upon near by objects. A beautiful little green tent or shack had been\\nerected out of spruce boughs. It had a slanting roof that sloped all the\\nway from a ridge pole to the ground; half of the opening in front was\\nclosed, as were the sides. The spruce boughs appeared all to be laid in\\nthe same direction, giving it a smooth, compact appearance, actually as\\nif it had grown there.\\n\\n“That lean to wasn't there last night?” inquired Bo.\\n\\n“I didn't see it. Lean to? Where'd you get that name?”\\n\\n“It's Western, my dear. I'll bet they put it up for us... Sure, I see\\nour bags inside. Let's get up. It must be late.”\\n\\nThe girls had considerable fun as well as pain in getting up and keeping\\neach other erect until their limbs would hold them firmly. They were\\ndelighted with the spruce lean to. It faced the open and stood just\\nunder the wide spreading shelf of rock. The tiny outlet from the spring\\nflowed beside it and spilled its clear water over a stone, to fall into\\na little pool. The floor of this woodland habitation consisted of tips\\nof spruce boughs to about a foot in depth, all laid one way, smooth and\\nspringy, and so sweetly odorous that the air seemed intoxicating. Helen\\nand Bo opened their baggage, and what with use of the cold water, brush\\nand comb, and clean blouses, they made themselves feel as comfortable as\\npossible, considering the excruciating aches. Then they went out to the\\ncampfire.\\n\\nHelen's eye was attracted by moving objects near at hand. Then\\nsimultaneously with Bo's cry of delight Helen saw a beautiful doe\\napproaching under the trees. Dale walked beside it.\\n\\n“You sure had a long sleep,” was the hunter's greeting. “I reckon you\\nboth look better.”\\n\\n“Good morning. Or is it afternoon? We're just able to move about,” said\\nHelen.\\n\\n“I could ride,” declared Bo, stoutly. “Oh, Nell, look at the deer! It's\\ncoming to me.”\\n\\nThe doe had hung back a little as Dale reached the camp fire. It was a\\ngray, slender creature, smooth as silk, with great dark eyes. It stood a\\nmoment, long ears erect, and then with a graceful little trot came up\\nto Bo and reached a slim nose for her outstretched hand. All about it,\\nexcept the beautiful soft eyes, seemed wild, and yet it was as tame as\\na kitten. Then, suddenly, as Bo fondled the long ears, it gave a start\\nand, breaking away, ran back out of sight under the pines.\\n\\n“What frightened it?” asked Bo.\\n\\nDale pointed up at the wall under the shelving roof of rock. There,\\ntwenty feet from the ground, curled up on a ledge, lay a huge tawny\\nanimal with a face like that of a cat.\\n\\n“She's afraid of Tom,” replied Dale. “Recognizes him as a hereditary\\nfoe, I guess. I can't make friends of them.”\\n\\n“Oh! So that's Tom  the pet lion!” exclaimed Bo. “Ugh! No wonder that\\ndeer ran off!”\\n\\n“How long has he been up there?” queried Helen, gazing fascinated at\\nDale's famous pet.\\n\\n“I couldn't say. Tom comes an' goes,” replied Dale. “But I sent him up\\nthere last night.”\\n\\n“And he was there  perfectly free  right over us  while we slept!” burst\\nout Bo.\\n\\n“Yes. An' I reckon you slept the safer for that.”\\n\\n“Of all things! Nell, isn't he a monster? But he doesn't look like a\\nlion  an African lion. He's a panther. I saw his like at the circus\\nonce.”\\n\\n“He's a cougar,” said Dale. “The panther is long and slim. Tom is not\\nonly long, but thick an' round. I've had him four years. An' he was a\\nkitten no bigger 'n my fist when I got him.”\\n\\n“Is he perfectly tame  safe?” asked Helen, anxiously.\\n\\n“I've never told anybody that Tom was safe, but he is,” replied Dale.\\n“You can absolutely believe it. A wild cougar wouldn't attack a man\\nunless cornered or starved. An' Tom is like a big kitten.”\\n\\nThe beast raised his great catlike face, with its sleepy, half shut\\neyes, and looked down upon them.\\n\\n“Shall I call him down?” inquired Dale.\\n\\nFor once Bo did not find her voice.\\n\\n“Let us  get a little more used to him  at a distance,” replied Helen,\\nwith a little laugh.\\n\\n“If he comes to you, just rub his head an' you'll see how tame he is,”\\n said Dale. “Reckon you're both hungry?”\\n\\n“Not so very,” returned Helen, aware of his penetrating gray gaze upon\\nher.\\n\\n“Well, I am,” vouchsafed Bo.\\n\\n“Soon as the turkey's done we'll eat. My camp is round between the\\nrocks. I'll call you.”\\n\\nNot until his broad back was turned did Helen notice that the hunter\\nlooked different. Then she saw he wore a lighter, cleaner suit of\\nbuckskin, with no coat, and instead of the high heeled horseman's boots\\nhe wore moccasins and leggings. The change made him appear more lithe.\\n\\n“Nell, I don't know what you think, but I call him handsome,” declared\\nBo.\\n\\nHelen had no idea what she thought.\\n\\n“Let's try to walk some,” she suggested.\\n\\nSo they essayed that painful task and got as far as a pine log some few\\nrods from their camp. This point was close to the edge of the park, from\\nwhich there was an unobstructed view.\\n\\n“My! What a place!” exclaimed Bo, with eyes wide and round.\\n\\n“Oh, beautiful!” breathed Helen.\\n\\nAn unexpected blaze of color drew her gaze first. Out of the black\\nspruce slopes shone patches of aspens, gloriously red and gold, and low\\ndown along the edge of timber troops of aspens ran out into the park,\\nnot yet so blazing as those above, but purple and yellow and white in\\nthe sunshine. Masses of silver spruce, like trees in moonlight, bordered\\nthe park, sending out here and there an isolated tree, sharp as a\\nspear, with under branches close to the ground. Long golden green grass,\\nresembling half ripe wheat, covered the entire floor of the park, gently\\nwaving to the wind. Above sheered the black, gold patched slopes, steep\\nand unscalable, rising to buttresses of dark, iron hued rock. And to\\nthe east circled the rows of cliff bench, gray and old and fringed,\\nsplitting at the top in the notch where the lacy, slumberous waterfall,\\nlike white smoke, fell and vanished, to reappear in wider sheet of lace,\\nonly to fall and vanish again in the green depths.\\n\\nIt was a verdant valley, deep set in the mountain walls, wild and sad\\nand lonesome. The waterfall dominated the spirit of the place, dreamy\\nand sleepy and tranquil; it murmured sweetly on one breath of wind, and\\nlulled with another, and sometimes died out altogether, only to come\\nagain in soft, strange roar.\\n\\n“Paradise Park!” whispered Bo to herself.\\n\\nA call from Dale disturbed their raptures. Turning, they hobbled with\\neager but painful steps in the direction of a larger camp fire, situated\\nto the right of the great rock that sheltered their lean to. No hut or\\nhouse showed there and none was needed. Hiding places and homes for a\\nhundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs, split off\\nin bygone ages from the mountain wall above. A few stately pines stood\\nout from the rocks, and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown\\nbrook. This camp was only a step from the lean to, round the corner of\\na huge rock, yet it had been out of sight. Here indeed was evidence of\\na hunter's home  pelts and skins and antlers, a neat pile of split\\nfire wood, a long ledge of rock, well sheltered, and loaded with\\nbags like a huge pantry shelf, packs and ropes and saddles, tools and\\nweapons, and a platform of dry brush as shelter for a fire around which\\nhung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp.\\n\\n“Hyar  you git!” shouted Dale, and he threw a stick at something. A bear\\ncub scampered away in haste. He was small and woolly and brown, and he\\ngrunted as he ran. Soon he halted.\\n\\n“That's Bud,” said Dale, as the girls came up. “Guess he near starved in\\nmy absence. An' now he wants everythin', especially the sugar. We don't\\nhave sugar often up here.”\\n\\n“Isn't he dear? Oh, I love him!” cried Bo. “Come back, Bud. Come,\\nBuddie.”\\n\\nThe cub, however, kept his distance, watching Dale with bright little\\neyes.\\n\\n“Where's Mr. Roy?” asked Helen.\\n\\n“Roy's gone. He was sorry not to say good by. But it's important he gets\\ndown in the pines on Anson's trail. He'll hang to Anson, an' in case\\nthey get near Pine he'll ride in to see where your uncle is.”\\n\\n“What do you expect?” questioned Helen, gravely.\\n\\n“'Most anythin',” he replied. “Al, I reckon, knows now. Maybe he's\\nrustlin' into the mountains by this time. If he meets up with Anson,\\nwell an' good, for Roy won't be far off. An' sure if he runs across Roy,\\nwhy they'll soon be here. But if I were you I wouldn't count on seein'\\nyour uncle very soon. I'm sorry. I've done my best. It sure is a bad\\ndeal.”\\n\\n“Don't think me ungracious,” replied Helen, hastily. How plainly he\\nhad intimated that it must be privation and annoyance for her to be\\ncompelled to accept his hospitality! “You are good  kind. I owe you\\nmuch. I'll be eternally grateful.”\\n\\nDale straightened as he looked at her. His glance was intent, piercing.\\nHe seemed to be receiving a strange or unusual portent. No need for him\\nto say he had never before been spoken to like that!\\n\\n“You may have to stay here with me  for weeks  maybe months  if we've\\nthe bad luck to get snowed in,” he said, slowly, as if startled at this\\ndeduction. “You're safe here. No sheep thief could ever find this camp.\\nI'll take risks to get you safe into Al's hands. But I'm goin' to be\\npretty sure about what I'm doin'... So  there's plenty to eat an' it's\\na pretty place.”\\n\\n“Pretty! Why, it's grand!” exclaimed Bo. “I've called it Paradise Park.”\\n\\n“Paradise Park,” he repeated, weighing the words. “You've named it an'\\nalso the creek. Paradise Creek! I've been here twelve years with no fit\\nname for my home till you said that.”\\n\\n“Oh, that pleases me!” returned Bo, with shining eyes.\\n\\n“Eat now,” said Dale. “An' I reckon you'll like that turkey.”\\n\\nThere was a clean tarpaulin upon which were spread steaming, fragrant\\npans  roast turkey, hot biscuits and gravy, mashed potatoes as white as\\nif prepared at home, stewed dried apples, and butter and coffee. This\\nbounteous repast surprised and delighted the girls; when they had once\\ntasted the roast wild turkey, then Milt Dale had occasion to blush at\\ntheir encomiums.\\n\\n“I hope  Uncle Al  doesn't come for a month,” declared Bo, as she tried\\nto get her breath. There was a brown spot on her nose and one on each\\ncheek, suspiciously close to her mouth.\\n\\nDale laughed. It was pleasant to hear him, for his laugh seemed unused\\nand deep, as if it came from tranquil depths.\\n\\n“Won't you eat with us?” asked Helen.\\n\\n“Reckon I will,” he said, “it'll save time, an' hot grub tastes better.”\\n\\nQuite an interval of silence ensued, which presently was broken by Dale.\\n\\n“Here comes Tom.”\\n\\nHelen observed with a thrill that the cougar was magnificent, seen erect\\non all fours, approaching with slow, sinuous grace. His color was tawny,\\nwith spots of whitish gray. He had bow legs, big and round and furry,\\nand a huge head with great tawny eyes. No matter how tame he was said\\nto be, he looked wild. Like a dog he walked right up, and it so happened\\nthat he was directly behind Bo, within reach of her when she turned.\\n\\n“Oh, Lord!” cried Bo, and up went both of her hands, in one of which\\nwas a huge piece of turkey. Tom took it, not viciously, but nevertheless\\nwith a snap that made Helen jump. As if by magic the turkey vanished.\\nAnd Tom took a closer step toward Bo. Her expression of fright changed\\nto consternation.\\n\\n“He stole my turkey!”\\n\\n“Tom, come here,” ordered Dale, sharply. The cougar glided round rather\\nsheepishly. “Now lie down an' behave.”\\n\\nTom crouched on all fours, his head resting on his paws, with his\\nbeautiful tawny eyes, light and piercing, fixed upon the hunter.\\n\\n“Don't grab,” said Dale, holding out a piece of turkey. Whereupon Tom\\ntook it less voraciously.\\n\\nAs it happened, the little bear cub saw this transaction, and he plainly\\nindicated his opinion of the preference shown to Tom.\\n\\n“Oh, the dear!” exclaimed Bo. “He means it's not fair... Come,\\nBud  come on.”\\n\\nBut Bud would not approach the group until called by Dale. Then he\\nscrambled to them with every manifestation of delight. Bo almost forgot\\nher own needs in feeding him and getting acquainted with him. Tom\\nplainly showed his jealousy of Bud, and Bud likewise showed his fear of\\nthe great cat.\\n\\nHelen could not believe the evidence of her eyes  that she was in the\\nwoods calmly and hungrily partaking of sweet, wild flavored meat  that\\na full grown mountain lion lay on one side of her and a baby brown bear\\nsat on the other  that a strange hunter, a man of the forest, there in\\nhis lonely and isolated fastness, appealed to the romance in her and\\ninterested her as no one else she had ever met.\\n\\nWhen the wonderful meal was at last finished Bo enticed the bear cub\\naround to the camp of the girls, and there soon became great comrades\\nwith him. Helen, watching Bo play, was inclined to envy her. No matter\\nwhere Bo was placed, she always got something out of it. She adapted\\nherself. She, who could have a good time with almost any one or\\nanything, would find the hours sweet and fleeting in this beautiful park\\nof wild wonders.\\n\\nBut merely objective actions  merely physical movements, had never yet\\ncontented Helen. She could run and climb and ride and play with hearty\\nand healthy abandon, but those things would not suffice long for her,\\nand her mind needed food. Helen was a thinker. One reason she had\\ndesired to make her home in the West was that by taking up a life of the\\nopen, of action, she might think and dream and brood less. And here she\\nwas in the wild West, after the three most strenuously active days of\\nher career, and still the same old giant revolved her mind and turned it\\nupon herself and upon all she saw.\\n\\n“What can I do?” she asked Bo, almost helplessly.\\n\\n“Why, rest, you silly!” retorted Bo. “You walk like an old, crippled\\nwoman with only one leg.”\\n\\nHelen hoped the comparison was undeserved, but the advice was sound.\\nThe blankets spread out on the grass looked inviting and they felt\\ncomfortably warm in the sunshine. The breeze was slow, languorous,\\nfragrant, and it brought the low hum of the murmuring waterfall, like\\na melody of bees. Helen made a pillow and lay down to rest. The green\\npine needles, so thin and fine in their crisscross network, showed\\nclearly against the blue sky. She looked in vain for birds. Then\\nher gaze went wonderingly to the lofty fringed rim of the great\\namphitheater, and as she studied it she began to grasp its remoteness,\\nhow far away it was in the rarefied atmosphere. A black eagle, sweeping\\nalong, looked of tiny size, and yet he was far under the heights above.\\nHow pleasant she fancied it to be up there! And drowsy fancy lulled her\\nto sleep.\\n\\nHelen slept all afternoon, and upon awakening, toward sunset, found Bo\\ncurled beside her. Dale had thoughtfully covered them with a blanket;\\nalso he had built a camp fire. The air was growing keen and cold.\\n\\nLater, when they had put their coats on and made comfortable seats\\nbeside the fire, Dale came over, apparently to visit them.\\n\\n“I reckon you can't sleep all the time,” he said. “An' bein' city girls,\\nyou'll get lonesome.”\\n\\n“Lonesome!” echoed Helen. The idea of her being lonesome here had not\\noccurred to her.\\n\\n“I've thought that all out,” went on Dale, as he sat down, Indian\\nfashion, before the blaze. “It's natural you'd find time drag up here,\\nbein' used to lots of people an' goin's on, an' work, an' all girls\\nlike.”\\n\\n“I'd never be lonesome here,” replied Helen, with her direct force.\\n\\nDale did not betray surprise, but he showed that his mistake was\\nsomething to ponder over.\\n\\n“Excuse me,” he said, presently, as his gray eyes held hers. “That's\\nhow I had it. As I remember girls  an' it doesn't seem long since I left\\nhome  most of them would die of lonesomeness up here.” Then he addressed\\nhimself to Bo. “How about you? You see, I figured you'd be the one that\\nliked it, an' your sister the one who wouldn't.”\\n\\n“I won't get lonesome very soon,” replied Bo.\\n\\n“I'm glad. It worried me some  not ever havin' girls as company before.\\nAn' in a day or so, when you're rested, I'll help you pass the time.”\\n\\nBo's eyes were full of flashing interest, and Helen asked him, “How?”\\n\\nIt was a sincere expression of her curiosity and not doubtful or\\nironic challenge of an educated woman to a man of the forest. But as a\\nchallenge he took it.\\n\\n“How!” he repeated, and a strange smile flitted across his face. “Why,\\nby givin' you rides an' climbs to beautiful places. An' then, if you're\\ninterested,' to show you how little so called civilized people know of\\nnature.”\\n\\nHelen realized then that whatever his calling, hunter or wanderer or\\nhermit, he was not uneducated, even if he appeared illiterate.\\n\\n“I'll be happy to learn from you,” she said.\\n\\n“Me, too!” chimed in Bo. “You can't tell too much to any one from\\nMissouri.”\\n\\nHe smiled, and that warmed Helen to him, for then he seemed less removed\\nfrom other people. About this hunter there began to be something of the\\nvery nature of which he spoke  a stillness, aloofness, an unbreakable\\ntranquillity, a cold, clear spirit like that in the mountain air, a\\nphysical something not unlike the tamed wildness of his pets or the\\nstrength of the pines.\\n\\n“I'll bet I can tell you more 'n you'll ever remember,” he said.\\n\\n“What 'll you bet?” retorted Bo.\\n\\n“Well, more roast turkey against  say somethin' nice when you're safe\\nan' home to your uncle Al's, runnin' his ranch.”\\n\\n“Agreed. Nell, you hear?”\\n\\nHelen nodded her head.\\n\\n“All right. We'll leave it to Nell,” began Dale, half seriously. “Now\\nI'll tell you, first, for the fun of passin' time we'll ride an' race\\nmy horses out in the park. An' we'll fish in the brooks an' hunt in the\\nwoods. There's an old silvertip around that you can see me kill. An'\\nwe'll climb to the peaks an' see wonderful sights... So much for\\nthat. Now, if you really want to learn  or if you only want me to tell\\nyou  well, that's no matter. Only I'll win the bet!... You'll see\\nhow this park lies in the crater of a volcano an' was once full of\\nwater  an' how the snow blows in on one side in winter, a hundred feet\\ndeep, when there's none on the other. An' the trees  how they grow an'\\nlive an' fight one another an' depend on one another, an' protect\\nthe forest from storm winds. An' how they hold the water that is the\\nfountains of the great rivers. An' how the creatures an' things that\\nlive in them or on them are good for them, an' neither could live\\nwithout the other. An' then I'll show you my pets tame an' untamed, an'\\ntell you how it's man that makes any creature wild  how easy they are\\nto tame  an' how they learn to love you. An' there's the life of the\\nforest, the strife of it  how the bear lives, an' the cats, an' the\\nwolves, an' the deer. You'll see how cruel nature is how savage an'\\nwild the wolf or cougar tears down the deer  how a wolf loves fresh, hot\\nblood, an' how a cougar unrolls the skin of a deer back from his neck.\\nAn' you'll see that this cruelty of nature  this work of the wolf an'\\ncougar  is what makes the deer so beautiful an' healthy an' swift an'\\nsensitive. Without his deadly foes the deer would deteriorate an' die\\nout. An' you'll see how this principle works out among all creatures of\\nthe forest. Strife! It's the meanin' of all creation, an' the salvation.\\nIf you're quick to see, you'll learn that the nature here in the wilds\\nis the same as that of men  only men are no longer cannibals. Trees\\nfight to live  birds fight  animals fight  men fight. They all live\\noff one another. An' it's this fightin' that brings them all closer an'\\ncloser to bein' perfect. But nothin' will ever be perfect.”\\n\\n“But how about religion?” interrupted Helen, earnestly.\\n\\n“Nature has a religion, an' it's to live  to grow  to reproduce, each of\\nits kind.”\\n\\n“But that is not God or the immortality of the soul,” declared Helen.\\n\\n“Well, it's as close to God an' immortality as nature ever gets.”\\n\\n“Oh, you would rob me of my religion!”\\n\\n“No, I just talk as I see life,” replied Dale, reflectively, as he poked\\na stick into the red embers of the fire. “Maybe I have a religion. I\\ndon't know. But it's not the kind you have  not the Bible kind. That\\nkind doesn't keep the men in Pine an' Snowdrop an' all over  sheepmen\\nan' ranchers an' farmers an' travelers, such as I've known  the religion\\nthey profess doesn't keep them from lyin', cheatin', stealin', an'\\nkillin'. I reckon no man who lives as I do  which perhaps is my\\nreligion  will lie or cheat or steal or kill, unless it's to kill in\\nself defense or like I'd do if Snake Anson would ride up here now.\\nMy religion, maybe, is love of life  wild life as it was in the\\nbeginnin'  an' the wind that blows secrets from everywhere, an' the\\nwater that sings all day an' night, an' the stars that shine constant,\\nan' the trees that speak somehow, an' the rocks that aren't dead. I'm\\nnever alone here or on the trails. There's somethin' unseen, but always\\nwith me. An' that's It! Call it God if you like. But what stalls me\\nis  where was that Spirit when this earth was a ball of fiery gas? Where\\nwill that Spirit be when all life is frozen out or burned out on this\\nglobe an' it hangs dead in space like the moon? That time will come.\\nThere's no waste in nature. Not the littlest atom is destroyed. It\\nchanges, that's all, as you see this pine wood go up in smoke an' feel\\nsomethin' that's heat come out of it. Where does that go? It's not lost.\\nNothin' is lost. So, the beautiful an' savin' thought is, maybe all\\nrock an' wood, water an' blood an' flesh, are resolved back into the\\nelements, to come to life somewhere again sometime.”\\n\\n“Oh, what you say is wonderful, but it's terrible!” exclaimed Helen. He\\nhad struck deep into her soul.\\n\\n“Terrible? I reckon,” he replied, sadly.\\n\\nThen ensued a little interval of silence.\\n\\n“Milt Dale, I lose the bet,” declared Bo, with earnestness behind her\\nfrivolity.\\n\\n“I'd forgotten that. Reckon I talked a lot,” he said, apologetically.\\n“You see, I don't get much chance to talk, except to myself or Tom.\\nYears ago, when I found the habit of silence settlin' down on me, I took\\nto thinkin' out loud an' talkin' to anythin'.”\\n\\n“I could listen to you all night,” returned Bo, dreamily.\\n\\n“Do you read  do you have books?” inquired Helen, suddenly.\\n\\n“Yes, I read tolerable well; a good deal better than I talk or write,”\\n he replied. “I went to school till I was fifteen. Always hated study,\\nbut liked to read. Years ago an old friend of mine down here at\\nPine  Widow Cass  she gave me a lot of old books. An' I packed them up\\nhere. Winter's the time I read.”\\n\\nConversation lagged after that, except for desultory remarks, and\\npresently Dale bade the girls good night and left them. Helen watched\\nhis tall form vanish in the gloom under the pines, and after he had\\ndisappeared she still stared.\\n\\n“Nell!” called Bo, shrilly. “I've called you three times. I want to go\\nto bed.”\\n\\n“Oh! I  I was thinking,” rejoined Helen, half embarrassed, half\\nwondering at herself. “I didn't hear you.”\\n\\n“I should smile you didn't,” retorted Bo. “Wish you could just have seen\\nyour eyes. Nell, do you want me to tell you something?\\n\\n“Why  yes,” said Helen, rather feebly. She did not at all, when Bo\\ntalked like that.\\n\\n“You're going to fall in love with that wild hunter,” declared Bo in a\\nvoice that rang like a bell.\\n\\nHelen was not only amazed, but enraged. She caught her breath\\npreparatory to giving this incorrigible sister a piece of her mind. Bo\\nwent calmly on.\\n\\n“I can feel it in my bones.”\\n\\n“Bo, you're a little fool  a sentimental, romancing, gushy little fool!”\\n retorted Helen. “All you seem to hold in your head is some rot about\\nlove. To hear you talk one would think there's nothing else in the world\\nbut love.”\\n\\nBo's eyes were bright, shrewd, affectionate, and laughing as she bent\\ntheir steady gaze upon Helen.\\n\\n“Nell, that's just it. There IS nothing else!”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nThe night of sleep was so short that it was difficult for Helen to\\nbelieve that hours had passed. Bo appeared livelier this morning, with\\nless complaint of aches.\\n\\n“Nell, you've got color!” exclaimed Bo. “And your eyes are bright. Isn't\\nthe morning perfectly lovely?... Couldn't you get drunk on that air? I\\nsmell flowers. And oh! I'm hungry!”\\n\\n“Bo, our host will soon have need of his hunting abilities if your\\nappetite holds,” said Helen, as she tried to keep her hair out of her\\neyes while she laced her boots.\\n\\n“Look! there's a big dog  a hound.”\\n\\nHelen looked as Bo directed, and saw a hound of unusually large\\nproportions, black and tan in color, with long, drooping ears. Curiously\\nhe trotted nearer to the door of their hut and then stopped to gaze at\\nthem. His head was noble, his eyes shone dark and sad. He seemed neither\\nfriendly nor unfriendly.\\n\\n“Hello, doggie! Come right in  we won't hurt you,” called Bo, but\\nwithout enthusiasm.\\n\\nThis made Helen laugh. “Bo, you're simply delicious,” she said. “You're\\nafraid of that dog.”\\n\\n“Sure. Wonder if he's Dale's. Of course he must be.”\\n\\nPresently the hound trotted away out of sight. When the girls presented\\nthemselves at the camp fire they espied their curious canine visitor\\nlying down. His ears were so long that half of them lay on the ground.\\n\\n“I sent Pedro over to wake you girls up,” said Dale, after greeting\\nthem. “Did he scare you?”\\n\\n“Pedro. So that's his name. No, he didn't exactly scare me. He did Nell,\\nthough. She's an awful tenderfoot,” replied Bo.\\n\\n“He's a splendid looking dog,” said Helen, ignoring her sister's sally.\\n“I love dogs. Will he make friends?”\\n\\n“He's shy an' wild. You see, when I leave camp he won't hang around. He\\nan' Tom are jealous of each other. I had a pack of hounds an' lost all\\nbut Pedro on account of Tom. I think you can make friends with Pedro.\\nTry it.”\\n\\nWhereupon Helen made overtures to Pedro, and not wholly in vain. The\\ndog was matured, of almost stern aloofness, and manifestly not used to\\npeople. His deep, wine dark eyes seemed to search Helen's soul. They\\nwere honest and wise, with a strange sadness.\\n\\n“He looks intelligent,” observed Helen, as she smoothed the long, dark\\nears.\\n\\n“That hound is nigh human,” responded Dale. “Come, an' while you eat\\nI'll tell you about Pedro.”\\n\\nDale had gotten the hound as a pup from a Mexican sheep herder who\\nclaimed he was part California bloodhound. He grew up, becoming attached\\nto Dale. In his younger days he did not get along well with Dale's other\\npets and Dale gave him to a rancher down in the valley. Pedro was back\\nin Dale's camp next day. From that day Dale began to care more for the\\nhound, but he did not want to keep him, for various reasons, chief of\\nwhich was the fact that Pedro was too fine a dog to be left alone half\\nthe time to shift for himself. That fall Dale had need to go to the\\nfarthest village, Snowdrop, where he left Pedro with a friend. Then Dale\\nrode to Show Down and Pine, and the camp of the Beemans' and with them\\nhe trailed some wild horses for a hundred miles, over into New Mexico.\\nThe snow was flying when Dale got back to his camp in the mountains.\\nAnd there was Pedro, gaunt and worn, overjoyed to welcome him home. Roy\\nBeeman visited Dale that October and told that Dale's friend in Snowdrop\\nhad not been able to keep Pedro. He broke a chain and scaled a ten foot\\nfence to escape. He trailed Dale to Show Down, where one of Dale's\\nfriends, recognizing the hound, caught him, and meant to keep him until\\nDale's return. But Pedro refused to eat. It happened that a freighter\\nwas going out to the Beeman camp, and Dale's friend boxed Pedro up and\\nput him on the wagon. Pedro broke out of the box, returned to Show Down,\\ntook up Dale's trail to Pine, and then on to the Beeman camp. That was\\nas far as Roy could trace the movements of the hound. But he believed,\\nand so did Dale, that Pedro had trailed them out on the wild horse hunt.\\nThe following spring Dale learned more from the herder of a sheepman at\\nwhose camp he and the Beemans; had rested on the way into New Mexico.\\nIt appeared that after Dale had left this camp Pedro had arrived, and\\nanother Mexican herder had stolen the hound. But Pedro got away.\\n\\n“An' he was here when I arrived,” concluded Dale, smiling. “I never\\nwanted to get rid of him after that. He's turned out to be the finest\\ndog I ever knew. He knows what I say. He can almost talk. An' I swear he\\ncan cry. He does whenever I start off without him.”\\n\\n“How perfectly wonderful!” exclaimed Bo. “Aren't animals great?... But I\\nlove horses best.”\\n\\nIt seemed to Helen that Pedro understood they were talking about him,\\nfor he looked ashamed, and swallowed hard, and dropped his gaze. She\\nknew something of the truth about the love of dogs for their owners.\\nThis story of Dale's, however, was stranger than any she had ever heard.\\n\\nTom, the cougar, put in an appearance then, and there was scarcely love\\nin the tawny eyes he bent upon Pedro. But the hound did not deign to\\nnotice him. Tom sidled up to Bo, who sat on the farther side of the\\ntarpaulin table cloth, and manifestly wanted part of her breakfast.\\n\\n“Gee! I love the look of him,” she said. “But when he's close he makes\\nmy flesh creep.”\\n\\n“Beasts are as queer as people,” observed Dale. “They take likes an'\\ndislikes. I believe Tom has taken a shine to you an' Pedro begins to be\\ninterested in your sister. I can tell.”\\n\\n“Where's Bud?” inquired Bo.\\n\\n“He's asleep or around somewhere. Now, soon as I get the work done, what\\nwould you girls like to do?”\\n\\n“Ride!” declared Bo, eagerly.\\n\\n“Aren't you sore an' stiff?”\\n\\n“I am that. But I don't care. Besides, when I used to go out to my\\nuncle's farm near Saint Joe I always found riding to be a cure for\\naches.”\\n\\n“Sure is, if you can stand it. An' what will your sister like to do?”\\n returned Dale, turning to Helen.\\n\\n“Oh, I'll rest, and watch you folks  and dream,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“But after you've rested you must be active,” said Dale, seriously. “You\\nmust do things. It doesn't matter what, just as long as you don't sit\\nidle.”\\n\\n“Why?” queried Helen, in surprise. “Why not be idle here in this\\nbeautiful, wild place? just to dream away the hours  the days! I could\\ndo it.”\\n\\n“But you mustn't. It took me years to learn how bad that was for me. An'\\nright now I would love nothin' more than to forget my work, my horses\\nan' pets  everythin', an' just lay around, seein' an' feelin'.”\\n\\n“Seeing and feeling? Yes, that must be what I mean. But why  what is\\nit? There are the beauty and color  the wild, shaggy slopes  the gray\\ncliffs  the singing wind  the lulling water  the clouds  the sky. And\\nthe silence, loneliness, sweetness of it all.”\\n\\n“It's a driftin' back. What I love to do an' yet fear most. It's what\\nmakes a lone hunter of a man. An' it can grow so strong that it binds a\\nman to the wilds.”\\n\\n“How strange!” murmured Helen. “But that could never bind ME. Why, I\\nmust live and fulfil my mission, my work in the civilized world.”\\n\\nIt seemed to Helen that Dale almost imperceptibly shrank at her earnest\\nwords.\\n\\n“The ways of Nature are strange,” he said. “I look at it different.\\nNature's just as keen to wean you back to a savage state as you are to\\nbe civilized. An' if Nature won, you would carry out her design all the\\nbetter.”\\n\\nThis hunter's talk shocked Helen and yet stimulated her mind.\\n\\n“Me  a savage? Oh no!” she exclaimed. “But, if that were possible, what\\nwould Nature's design be?”\\n\\n“You spoke of your mission in life,” he replied. “A woman's mission is\\nto have children. The female of any species has only one mission  to\\nreproduce its kind. An' Nature has only one mission  toward greater\\nstrength, virility, efficiency  absolute perfection, which is\\nunattainable.”\\n\\n“What of mental and spiritual development of man and woman?” asked\\nHelen.\\n\\n“Both are direct obstacles to the design of Nature. Nature is physical.\\nTo create for limitless endurance for eternal life. That must be\\nNature's inscrutable design. An' why she must fail.”\\n\\n“But the soul!” whispered Helen.\\n\\n“Ah! When you speak of the soul an' I speak of life we mean the same.\\nYou an' I will have some talks while you're here. I must brush up my\\nthoughts.”\\n\\n“So must I, it seems,” said Helen, with a slow smile. She had been\\nrendered grave and thoughtful. “But I guess I'll risk dreaming under the\\npines.”\\n\\nBo had been watching them with her keen blue eyes.\\n\\n“Nell, it'd take a thousand years to make a savage of you,” she said.\\n“But a week will do for me.”\\n\\n“Bo, you were one before you left Saint Joe,” replied Helen. “Don't you\\nremember that school teacher Barnes who said you were a wildcat and an\\nIndian mixed? He spanked you with a ruler.”\\n\\n“Never! He missed me,” retorted Bo, with red in her cheeks. “Nell, I\\nwish you'd not tell things about me when I was a kid.”\\n\\n“That was only two years ago,” expostulated Helen, in mild surprise.\\n\\n“Suppose it was. I was a kid all right. I'll bet you  ” Bo broke up\\nabruptly, and, tossing her head, she gave Tom a pat and then ran away\\naround the corner of cliff wall.\\n\\nHelen followed leisurely.\\n\\n“Say, Nell,” said Bo, when Helen arrived at their little green\\nledge pole hut, “do you know that hunter fellow will upset some of your\\ntheories?”\\n\\n“Maybe. I'll admit he amazes me  and affronts me, too, I'm afraid,”\\n replied Helen. “What surprises me is that in spite of his evident lack\\nof schooling he's not raw or crude. He's elemental.”\\n\\n“Sister dear, wake up. The man's wonderful. You can learn more from\\nhim than you ever learned in your life. So can I. I always hated books,\\nanyway.”\\n\\nWhen, a little later, Dale approached carrying some bridles, the hound\\nPedro trotted at his heels.\\n\\n“I reckon you'd better ride the horse you had,” he said to Bo.\\n\\n“Whatever you say. But I hope you let me ride them all, by and by.”\\n\\n“Sure. I've a mustang out there you'll like. But he pitches a little,”\\n he rejoined, and turned away toward the park. The hound looked after him\\nand then at Helen.\\n\\n“Come, Pedro. Stay with me,” called Helen.\\n\\nDale, hearing her, motioned the hound back. Obediently Pedro trotted to\\nher, still shy and soberly watchful, as if not sure of her intentions,\\nbut with something of friendliness about him now. Helen found a soft,\\nrestful seat in the sun facing the park, and there composed herself for\\nwhat she felt would be slow, sweet, idle hours. Pedro curled down beside\\nher. The tall form of Dale stalked across the park, out toward the\\nstraggling horses. Again she saw a deer grazing among them. How erect\\nand motionless it stood watching Dale! Presently it bounded away toward\\nthe edge of the forest. Some of the horses whistled and ran, kicking\\nheels high in the air. The shrill whistles rang clear in the stillness.\\n\\n“Gee! Look at them go!” exclaimed Bo, gleefully, coming up to where\\nHelen sat. Bo threw herself down upon the fragrant pine needles and\\nstretched herself languorously, like a lazy kitten. There was something\\nfeline in her lithe, graceful outline. She lay flat and looked up\\nthrough the pines.\\n\\n“Wouldn't it be great, now,” she murmured, dreamily, half to herself,\\n“if that Las Vegas cowboy would happen somehow to come, and then an\\nearthquake would shut us up here in this Paradise valley so we'd never\\nget out?”\\n\\n“Bo! What would mother say to such talk as that?” gasped Helen.\\n\\n“But, Nell, wouldn't it be great?”\\n\\n“It would be terrible.”\\n\\n“Oh, there never was any romance in you, Nell Rayner,” replied Bo. “That\\nvery thing has actually happened out here in this wonderful country\\nof wild places. You need not tell me! Sure it's happened. With the\\ncliff dwellers and the Indians and then white people. Every place I look\\nmakes me feel that. Nell, you'd have to see people in the moon through a\\ntelescope before you'd believe that.”\\n\\n“I'm practical and sensible, thank goodness!”\\n\\n“But, for the sake of argument,” protested Bo, with flashing eyes,\\n“suppose it MIGHT happen. Just to please me, suppose we DID get shut up\\nhere with Dale and that cowboy we saw from the train. Shut in without\\nany hope of ever climbing out... What would you do? Would you give up\\nand pine away and die? Or would you fight for life and whatever joy it\\nmight mean?”\\n\\n“Self preservation is the first instinct,” replied Helen, surprised at\\na strange, deep thrill in the depths of her. “I'd fight for life, of\\ncourse.”\\n\\n“Yes. Well, really, when I think seriously I don't want anything like\\nthat to happen. But, just the same, if it DID happen I would glory in\\nit.”\\n\\nWhile they were talking Dale returned with the horses.\\n\\n“Can you bridle an' saddle your own horse?” he asked.\\n\\n“No. I'm ashamed to say I can't,” replied Bo.\\n\\n“Time to learn then. Come on. Watch me first when I saddle mine.”\\n\\nBo was all eyes while Dale slipped off the bridle from his horse and\\nthen with slow, plain action readjusted it. Next he smoothed the back of\\nthe horse, shook out the blanket, and, folding it half over, he threw\\nit in place, being careful to explain to Bo just the right position. He\\nlifted his saddle in a certain way and put that in place, and then he\\ntightened the cinches.\\n\\n“Now you try,” he said.\\n\\nAccording to Helen's judgment Bo might have been a Western girl all her\\ndays. But Dale shook his head and made her do it over.\\n\\n“That was better. Of course, the saddle is too heavy for you to sling\\nit up. You can learn that with a light one. Now put the bridle on\\nagain. Don't be afraid of your hands. He won't bite. Slip the bit in\\nsideways... There. Now let's see you mount.”\\n\\nWhen Bo got into the saddle Dale continued: “You went up quick an'\\nlight, but the wrong way. Watch me.”\\n\\nBo had to mount several times before Dale was satisfied. Then he told\\nher to ride off a little distance. When Bo had gotten out of earshot\\nDale said to Helen: “She'll take to a horse like a duck takes to water.”\\n Then, mounting, he rode out after her.\\n\\nHelen watched them trotting and galloping and running the horses round\\nthe grassy park, and rather regretted she had not gone with them.\\nEventually Bo rode back, to dismount and fling herself down, red cheeked\\nand radiant, with disheveled hair, and curls damp on her temples. How\\nalive she seemed! Helen's senses thrilled with the grace and charm\\nand vitality of this surprising sister, and she was aware of a sheer\\nphysical joy in her presence. Bo rested, but she did not rest long. She\\nwas soon off to play with Bud. Then she coaxed the tame doe to eat\\nout of her hand. She dragged Helen off for wild flowers, curious and\\nthoughtless by turns. And at length she fell asleep, quickly, in a way\\nthat reminded Helen of the childhood now gone forever.\\n\\nDale called them to dinner about four o'clock, as the sun was reddening\\nthe western rampart of the park. Helen wondered where the day had gone.\\nThe hours had flown swiftly, serenely, bringing her scarcely a thought\\nof her uncle or dread of her forced detention there or possible\\ndiscovery by those outlaws supposed to be hunting for her. After\\nshe realized the passing of those hours she had an intangible and\\nindescribable feeling of what Dale had meant about dreaming the hours\\naway. The nature of Paradise Park was inimical to the kind of thought\\nthat had habitually been hers. She found the new thought absorbing, yet\\nwhen she tried to name it she found that, after all, she had only felt.\\nAt the meal hour she was more than usually quiet. She saw that Dale\\nnoticed it and was trying to interest her or distract her attention. He\\nsucceeded, but she did not choose to let him see that. She strolled\\naway alone to her seat under the pine. Bo passed her once, and cried,\\ntantalizingly:\\n\\n“My, Nell, but you're growing romantic!”\\n\\nNever before in Helen's life had the beauty of the evening star seemed\\nso exquisite or the twilight so moving and shadowy or the darkness so\\ncharged with loneliness. It was their environment  the accompaniment of\\nwild wolf mourn, of the murmuring waterfall, of this strange man of the\\nforest and the unfamiliar elements among which he made his home.\\n\\n\\nNext morning, her energy having returned, Helen shared Bo's lesson in\\nbridling and saddling her horse, and in riding. Bo, however, rode so\\nfast and so hard that for Helen to share her company was impossible. And\\nDale, interested and amused, yet anxious, spent most of his time\\nwith Bo. It was thus that Helen rode all over the park alone. She was\\nastonished at its size, when from almost any point it looked so small.\\nThe atmosphere deceived her. How clearly she could see! And she began to\\njudge distance by the size of familiar things. A horse, looked at across\\nthe longest length of the park, seemed very small indeed. Here and\\nthere she rode upon dark, swift, little brooks, exquisitely clear and\\namber colored and almost hidden from sight by the long grass. These all\\nran one way, and united to form a deeper brook that apparently wound\\nunder the cliffs at the west end, and plunged to an outlet in narrow\\nclefts. When Dale and Bo came to her once she made inquiry, and she was\\nsurprised to learn from Dale that this brook disappeared in a hole in\\nthe rocks and had an outlet on the other side of the mountain. Sometime\\nhe would take them to the lake it formed.\\n\\n“Over the mountain?” asked Helen, again remembering that she must regard\\nherself as a fugitive. “Will it be safe to leave our hiding place? I\\nforget so often why we are here.”\\n\\n“We would be better hidden over there than here,” replied Dale. “The\\nvalley on that side is accessible only from that ridge. An' don't worry\\nabout bein' found. I told you Roy Beeman is watchin' Anson an' his gang.\\nRoy will keep between them an' us.”\\n\\nHelen was reassured, yet there must always linger in the background of\\nher mind a sense of dread. In spite of this, she determined to make the\\nmost of her opportunity. Bo was a stimulus. And so Helen spent the rest\\nof that day riding and tagging after her sister.\\n\\nThe next day was less hard on Helen. Activity, rest, eating, and\\nsleeping took on a wonderful new meaning to her. She had really never\\nknown them as strange joys. She rode, she walked, she climbed a little,\\nshe dozed under her pine tree, she worked helping Dale at camp fire\\ntasks, and when night came she said she did not know herself. That fact\\nhaunted her in vague, deep dreams. Upon awakening she forgot her resolve\\nto study herself. That day passed. And then several more went swiftly\\nbefore she adapted herself to a situation she had reason to believe\\nmight last for weeks and even months.\\n\\n\\nIt was afternoon that Helen loved best of all the time of the day.\\nThe sunrise was fresh, beautiful; the morning was windy, fragrant; the\\nsunset was rosy, glorious; the twilight was sad, changing; and night\\nseemed infinitely sweet with its stars and silence and sleep. But the\\nafternoon, when nothing changed, when all was serene, when time seemed\\nto halt, that was her choice, and her solace.\\n\\nOne afternoon she had camp all to herself. Bo was riding. Dale had\\nclimbed the mountain to see if he could find any trace of tracks or see\\nany smoke from camp fire. Bud was nowhere to be seen, nor any of the\\nother pets. Tom had gone off to some sunny ledge where he could bask in\\nthe sun, after the habit of the wilder brothers of his species. Pedro\\nhad not been seen for a night and a day, a fact that Helen had noted\\nwith concern. However, she had forgotten him, and therefore was the more\\nsurprised to see him coming limping into camp on three legs.\\n\\n“Why, Pedro! You have been fighting. Come here,” she called.\\n\\nThe hound did not look guilty. He limped to her and held up his right\\nfore paw. The action was unmistakable. Helen examined the injured member\\nand presently found a piece of what looked like mussel shell embedded\\ndeeply between the toes. The wound was swollen, bloody, and evidently\\nvery painful. Pedro whined. Helen had to exert all the strength of her\\nfingers to pull it out. Then Pedro howled. But immediately he showed his\\ngratitude by licking her hand. Helen bathed his paw and bound it up.\\n\\nWhen Dale returned she related the incident and, showing the piece of\\nshell, she asked: “Where did that come from? Are there shells in the\\nmountains?”\\n\\n“Once this country was under the sea,” replied Dale. “I've found things\\nthat 'd make you wonder.”\\n\\n“Under the sea!” ejaculated Helen. It was one thing to have read of\\nsuch a strange fact, but a vastly different one to realize it here among\\nthese lofty peaks. Dale was always showing her something or telling her\\nsomething that astounded her.\\n\\n“Look here,” he said one day. “What do you make of that little bunch of\\naspens?”\\n\\nThey were on the farther side of the park and were resting under a\\npine tree. The forest here encroached upon the park with its straggling\\nlines of spruce and groves of aspen. The little clump of aspens did not\\ndiffer from hundreds Helen had seen.\\n\\n“I don't make anything particularly of it,” replied Helen, dubiously.\\n“Just a tiny grove of aspens  some very small, some larger, but none\\nvery big. But it's pretty with its green and yellow leaves fluttering\\nand quivering.”\\n\\n“It doesn't make you think of a fight?”\\n\\n“Fight? No, it certainly does not,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“Well, it's as good an example of fight, of strife, of selfishness, as\\nyou will find in the forest,” he said. “Now come over, you an' Bo, an'\\nlet me show you what I mean.”\\n\\n“Come on, Nell,” cried Bo, with enthusiasm. “He'll open our eyes some\\nmore.”\\n\\nNothing loath, Helen went with them to the little clump of aspens.\\n\\n“About a hundred altogether,” said Dale. “They're pretty well shaded by\\nthe spruces, but they get the sunlight from east an' south. These little\\ntrees all came from the same seedlings. They're all the same age. Four\\nof them stand, say, ten feet or more high an' they're as large around as\\nmy wrist. Here's one that's largest. See how full foliaged he is  how he\\nstands over most of the others, but not so much over these four next to\\nhim. They all stand close together, very close, you see. Most of them\\nare no larger than my thumb. Look how few branches they have, an' none\\nlow down. Look at how few leaves. Do you see how all the branches stand\\nout toward the east an' south  how the leaves, of course, face the same\\nway? See how one branch of one tree bends aside one from another tree.\\nThat's a fight for the sunlight. Here are one  two  three dead trees.\\nLook, I can snap them off. An' now look down under them. Here are little\\ntrees five feet high  four feet high  down to these only a foot\\nhigh. Look how pale, delicate, fragile, unhealthy! They get so little\\nsunshine. They were born with the other trees, but did not get an equal\\nstart. Position gives the advantage, perhaps.”\\n\\nDale led the girls around the little grove, illustrating his words by\\naction. He seemed deeply in earnest.\\n\\n“You understand it's a fight for water an' sun. But mostly sun, because,\\nif the leaves can absorb the sun, the tree an' roots will grow to grasp\\nthe needed moisture. Shade is death  slow death to the life of trees.\\nThese little aspens are fightin' for place in the sunlight. It is a\\nmerciless battle. They push an' bend one another's branches aside an'\\nchoke them. Only perhaps half of these aspens will survive, to make one\\nof the larger clumps, such as that one of full grown trees over there.\\nOne season will give advantage to this saplin' an' next year to that\\none. A few seasons' advantage to one assures its dominance over the\\nothers. But it is never sure of holdin' that dominance. An 'if wind or\\nstorm or a strong growin' rival does not overthrow it, then sooner or\\nlater old age will. For there is absolute and continual fight. What is\\ntrue of these aspens is true of all the trees in the forest an' of all\\nplant life in the forest. What is most wonderful to me is the tenacity\\nof life.”\\n\\nAnd next day Dale showed them an even more striking example of this\\nmystery of nature.\\n\\nHe guided them on horseback up one of the thick, verdant wooded slopes,\\ncalling their attention at various times to the different growths, until\\nthey emerged on the summit of the ridge where the timber grew scant\\nand dwarfed. At the edge of timber line he showed a gnarled and knotted\\nspruce tree, twisted out of all semblance to a beautiful spruce, bent\\nand storm blasted, with almost bare branches, all reaching one' way. The\\ntree was a specter. It stood alone. It had little green upon it. There\\nseemed something tragic about its contortions. But it was alive and\\nstrong. It had no rivals to take sun or moisture. Its enemies were the\\nsnow and wind and cold of the heights.\\n\\nHelen felt, as the realization came to her, the knowledge Dale wished\\nto impart, that it was as sad as wonderful, and as mysterious as it was\\ninspiring. At that moment there were both the sting and sweetness of\\nlife  the pain and the joy  in Helen's heart. These strange facts\\nwere going to teach her  to transform her. And even if they hurt, she\\nwelcomed them.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n“I'll ride you if it breaks  my neck!” panted Bo, passionately, shaking\\nher gloved fist at the gray pony.\\n\\nDale stood near with a broad smile on his face. Helen was within\\nearshot, watching from the edge of the park, and she felt so fascinated\\nand frightened that she could not call out for Bo to stop. The little\\ngray mustang was a beauty, clean limbed and racy, with long black mane\\nand tail, and a fine, spirited head. There was a blanket strapped on his\\nback, but no saddle. Bo held the short halter that had been fastened\\nin a hackamore knot round his nose. She wore no coat; her blouse was\\ncovered with grass and seeds, and it was open at the neck; her hair hung\\nloose and disheveled; one side of her face bore a stain of grass and\\ndirt and a suspicion of blood; the other was red and white; her eyes\\nblazed; beads of sweat stood out on her brow and wet places shone on her\\ncheeks. As she began to strain on the halter, pulling herself closer\\nto the fiery pony, the outline of her slender shape stood out lithe and\\nstrong.\\n\\nBo had been defeated in her cherished and determined ambition to ride\\nDale's mustang, and she was furious. The mustang did not appear to be\\nvicious or mean. But he was spirited, tricky, mischievous, and he had\\nthrown her six times. The scene of Bo's defeat was at the edge of the\\npark, where thick moss and grass afforded soft places for her to fall.\\nIt also afforded poor foothold for the gray mustang, obviously placing\\nhim at a disadvantage. Dale did not bridle him, because he had not been\\nbroken to a bridle; and though it was harder for Bo to try to ride him\\nbareback, there was less risk of her being hurt. Bo had begun in all\\neagerness and enthusiasm, loving and petting the mustang, which she\\nnamed “Pony.” She had evidently anticipated an adventure, but her\\nsmiling, resolute face had denoted confidence. Pony had stood fairly\\nwell to be mounted, and then had pitched and tossed until Bo had slid\\noff or been upset or thrown. After each fall Bo bounced up with less of\\na smile, and more of spirit, until now the Western passion to master a\\nhorse had suddenly leaped to life within her. It was no longer fun, no\\nmore a daring circus trick to scare Helen and rouse Dale's admiration.\\nThe issue now lay between Bo and the mustang.\\n\\nPony reared, snorting, tossing his head, and pawing with front feet.\\n\\n“Pull him down!” yelled Dale.\\n\\nBo did not have much weight, but she had strength, an she hauled with\\nall her might, finally bringing him down.\\n\\n“Now hold hard an' take up rope an' get in to him,” called Dale. “Good!\\nYou're sure not afraid of him. He sees that. Now hold him, talk to him,\\ntell him you're goin' to ride him. Pet him a little. An' when he quits\\nshakin', grab his mane an' jump up an' slide a leg over him. Then hook\\nyour feet under him, hard as you can, an' stick on.”\\n\\nIf Helen had not been so frightened for Bo she would have been able to\\nenjoy her other sensations. Creeping, cold thrills chased over her as\\nBo, supple and quick, slid an arm and a leg over Pony and straightened\\nup on him with a defiant cry. Pony jerked his head down, brought his\\nfeet together in one jump, and began to bounce. Bo got the swing of him\\nthis time and stayed on.\\n\\n“You're ridin' him,” yelled Dale. “Now squeeze hard with your knees.\\nCrack him over the head with your rope... That's the way. Hang on now\\nan' you'll have him beat.”\\n\\nThe mustang pitched all over the space adjacent to Dale and Helen,\\ntearing up the moss and grass. Several times he tossed Bo high, but she\\nslid back to grip him again with her legs, and he could not throw her.\\nSuddenly he raised his head and bolted. Dale answered Bo's triumphant\\ncry. But Pony had not run fifty feet before he tripped and fell,\\nthrowing Bo far over his head. As luck would have it  good luck,\\nDale afterward said  she landed in a boggy place and the force of her\\nmomentum was such that she slid several yards, face down, in wet moss\\nand black ooze.\\n\\nHelen uttered a scream and ran forward. Bo was getting to her knees when\\nDale reached her. He helped her up and half led, half carried her out\\nof the boggy place. Bo was not recognizable. From head to foot she was\\ndripping black ooze.\\n\\n“Oh, Bo! Are you hurt?” cried Helen.\\n\\nEvidently Bo's mouth was full of mud.\\n\\n“Pp  su  tt! Ough! Whew!” she sputtered. “Hurt? No! Can't you see what I\\nlit in? Dale, the sun of a gun didn't throw me. He fell, and I went over\\nhis head.”\\n\\n“Right. You sure rode him. An' he tripped an' slung you a mile,” replied\\nDale. “It's lucky you lit in that bog.”\\n\\n“Lucky! With eyes and nose stopped up? Oooo! I'm full of mud. And my\\nnice  new riding suit!”\\n\\nBo's tones indicated that she was ready to cry. Helen, realizing Bo\\nhad not been hurt, began to laugh. Her sister was the funniest looking\\nobject that had ever come before her eyes.\\n\\n“Nell Rayner  are you  laughing  at me?” demanded Bo, in most righteous\\namaze and anger.\\n\\n“Me laugh ing? N never, Bo,” replied Helen. “Can't you see I'm\\njust  just  ”\\n\\n“See? You idiot! my eyes are full of mud!” flashed Bo. “But I hear you.\\nI'll  I'll get even.”\\n\\nDale was laughing, too, but noiselessly, and Bo, being blind for the\\nmoment, could not be aware of that. By this time they had reached camp.\\nHelen fell flat and laughed as she had never laughed before. When Helen\\nforgot herself so far as to roll on the ground it was indeed a laughing\\nmatter. Dale's big frame shook as he possessed himself of a towel and,\\nwetting it at the spring, began to wipe the mud off Bo's face. But that\\ndid not serve. Bo asked to be led to the water, where she knelt and,\\nwith splashing, washed out her eyes, and then her face, and then the\\nbedraggled strands of hair.\\n\\n“That mustang didn't break my neck, but he rooted my face in the mud.\\nI'll fix him,” she muttered, as she got up. “Please let me have the\\ntowel, now... Well! Milt Dale, you're laughing!”\\n\\n“Ex cuse me, Bo. I  Haw! haw! haw!” Then Dale lurched off, holding his\\nsides.\\n\\nBo gazed after him and then back at Helen.\\n\\n“I suppose if I'd been kicked and smashed and killed you'd laugh,” she\\nsaid. And then she melted. “Oh, my pretty riding suit! What a mess! I\\nmust be a sight... Nell, I rode that wild pony  the sun of a gun! I\\nrode him! That's enough for me. YOU try it. Laugh all you want. It was\\nfunny. But if you want to square yourself with me, help me clean my\\nclothes.”\\n\\n\\nLate in the night Helen heard Dale sternly calling Pedro. She felt some\\nlittle alarm. However, nothing happened, and she soon went to sleep\\nagain. At the morning meal Dale explained.\\n\\n“Pedro an' Tom were uneasy last night. I think there are lions workin'\\nover the ridge somewhere. I heard one scream.”\\n\\n“Scream?” inquired Bo, with interest.\\n\\n“Yes, an' if you ever hear a lion scream you will think it a woman in\\nmortal agony. The cougar cry, as Roy calls it, is the wildest to be\\nheard in the woods. A wolf howls. He is sad, hungry, and wild. But a\\ncougar seems human an' dyin' an' wild. We'll saddle up an' ride over\\nthere. Maybe Pedro will tree a lion. Bo, if he does will you shoot it?”\\n\\n“Sure,” replied Bo, with her mouth full of biscuit.\\n\\nThat was how they came to take a long, slow, steep ride under cover of\\ndense spruce. Helen liked the ride after they got on the heights. But\\nthey did not get to any point where she could indulge in her pleasure\\nof gazing afar over the ranges. Dale led up and down, and finally mostly\\ndown, until they came out within sight of sparser wooded ridges with\\nparks lying below and streams shining in the sun.\\n\\nMore than once Pedro had to be harshly called by Dale. The hound scented\\ngame.\\n\\n“Here's an old kill,” said Dale, halting to point at some bleached bones\\nscattered under a spruce. Tufts of grayish white hair lay strewn around.\\n\\n“What was it?” asked Bo.\\n\\n“Deer, of course. Killed there an' eaten by a lion. Sometime last fall.\\nSee, even the skull is split. But I could not say that the lion did it.”\\n\\nHelen shuddered. She thought of the tame deer down at Dale's camp. How\\nbeautiful and graceful, and responsive to kindness!\\n\\nThey rode out of the woods into a grassy swale with rocks and clumps of\\nsome green bushes bordering it. Here Pedro barked, the first time Helen\\nhad heard him. The hair on his neck bristled, and it required stern\\ncalls from Dale to hold him in. Dale dismounted.\\n\\n“Hyar, Pede, you get back,” he ordered. “I'll let you go presently...\\nGirls, you're goin' to see somethin'. But stay on your horses.”\\n\\nDale, with the hound tense and bristling beside him, strode here\\nand there at the edge of the swale. Presently he halted on a slight\\nelevation and beckoned for the girls to ride over.\\n\\n“Here, see where the grass is pressed down all nice an' round,” he said,\\npointing. “A lion made that. He sneaked there, watchin' for deer. That\\nwas done this mornin'. Come on, now. Let's see if we can trail him.”\\n\\nDale stooped now, studying the grass, and holding Pedro. Suddenly he\\nstraightened up with a flash in his gray eyes.\\n\\n“Here's where he jumped.”\\n\\nBut Helen could not see any reason why Dale should say that. The man of\\nthe forest took a long stride then another.\\n\\n“An' here's where that lion lit on the back of the deer. It was a big\\njump. See the sharp hoof tracks of the deer.” Dale pressed aside tall\\ngrass to show dark, rough, fresh tracks of a deer, evidently made by\\nviolent action.\\n\\n“Come on,” called Dale, walking swiftly. “You're sure goin' to see\\nsomethin' now... Here's where the deer bounded, carryin' the lion.”\\n\\n“What!” exclaimed Bo, incredulously.\\n\\n“The deer was runnin' here with the lion on his back. I'll prove it to\\nyou. Come on, now. Pedro, you stay with me. Girls, it's a fresh trail.”\\n Dale walked along, leading his horse, and occasionally he pointed down\\ninto the grass. “There! See that! That's hair.”\\n\\nHelen did see some tufts of grayish hair scattered on the ground, and\\nshe believed she saw little, dark separations in the grass, where an\\nanimal had recently passed. All at once Dale halted. When Helen reached\\nhim Bo was already there and they were gazing down at a wide, flattened\\nspace in the grass. Even Helen's inexperienced eyes could make out\\nevidences of a struggle. Tufts of gray white hair lay upon the crushed\\ngrass. Helen did not need to see any more, but Dale silently pointed to\\na patch of blood. Then he spoke:\\n\\n“The lion brought the deer down here an' killed him. Probably broke his\\nneck. That deer ran a hundred yards with the lion. See, here's the trail\\nleft where the lion dragged the deer off.”\\n\\nA well defined path showed across the swale.\\n\\n“Girls, you'll see that deer pretty quick,” declared Dale, starting\\nforward. “This work has just been done. Only a few minutes ago.”\\n\\n“How can you tell?” queried Bo.\\n\\n“Look! See that grass. It has been bent down by the deer bein' dragged\\nover it. Now it's springin' up.”\\n\\nDale's next stop was on the other side of the swale, under a spruce with\\nlow, spreading branches. The look of Pedro quickened Helen's pulse.\\nHe was wild to give chase. Fearfully Helen looked where Dale pointed,\\nexpecting to see the lion. But she saw instead a deer lying prostrate\\nwith tongue out and sightless eyes and bloody hair.\\n\\n“Girls, that lion heard us an' left. He's not far,” said Dale, as he\\nstooped to lift the head of the deer. “Warm! Neck broken. See the lion's\\nteeth an' claw marks... It's a doe. Look here. Don't be squeamish,\\ngirls. This is only an hourly incident of everyday life in the forest.\\nSee where the lion has rolled the skin down as neat as I could do it,\\nan' he'd just begun to bite in there when he heard us.”\\n\\n“What murderous work, The sight sickens me!” exclaimed Helen.\\n\\n“It is nature,” said Dale, simply.\\n\\n“Let's kill the lion,” added Bo.\\n\\nFor answer Dale took a quick turn at their saddle girths, and then,\\nmounting, he called to the hound. “Hunt him up, Pedro.”\\n\\nLike a shot the hound was off.\\n\\n“Ride in my tracks an' keep close to me,” called Dale, as he wheeled his\\nhorse.\\n\\n“We're off!” squealed Bo, in wild delight, and she made her mount\\nplunge.\\n\\nHelen urged her horse after them and they broke across a corner of the\\nswale to the woods. Pedro was running straight, with his nose high.\\nHe let out one short bark. He headed into the woods, with Dale not far\\nbehind. Helen was on one of Dale's best horses, but that fact scarcely\\nmanifested itself, because the others began to increase their lead. They\\nentered the woods. It was open, and fairly good going. Bo's horse ran as\\nfast in the woods as he did in the open. That frightened Helen and she\\nyelled to Bo to hold him in. She yelled to deaf ears. That was Bo's\\ngreat risk  she did not intend to be careful. Suddenly the forest rang\\nwith Dale's encouraging yell, meant to aid the girls in following him.\\nHelen's horse caught the spirit of the chase. He gained somewhat on\\nBo, hurdling logs, sometimes two at once. Helen's blood leaped with a\\nstrange excitement, utterly unfamiliar and as utterly resistless. Yet\\nher natural fear, and the intelligence that reckoned with the foolish\\nrisk of this ride, shared alike in her sum of sensations. She tried to\\nremember Dale's caution about dodging branches and snags, and sliding\\nher knees back to avoid knocks from trees. She barely missed some\\nfrightful reaching branches. She received a hard knock, then another,\\nthat unseated her, but frantically she held on and slid back, and at the\\nend of a long run through comparatively open forest she got a stinging\\nblow in the face from a far spreading branch of pine. Bo missed, by what\\nseemed only an inch, a solid snag that would have broken her in two.\\nBoth Pedro and Dale got out of Helen's sight. Then Helen, as she began\\nto lose Bo, felt that she would rather run greater risks than be left\\nbehind to get lost in the forest, and she urged her horse. Dale's yell\\npealed back. Then it seemed even more thrilling to follow by sound than\\nby sight. Wind and brush tore at her. The air was heavily pungent with\\nodor of pine. Helen heard a wild, full bay of the hound, ringing back,\\nfull of savage eagerness, and she believed Pedro had roused out the lion\\nfrom some covert. It lent more stir to her blood and it surely urged her\\nhorse on faster.\\n\\nThen the swift pace slackened. A windfall of timber delayed Helen. She\\ncaught a glimpse of Dale far ahead, climbing a slope. The forest seemed\\nfull of his ringing yell. Helen strangely wished for level ground and\\nthe former swift motion. Next she saw Bo working down to the right, and\\nDale's yell now came from that direction. Helen followed, got out of the\\ntimber, and made better time on a gradual slope down to another park.\\n\\nWhen she reached the open she saw Bo almost across this narrow open\\nground. Here Helen did not need to urge her mount. He snorted and\\nplunged at the level and he got to going so fast that Helen would\\nhave screamed aloud in mingled fear and delight if she had not been\\nbreathless.\\n\\nHer horse had the bad luck to cross soft ground. He went to his knees\\nand Helen sailed out of the saddle over his head. Soft willows and wet\\ngrass broke her fall. She was surprised to find herself unhurt. Up she\\nbounded and certainly did not know this new Helen Rayner. Her horse was\\ncoming, and he had patience with her, but he wanted to hurry. Helen made\\nthe quickest mount of her experience and somehow felt a pride in it.\\nShe would tell Bo that. But just then Bo flashed into the woods out of\\nsight. Helen fairly charged into that green foliage, breaking brush and\\nbranches. She broke through into open forest. Bo was inside, riding down\\nan aisle between pines and spruces. At that juncture Helen heard Dale's\\nmelodious yell near at hand. Coming into still more open forest, with\\nrocks here and there, she saw Dale dismounted under a pine, and Pedro\\nstanding with fore paws upon the tree trunk, and then high up on a\\nbranch a huge tawny colored lion, just like Tom.\\n\\nBo's horse slowed up and showed fear, but he kept on as far as Dale's\\nhorse. But Helen's refused to go any nearer. She had difficulty in\\nhalting him. Presently she dismounted and, throwing her bridle over a\\nstump, she ran on, panting and fearful, yet tingling all over, up to her\\nsister and Dale.\\n\\n“Nell, you did pretty good for a tenderfoot,” was Bo's greeting.\\n\\n“It was a fine chase,” said Dale. “You both rode well. I wish you could\\nhave seen the lion on the ground. He bounded  great long bounds with\\nhis tail up in the air  very funny. An' Pedro almost caught up with him.\\nThat scared me, because he would have killed the hound. Pedro was close\\nto him when he treed. An' there he is  the yellow deer killer. He's a\\nmale an' full grown.”\\n\\nWith that Dale pulled his rifle from its saddle sheath and looked\\nexpectantly at Bo. But she was gazing with great interest and admiration\\nup at the lion.\\n\\n“Isn't he just beautiful?” she burst out. “Oh, look at him spit! Just\\nlike a cat! Dale, he looks afraid he might fall off.”\\n\\n“He sure does. Lions are never sure of their balance in a tree. But I\\nnever saw one make a misstep. He knows he doesn't belong there.”\\n\\nTo Helen the lion looked splendid perched up there. He was long and\\nround and graceful and tawny. His tongue hung out and his plump sides\\nheaved, showing what a quick, hard run he had been driven to. What\\nstruck Helen most forcibly about him was something in his face as he\\nlooked down at the hound. He was scared. He realized his peril. It was\\nnot possible for Helen to watch him killed, yet she could not bring\\nherself to beg Bo not to shoot. Helen confessed she was a tenderfoot.\\n\\n“Get down, Bo, an' let's see how good a shot you are, said Dale. Bo\\nslowly withdrew her fascinated gaze from the lion and looked with a\\nrueful smile at Dale.\\n\\n“I've changed my mind. I said I would kill him, but now I can't. He\\nlooks so  so different from what I'd imagined.”\\n\\nDale's answer was a rare smile of understanding and approval that warmed\\nHelen's heart toward him. All the same, he was amused. Sheathing the\\ngun, he mounted his horse.\\n\\n“Come on, Pedro,” he called. “Come, I tell you,” he added, sharply,\\n“Well, girls, we treed him, anyhow, an' it was fun. Now we'll ride back\\nto the deer he killed an' pack a haunch to camp for our own use.”\\n\\n“Will the lion go back to his  his kill, I think you called it?” asked\\nBo.\\n\\n“I've chased one away from his kill half a dozen times. Lions are not\\nplentiful here an' they don't get overfed. I reckon the balance is\\npretty even.”\\n\\nThis last remark made Helen inquisitive. And as they slowly rode on the\\nback trail Dale talked.\\n\\n“You girls, bein' tender hearted an' not knowin' the life of the forest,\\nwhat's good an' what's bad, think it was a pity the poor deer was\\nkilled by a murderous lion. But you're wrong. As I told you, the lion is\\nabsolutely necessary to the health an' joy of wild life  or deer's wild\\nlife, so to speak. When deer were created or came into existence,\\nthen the lion must have come, too. They can't live without each other.\\nWolves, now, are not particularly deer killers. They live off elk an'\\nanythin' they can catch. So will lions, for that matter. But I mean\\nlions follow the deer to an' fro from winter to summer feedin' grounds.\\nWhere there's no deer you will find no lions. Well, now, if left alone\\ndeer would multiply very fast. In a few years there would be hundreds\\nwhere now there's only one. An' in time, as the generations passed,\\nthey'd lose the fear, the alertness, the speed an' strength, the\\neternal vigilance that is love of life  they'd lose that an' begin\\nto deteriorate, an' disease would carry them off. I saw one season of\\nblack tongue among deer. It killed them off, an' I believe that is one\\nof the diseases of over production. The lions, now, are forever on the\\ntrail of the deer. They have learned. Wariness is an instinct born in\\nthe fawn. It makes him keen, quick, active, fearful, an' so he grows up\\nstrong an' healthy to become the smooth, sleek, beautiful, soft eyed,\\nan' wild lookin' deer you girls love to watch. But if it wasn't for\\nthe lions, the deer would not thrive. Only the strongest an' swiftest\\nsurvive. That is the meanin' of nature. There is always a perfect\\nbalance kept by nature. It may vary in different years, but on the\\nwhole, in the long years, it averages an even balance.”\\n\\n“How wonderfully you put it!” exclaimed Bo, with all her impulsiveness.\\n“Oh, I'm glad I didn't kill the lion.”\\n\\n“What you say somehow hurts me,” said Helen, wistfully, to the hunter.\\n“I see  I feel how true  how inevitable it is. But it changes my  my\\nfeelings. Almost I'd rather not acquire such knowledge as yours. This\\nbalance of nature  how tragic  how sad!”\\n\\n“But why?” asked Dale. “You love birds, an' birds are the greatest\\nkillers in the forest.”\\n\\n“Don't tell me that  don't prove it,” implored Helen. “It is not so much\\nthe love of life in a deer or any creature, and the terrible clinging to\\nlife, that gives me distress. It is suffering. I can't bear to see pain.\\nI can STAND pain myself, but I can't BEAR to see or think of it.”\\n\\n“Well,” replied. Dale, thoughtfully, “There you stump me again. I've\\nlived long in the forest an' when a man's alone he does a heap of\\nthinkin'. An' always I couldn't understand a reason or a meanin'\\nfor pain. Of all the bafflin' things of life, that is the hardest to\\nunderstand an' to forgive  pain!”\\n\\n\\nThat evening, as they sat in restful places round the camp fire, with\\nthe still twilight fading into night, Dale seriously asked the girls\\nwhat the day's chase had meant to them. His manner of asking was\\nproductive of thought. Both girls were silent for a moment.\\n\\n“Glorious!” was Bo's brief and eloquent reply.\\n\\n“Why?” asked. Dale, curiously. “You are a girl. You've been used to\\nhome, people, love, comfort, safety, quiet.”\\n\\n“Maybe that is just why it was glorious,” said Bo, earnestly. “I can\\nhardly explain. I loved the motion of the horse, the feel of wind in\\nmy face, the smell of the pine, the sight of slope and forest glade and\\nwindfall and rocks, and the black shade under the spruces. My blood\\nbeat and burned. My teeth clicked. My nerves all quivered. My heart\\nsometimes, at dangerous moments, almost choked me, and all the time it\\npounded hard. Now my skin was hot and then it was cold. But I think the\\nbest of that chase for me was that I was on a fast horse, guiding him,\\ncontrolling him. He was alive. Oh, how I felt his running!”\\n\\n“Well, what you say is as natural to me as if I felt it,” said Dale. “I\\nwondered. You're certainly full of fire, An', Helen, what do you say?”\\n\\n“Bo has answered you with her feelings,” replied Helen, “I could not do\\nthat and be honest. The fact that Bo wouldn't shoot the lion after we\\ntreed him acquits her. Nevertheless, her answer is purely physical. You\\nknow, Mr. Dale, how you talk about the physical. I should say my sister\\nwas just a young, wild, highly sensitive, hot blooded female of the\\nspecies. She exulted in that chase as an Indian. Her sensations were\\ninherited ones  certainly not acquired by education. Bo always hated\\nstudy. The ride was a revelation to me. I had a good many of Bo's\\nfeelings  though not so strong. But over against them was the opposition\\nof reason, of consciousness. A new born side of my nature confronted me,\\nstrange, surprising, violent, irresistible. It was as if another side of\\nmy personality suddenly said: 'Here I am. Reckon with me now!' And there\\nwas no use for the moment to oppose that strange side. I  the thinking\\nHelen Rayner, was powerless. Oh yes, I had such thoughts even when the\\nbranches were stinging my face and I was thrilling to the bay of the\\nhound. Once my horse fell and threw me... You needn't look alarmed.\\nIt was fine. I went into a soft place and was unhurt. But when I was\\nsailing through the air a thought flashed: this is the end of me! It was\\nlike a dream when you are falling dreadfully. Much of what I felt and\\nthought on that chase must have been because of what I have studied and\\nread and taught. The reality of it, the action and flash, were splendid.\\nBut fear of danger, pity for the chased lion, consciousness of foolish\\nrisk, of a reckless disregard for the serious responsibility I have\\ntaken  all these worked in my mind and held back what might have been a\\nsheer physical, primitive joy of the wild moment.”\\n\\nDale listened intently, and after Helen had finished he studied the fire\\nand thoughtfully poked the red embers with his stick. His face was still\\nand serene, untroubled and unlined, but to Helen his eyes seemed sad,\\npensive, expressive of an unsatisfied yearning and wonder. She had\\ncarefully and earnestly spoken, because she was very curious to hear\\nwhat he might say.\\n\\n“I understand you,” he replied, presently. “An' I'm sure surprised that\\nI can. I've read my books  an' reread them, but no one ever talked like\\nthat to me. What I make of it is this. You've the same blood in you\\nthat's in Bo. An' blood is stronger than brain. Remember that blood is\\nlife. It would be good for you to have it run an' beat an' burn, as\\nBo's did. Your blood did that a thousand years or ten thousand before\\nintellect was born in your ancestors. Instinct may not be greater than\\nreason, but it's a million years older. Don't fight your instincts so\\nhard. If they were not good the God of Creation would not have given\\nthem to you. To day your mind was full of self restraint that did not\\naltogether restrain. You couldn't forget yourself. You couldn't FEEL\\nonly, as Bo did. You couldn't be true to your real nature.”\\n\\n“I don't agree with you,” replied Helen, quickly. “I don't have to be an\\nIndian to be true to myself.”\\n\\n“Why, yes you do,” said Dale.\\n\\n“But I couldn't be an Indian,” declared Helen, spiritedly. “I couldn't\\nFEEL only, as you say Bo did. I couldn't go back in the scale, as you\\nhint. What would all my education amount to  though goodness knows it's\\nlittle enough  if I had no control over primitive feelings that happened\\nto be born in me?”\\n\\n“You'll have little or no control over them when the right time comes,”\\n replied Dale. “Your sheltered life an' education have led you away from\\nnatural instincts. But they're in you an' you'll learn the proof of that\\nout here.”\\n\\n“No. Not if I lived a hundred years in the West,” asserted Helen.\\n\\n“But, child, do you know what you're talkin' about?”\\n\\nHere Bo let out a blissful peal of laughter.\\n\\n“Mr. Dale!” exclaimed Helen, almost affronted. She was stirred. “I know\\nMYSELF, at least.”\\n\\n“But you do not. You've no idea of yourself. You've education, yes, but\\nnot in nature an' life. An' after all, they are the real things. Answer\\nme, now  honestly, will you?”\\n\\n“Certainly, if I can. Some of your questions are hard to answer.”\\n\\n“Have you ever been starved?” he asked.\\n\\n“No,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“Have you ever been lost away from home?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Have you ever faced death  real stark an' naked death, close an'\\nterrible?”\\n\\n“No, indeed.”\\n\\n“Have you ever wanted to kill any one with your bare hands?”\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Dale, you  you amaze me. No!... No!”\\n\\n“I reckon I know your answer to my last question, but I'll ask it,\\nanyhow... Have you ever been so madly in love with a man that you could\\nnot live without him?”\\n\\nBo fell off her seat with a high, trilling laugh. “Oh, you two are\\ngreat!”\\n\\n“Thank Heaven, I haven't been,” replied Helen, shortly.\\n\\n“Then you don't know anythin' about life,” declared Dale, with finality.\\n\\nHelen was not to be put down by that, dubious and troubled as it made\\nher.\\n\\n“Have you experienced all those things?” she queried, stubbornly.\\n\\n“All but the last one. Love never came my way. How could it? I live\\nalone. I seldom go to the villages where there are girls. No girl would\\never care for me. I have nothin'... But, all the same, I understand\\nlove a little, just by comparison with strong feelin's I've lived.”\\n\\nHelen watched the hunter and marveled at his simplicity. His sad and\\npenetrating gaze was on the fire, as if in its white heart to read the\\nsecret denied him. He had said that no girl would ever love him. She\\nimagined he might know considerably less about the nature of girls than\\nof the forest.\\n\\n“To come back to myself,” said Helen, wanting to continue the argument.\\n“You declared I didn't know myself. That I would have no self control. I\\nwill!”\\n\\n“I meant the big things of life,” he said, patiently.\\n\\n“What things?”\\n\\n“I told you. By askin' what had never happened to you I learned what\\nwill happen.”\\n\\n“Those experiences to come to ME!” breathed Helen, incredulously.\\n“Never!”\\n\\n“Sister Nell, they sure will  particularly the last named one  the mad\\nlove,” chimed in Bo, mischievously, yet believingly.\\n\\nNeither Dale nor Helen appeared to hear her interruption.\\n\\n“Let me put it simpler,” began Dale, evidently racking his brain for\\nanalogy. His perplexity appeared painful to him, because he had a great\\nfaith, a great conviction that he could not make clear. “Here I am,\\nthe natural physical man, livin' in the wilds. An' here you come, the\\ncomplex, intellectual woman. Remember, for my argument's sake, that\\nyou're here. An' suppose circumstances forced you to stay here. You'd\\nfight the elements with me an' work with me to sustain life. There\\nmust be a great change in either you or me, accordin' to the other's\\ninfluence. An' can't you see that change must come in you, not because\\nof anythin' superior in me  I'm really inferior to you  but because of\\nour environment? You'd lose your complexity. An' in years to come you'd\\nbe a natural physical woman, because you'd live through an' by the\\nphysical.”\\n\\n“Oh dear, will not education be of help to the Western woman?” queried\\nHelen, almost in despair.\\n\\n“Sure it will,” answered Dale, promptly. “What the West needs is women\\nwho can raise an' teach children. But you don't understand me. You don't\\nget under your skin. I reckon I can't make you see my argument as I feel\\nit. You take my word for this, though. Sooner or later you WILL wake up\\nan' forget yourself. Remember.”\\n\\n“Nell, I'll bet you do, too,” said Bo, seriously for her. “It may seem\\nstrange to you, but I understand Dale. I feel what he means. It's a sort\\nof shock. Nell, we're not what we seem. We're not what we fondly imagine\\nwe are. We've lived too long with people  too far away from the earth.\\nYou know the Bible says something like this: 'Dust thou art and to dust\\nthou shalt return.' Where DO we come from?”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nDays passed.\\n\\nEvery morning Helen awoke with a wondering question as to what this\\nday would bring forth, especially with regard to possible news from her\\nuncle. It must come sometime and she was anxious for it. Something about\\nthis simple, wild camp life had begun to grip her. She found herself\\nshirking daily attention to the clothes she had brought West. They\\nneeded it, but she had begun to see how superficial they really were.\\nOn the other hand, camp fire tasks had come to be a pleasure. She had\\nlearned a great deal more about them than had Bo. Worry and dread\\nwere always impinging upon the fringe of her thoughts  always vaguely\\npresent, though seldom annoying. They were like shadows in dreams. She\\nwanted to get to her uncle's ranch, to take up the duties of her new\\nlife. But she was not prepared to believe she would not regret this wild\\nexperience. She must get away from that in order to see it clearly, and\\nshe began to have doubts of herself.\\n\\nMeanwhile the active and restful outdoor life went on. Bo leaned more\\nand more toward utter reconciliation to it. Her eyes had a wonderful\\nflash, like blue lightning; her cheeks were gold and brown; her hands\\ntanned dark as an Indian's.\\n\\nShe could vault upon the gray mustang, or, for that matter, clear over\\nhis back. She learned to shoot a rifle accurately enough to win Dale's\\npraise, and vowed she would like to draw a bead upon a grizzly bear or\\nupon Snake Anson.\\n\\n“Bo, if you met that grizzly Dale said has been prowling round camp\\nlately you'd run right up a tree,” declared Helen, one morning, when Bo\\nseemed particularly boastful.\\n\\n“Don't fool yourself,” retorted Bo.\\n\\n“But I've seen you run from a mouse!”\\n\\n“Sister, couldn't I be afraid of a mouse and not a bear?”\\n\\n“I don't see how.”\\n\\n“Well, bears, lions, outlaws, and other wild beasts are to be met with\\nhere in the West, and my mind's made up,” said Bo, in slow nodding\\ndeliberation.\\n\\nThey argued as they had always argued, Helen for reason and common sense\\nand restraint, Bo on the principle that if she must fight it was better\\nto get in the first blow.\\n\\nThe morning on which this argument took place Dale was a long time in\\ncatching the horses. When he did come in he shook his head seriously.\\n\\n“Some varmint's been chasin' the horses,” he said, as he reached for his\\nsaddle. “Did you hear them snortin' an' runnin' last night?”\\n\\nNeither of the girls had been awakened.\\n\\n“I missed one of the colts,” went on Dale, “an' I'm goin' to ride across\\nthe park.”\\n\\nDale's movements were quick and stern. It was significant that he chose\\nhis heavier rifle, and, mounting, with a sharp call to Pedro, he rode\\noff without another word to the girls.\\n\\nBo watched him for a moment and then began to saddle the mustang.\\n\\n“You won't follow him?” asked Helen, quickly.\\n\\n“I sure will,” replied Bo. “He didn't forbid it.”\\n\\n“But he certainly did not want us.”\\n\\n“He might not want you, but I'll bet he wouldn't object to me,\\nwhatever's up,” said Bo, shortly.\\n\\n“Oh! So you think  ” exclaimed Helen, keenly hurt. She bit her tongue to\\nkeep back a hot reply. And it was certain that a bursting gush of anger\\nflooded over her. Was she, then, such a coward? Did Dale think this\\nslip of a sister, so wild and wilful, was a stronger woman than she? A\\nmoment's silent strife convinced her that no doubt he thought so and\\nno doubt he was right. Then the anger centered upon herself, and Helen\\nneither understood nor trusted herself.\\n\\nThe outcome proved an uncontrollable impulse. Helen began to saddle her\\nhorse. She had the task half accomplished when Bo's call made her look\\nup.\\n\\n“Listen!”\\n\\nHelen heard a ringing, wild bay of the hound.\\n\\n“That's Pedro,” she said, with a thrill.\\n\\n“Sure. He's running. We never heard him bay like that before.”\\n\\n“Where's Dale?”\\n\\n“He rode out of sight across there,” replied Bo, pointing. “And Pedro's\\nrunning toward us along that slope. He must be a mile  two miles from\\nDale.”\\n\\n“But Dale will follow.”\\n\\n“Sure. But he'd need wings to get near that hound now. Pedro couldn't\\nhave gone across there with him... just listen.”\\n\\nThe wild note of the hound manifestly stirred Bo to irrepressible\\naction. Snatching up Dale's lighter rifle, she shoved it into her\\nsaddle sheath, and, leaping on the mustang, she ran him over brush and\\nbrook, straight down the park toward the place Pedro was climbing. For\\nan instant Helen stood amazed beyond speech. When Bo sailed over a big\\nlog, like a steeple chaser, then Helen answered to further unconsidered\\nimpulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened. Without coat or hat\\nshe mounted. The nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the\\nsaddle. A strange, trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins.\\nShe wanted to scream for Bo to wait. Bo was out of sight, but the deep,\\nmuddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded\\nHelen an easy trail to follow. In fact, her horse needed no guiding. He\\nran in and out of the straggling spruces along the edge of the park, and\\nsuddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang\\nstanding still. Bo was looking up and listening.\\n\\n“There he is!” cried Bo, as the hound bayed ringingly, closer to them\\nthis time, and she spurred away.\\n\\nHelen's horse followed without urging. He was excited. His ears were up.\\nSomething was in the wind. Helen had never ridden along this broken end\\nof the park, and Bo was not easy to keep up with. She led across bogs,\\nbrooks, swales, rocky little ridges, through stretches of timber and\\ngroves of aspen so thick Helen could scarcely squeeze through. Then\\nBo came out into a large open offshoot of the park, right under the\\nmountain slope, and here she sat, her horse watching and listening.\\nHelen rode up to her, imagining once that she had heard the hound.\\n\\n“Look! Look!” Bo's scream made her mustang stand almost straight up.\\n\\nHelen gazed up to see a big brown bear with a frosted coat go lumbering\\nacross an opening on the slope.\\n\\n“It's a grizzly! He'll kill Pedro! Oh, where is Dale!” cried Bo, with\\nintense excitement.\\n\\n“Bo! That bear is running down! We  we must get  out of his road,”\\n panted Helen, in breathless alarm.\\n\\n“Dale hasn't had time to be close... Oh, I wish he'd come! I don't know\\nwhat to do.”\\n\\n“Ride back. At least wait for him.”\\n\\nJust then Pedro spoke differently, in savage barks, and following that\\ncame a loud growl and crashings in the brush. These sounds appeared to\\nbe not far up the slope.\\n\\n“Nell! Do you hear? Pedro's fighting the bear,” burst out Bo. Her face\\npaled, her eyes flashed like blue steel. “The bear 'll kill him!”\\n\\n“Oh, that would be dreadful!” replied Helen, in distress. “But what on\\nearth can we do?”\\n\\n“HEL LO, DALE!” called Bo, at the highest pitch of her piercing voice.\\n\\nNo answer came. A heavy crash of brush, a rolling of stones, another\\ngrowl from the slope told Helen that the hound had brought the bear to\\nbay.\\n\\n“Nell, I'm going up,” said Bo, deliberately.\\n\\n“No no! Are you mad?” returned Helen.\\n\\n“The bear will kill Pedro.”\\n\\n“He might kill you.”\\n\\n“You ride that way and yell for Dale,” rejoined Bo.\\n\\n“What will  you do?” gasped Helen.\\n\\n“I'll shoot at the bear  scare him off. If he chases me he can't catch\\nme coming downhill. Dale said that.”\\n\\n“You're crazy!” cried Helen, as Bo looked up the slope, searching for\\nopen ground. Then she pulled the rifle from its sheath.\\n\\nBut Bo did not hear or did not care. She spurred the mustang, and he,\\nwild to run, flung grass and dirt from his heels. What Helen would have\\ndone then she never knew, but the fact was that her horse bolted after\\nthe mustang. In an instant, seemingly, Bo had disappeared in the gold\\nand green of the forest slope. Helen's mount climbed on a run, snorting\\nand heaving, through aspens, brush, and timber, to come out into a\\nnarrow, long opening extending lengthwise up the slope.\\n\\nA sudden prolonged crash ahead alarmed Helen and halted her horse. She\\nsaw a shaking of aspens. Then a huge brown beast leaped as a cat out of\\nthe woods. It was a bear of enormous size. Helen's heart stopped  her\\ntongue clove to the roof of her mouth. The bear turned. His mouth was\\nopen, red and dripping. He looked shaggy, gray. He let out a terrible\\nbawl. Helen's every muscle froze stiff. Her horse plunged high and\\nsidewise, wheeling almost in the air, neighing his terror. Like a stone\\nshe dropped from the saddle. She did not see the horse break into the\\nwoods, but she heard him. Her gaze never left the bear even while she\\nwas falling, and it seemed she alighted in an upright position with her\\nback against a bush. It upheld her. The bear wagged his huge head from\\nside to side. Then, as the hound barked close at hand, he turned to run\\nheavily uphill and out of the opening.\\n\\nThe instant of his disappearance was one of collapse for Helen. Frozen\\nwith horror, she had been unable to move or feel or think. All at once\\nshe was a quivering mass of cold, helpless flesh, wet with perspiration,\\nsick with a shuddering, retching, internal convulsion, her mind\\nliberated from paralyzing shock. The moment was as horrible as that\\nin which the bear had bawled his frightful rage. A stark, icy, black\\nemotion seemed in possession of her. She could not lift a hand, yet all\\nof her body appeared shaking. There was a fluttering, a strangling in\\nher throat. The crushing weight that surrounded her heart eased before\\nshe recovered use of her limbs. Then, the naked and terrible thing was\\ngone, like a nightmare giving way to consciousness. What blessed relief!\\nHelen wildly gazed about her. The bear and hound were out of sight, and\\nso was her horse. She stood up very dizzy and weak. Thought of Bo then\\nseemed to revive her, to shock different life and feeling throughout all\\nher cold extremities. She listened.\\n\\nShe heard a thudding of hoofs down the slope, then Dale's clear, strong\\ncall. She answered. It appeared long before he burst out of the woods,\\nriding hard and leading her horse. In that time she recovered fully,\\nand when he reached her, to put a sudden halt upon the fiery Ranger, she\\ncaught the bridle he threw and swiftly mounted her horse. The feel of\\nthe saddle seemed different. Dale's piercing gray glance thrilled her\\nstrangely.\\n\\n“You're white. Are you hurt?” he said.\\n\\n“No. I was scared.”\\n\\n“But he threw you?”\\n\\n“Yes, he certainly threw me.”\\n\\n“What happened?”\\n\\n“We heard the hound and we rode along the timber. Then we saw the\\nbear  a monster  white  coated  ”\\n\\n“I know. It's a grizzly. He killed the colt  your pet. Hurry now. What\\nabout Bo?”\\n\\n“Pedro was fighting the bear. Bo said he'd be killed. She rode right up\\nhere. My horse followed. I couldn't have stopped him. But we lost Bo.\\nRight there the bear came out. He roared. My horse threw me and ran off.\\nPedro's barking saved me  my life, I think. Oh! that was awful! Then the\\nbear went up  there... And you came.”\\n\\n“Bo's followin' the hound!” ejaculated Dale. And, lifting his hands to\\nhis mouth, he sent out a stentorian yell that rolled up the slope, rang\\nagainst the cliffs, pealed and broke and died away. Then he waited,\\nlistening. From far up the slope came a faint, wild cry, high pitched\\nand sweet, to create strange echoes, floating away to die in the\\nravines.\\n\\n“She's after him!” declared Dale, grimly.\\n\\n“Bo's got your rifle,” said Helen. “Oh, we must hurry.”\\n\\n“You go back,” ordered Dale, wheeling his horse.\\n\\n“No!” Helen felt that word leave her lips with the force of a bullet.\\n\\nDale spurred Ranger and took to the open slope. Helen kept at his heels\\nuntil timber was reached. Here a steep trail led up. Dale dismounted.\\n\\n“Horse tracks  bear tracks  dog tracks,” he said, bending over. “We'll\\nhave to walk up here. It'll save our horses an' maybe time, too.”\\n\\n“Is Bo riding up there?” asked Helen, eying the steep ascent.\\n\\n“She sure is.” With that Dale started up, leading his horse. Helen\\nfollowed. It was rough and hard work. She was lightly clad, yet soon she\\nwas hot, laboring, and her heart began to hurt. When Dale halted to\\nrest Helen was just ready to drop. The baying of the hound, though\\ninfrequent, inspirited her. But presently that sound was lost. Dale said\\nbear and hound had gone over the ridge and as soon as the top was gained\\nhe would hear them again.\\n\\n“Look there,” he said, presently, pointing to fresh tracks, larger than\\nthose made by Bo's mustang. “Elk tracks. We've scared a big bull an'\\nhe's right ahead of us. Look sharp an' you'll see him.”\\n\\nHelen never climbed so hard and fast before, and when they reached the\\nridge top she was all tuckered out. It was all she could do to get on\\nher horse. Dale led along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the\\nwestern end, which was considerably higher. In places open rocky ground\\nsplit the green timber. Dale pointed toward a promontory.\\n\\nHelen saw a splendid elk silhouetted against the sky. He was a light\\ngray over all his hindquarters, with shoulders and head black. His\\nponderous, wide spread antlers towered over him, adding to the wildness\\nof his magnificent poise as he stood there, looking down into the\\nvalley, no doubt listening for the bay of the hound. When he heard\\nDale's horse he gave one bound, gracefully and wonderfully carrying his\\nantlers, to disappear in the green.\\n\\nAgain on a bare patch of ground Dale pointed down. Helen saw big round\\ntracks, toeing in a little, that gave her a chill. She knew these were\\ngrizzly tracks.\\n\\nHard riding was not possible on this ridge crest, a fact that gave Helen\\ntime to catch her breath. At length, coming out upon the very summit\\nof the mountain, Dale heard the hound. Helen's eyes feasted afar upon\\na wild scene of rugged grandeur, before she looked down on this western\\nslope at her feet to see bare, gradual descent, leading down to sparsely\\nwooded bench and on to deep green canuon.\\n\\n“Ride hard now!” yelled Dale. “I see Bo, an' I'll have to ride to catch\\nher.”\\n\\nDale spurred down the slope. Helen rode in his tracks and, though she\\nplunged so fast that she felt her hair stand up with fright, she saw him\\ndraw away from her. Sometimes her horse slid on his haunches for a\\nfew yards, and at these hazardous moments she got her feet out of the\\nstirrups so as to fall free from him if he went down. She let him choose\\nthe way, while she gazed ahead at Dale, and then farther on, in the hope\\nof seeing Bo. At last she was rewarded. Far Down the wooded bench she\\nsaw a gray flash of the little mustang and a bright glint of Bo's hair.\\nHer heart swelled. Dale would soon overhaul Bo and come between her and\\nperil. And on the instant, though Helen was unconscious of it then,\\na remarkable change came over her spirit. Fear left her. And a hot,\\nexalting, incomprehensible something took possession of her.\\n\\nShe let the horse run, and when he had plunged to the foot of that slope\\nof soft ground he broke out across the open bench at a pace that made\\nthe wind bite Helen's cheeks and roar in her ears. She lost sight of\\nDale. It gave her a strange, grim exultance. She bent her eager gaze to\\nfind the tracks of his horse, and she found them. Also she made out the\\ntracks of Bo's mustang and the bear and the hound. Her horse, scenting\\ngame, perhaps, and afraid to be left alone, settled into a fleet and\\npowerful stride, sailing over logs and brush. That open bench had looked\\nshort, but it was long, and Helen rode down the gradual descent at\\nbreakneck speed. She would not be left behind. She had awakened to a\\nheedlessness of risk. Something burned steadily within her. A grim, hard\\nanger of joy! When she saw, far down another open, gradual descent, that\\nDale had passed Bo and that Bo was riding the little mustang as never\\nbefore, then Helen flamed with a madness to catch her, to beat her in\\nthat wonderful chase, to show her and Dale what there really was in the\\ndepths of Helen Rayner.\\n\\nHer ambition was to be short lived, she divined from the lay of the land\\nahead, but the ride she lived then for a flying mile was something that\\nwould always blanch her cheeks and prick her skin in remembrance.\\n\\nThe open ground was only too short. That thundering pace soon brought\\nHelen's horse to the timber. Here it took all her strength to check his\\nheadlong flight over deadfalls and between small jack pines. Helen lost\\nsight of Bo, and she realized it would take all her wits to keep from\\ngetting lost. She had to follow the trail, and in some places it was\\nhard to see from horseback.\\n\\nBesides, her horse was mettlesome, thoroughly aroused, and he wanted a\\nfree rein and his own way. Helen tried that, only to lose the trail and\\nto get sundry knocks from trees and branches. She could not hear the\\nhound, nor Dale. The pines were small, close together, and tough. They\\nwere hard to bend. Helen hurt her hands, scratched her face, barked her\\nknees. The horse formed a habit suddenly of deciding to go the way he\\nliked instead of the way Helen guided him, and when he plunged between\\nsaplings too close to permit easy passage it was exceedingly hard on\\nher. That did not make any difference to Helen. Once worked into a\\nfrenzy, her blood stayed at high pressure. She did not argue with\\nherself about a need of desperate hurry. Even a blow on the head that\\nnearly blinded her did not in the least retard her. The horse could\\nhardly be held, and not at all in the few open places.\\n\\nAt last Helen reached another slope. Coming out upon canuon rim, she\\nheard Dale's clear call, far down, and Bo's answering peal, high and\\npiercing, with its note of exultant wildness. Helen also heard the bear\\nand the hound fighting at the bottom of this canuon.\\n\\nHere Helen again missed the tracks made by Dale and Bo. The descent\\nlooked impassable. She rode back along the rim, then forward. Finally\\nshe found where the ground had been plowed deep by hoofs, down over\\nlittle banks. Helen's horse balked at these jumps. When she goaded him\\nover them she went forward on his neck. It seemed like riding straight\\ndownhill. The mad spirit of that chase grew more stingingly keen to\\nHelen as the obstacles grew. Then, once more the bay of the hound and\\nthe bawl of the bear made a demon of her horse. He snorted a shrill\\ndefiance. He plunged with fore hoofs in the air. He slid and broke a way\\ndown the steep, soft banks, through the thick brush and thick clusters\\nof saplings, sending loose rocks and earth into avalanches ahead of him.\\nHe fell over one bank, but a thicket of aspens upheld him so that he\\nrebounded and gained his feet. The sounds of fight ceased, but Dale's\\nthrilling call floated up on the pine scented air.\\n\\nBefore Helen realized it she was at the foot of the slope, in a narrow\\ncanuon bed, full of rocks and trees, with a soft roar of running water\\nfilling her ears. Tracks were everywhere, and when she came to the first\\nopen place she saw where the grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into\\nthe water. Here he had fought Pedro. Signs of that battle were easy to\\nread. Helen saw where his huge tracks, still wet, led up the opposite\\nsandy bank.\\n\\nThen down stream Helen did some more reckless and splendid riding. On\\nlevel ground the horse was great. Once he leaped clear across the brook.\\nEvery plunge, every turn Helen expected to come upon Dale and Bo facing\\nthe bear. The canuon narrowed, the stream bed deepened. She had to slow\\ndown to get through the trees and rocks. Quite unexpectedly she rode\\npell mell upon Dale and Bo and the panting Pedro. Her horse plunged to a\\nhalt, answering the shrill neighs of the other horses.\\n\\nDale gazed in admiring amazement at Helen.\\n\\n“Say, did you meet the bear again?” he queried, blankly.\\n\\n“No. Didn't  you  kill him?” panted Helen, slowly sagging in her saddle.\\n\\n“He got away in the rocks. Rough country down here.”\\n\\nHelen slid off her horse and fell with a little panting cry of relief.\\nShe saw that she was bloody, dirty, disheveled, and wringing wet with\\nperspiration. Her riding habit was torn into tatters. Every muscle\\nseemed to burn and sting, and all her bones seemed broken. But it was\\nworth all this to meet Dale's penetrating glance, to see Bo's utter,\\nincredulous astonishment.\\n\\n“Nell  Rayner!” gasped Bo.\\n\\n“If  my horse 'd been  any good  in the woods,” panted Helen, “I'd not\\nlost  so much time  riding down this mountain. And I'd caught you  beat\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Girl, did you RIDE down this last slope?” queried Dale.\\n\\n“I sure did,” replied Helen, smiling.\\n\\n“We walked every step of the way, and was lucky to get down at that,”\\n responded Dale, gravely. “No horse should have been ridden down there.\\nWhy, he must have slid down.”\\n\\n“We slid  yes. But I stayed on him.”\\n\\nBo's incredulity changed to wondering, speechless admiration. And Dale's\\nrare smile changed his gravity.\\n\\n“I'm sorry. It was rash of me. I thought you'd go back... But all's\\nwell that ends well... Helen, did you wake up to day?”\\n\\nShe dropped her eyes, not caring to meet the questioning gaze upon her.\\n\\n“Maybe  a little,” she replied, and she covered her face with her hands.\\nRemembrance of his questions  of his assurance that she did not know\\nthe real meaning of life  of her stubborn antagonism  made her somehow\\nashamed. But it was not for long.\\n\\n“The chase was great,” she said. “I did not know myself. You were\\nright.”\\n\\n“In how many ways did you find me right?” he asked.\\n\\n“I think all  but one,” she replied, with a laugh and a shudder. “I'm\\nnear starved NOW  I was so furious at Bo that I could have choked her. I\\nfaced that horrible brute... Oh, I know what it is to fear death!... I\\nwas lost twice on the ride  absolutely lost. That's all.”\\n\\nBo found her tongue. “The last thing was for you to fall wildly in love,\\nwasn't it?”\\n\\n“According to Dale, I must add that to my new experiences of\\nto day  before I can know real life,” replied Helen, demurely.\\n\\nThe hunter turned away. “Let us go,” he said, soberly.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nAfter more days of riding the grassy level of that wonderfully gold\\nand purple park, and dreamily listening by day to the ever low and\\never changing murmur of the waterfall, and by night to the wild, lonely\\nmourn of a hunting wolf, and climbing to the dizzy heights where the\\nwind stung sweetly, Helen Rayner lost track of time and forgot her\\nperil.\\n\\nRoy Beeman did not return. If occasionally Dale mentioned Roy and his\\nquest, the girls had little to say beyond a recurrent anxiety for the\\nold uncle, and then they forgot again. Paradise Park, lived in a little\\nwhile at that season of the year, would have claimed any one, and ever\\nafterward haunted sleeping or waking dreams.\\n\\nBo gave up to the wild life, to the horses and rides, to the many pets,\\nand especially to the cougar, Tom. The big cat followed her everywhere,\\nplayed with her, rolling and pawing, kitten like, and he would lay\\nhis massive head in her lap to purr his content. Bo had little fear of\\nanything, and here in the wilds she soon lost that.\\n\\nAnother of Dale's pets was a half grown black bear named Muss. He was\\nabnormally jealous of little Bud and he had a well developed hatred\\nof Tom, otherwise he was a very good tempered bear, and enjoyed Dale's\\nimpartial regard. Tom, however, chased Muss out of camp whenever Dale's\\nback was turned, and sometimes Muss stayed away, shifting for himself.\\nWith the advent of Bo, who spent a good deal of time on the animals,\\nMuss manifestly found the camp more attractive. Whereupon, Dale\\npredicted trouble between Tom and Muss.\\n\\nBo liked nothing better than a rough and tumble frolic with the black\\nbear. Muss was not very big nor very heavy, and in a wrestling bout with\\nthe strong and wiry girl he sometimes came out second best. It spoke\\nwell of him that he seemed to be careful not to hurt Bo. He never bit\\nor scratched, though he sometimes gave her sounding slaps with his paws.\\nWhereupon, Bo would clench her gauntleted fists and sail into him in\\nearnest.\\n\\nOne afternoon before the early supper they always had, Dale and Helen\\nwere watching Bo teasing the bear. She was in her most vixenish mood,\\nfull of life and fight. Tom lay his long length on the grass, watching\\nwith narrow, gleaming eyes.\\n\\nWhen Bo and Muss locked in an embrace and went down to roll over and\\nover, Dale called Helen's attention to the cougar.\\n\\n“Tom's jealous. It's strange how animals are like people. Pretty soon\\nI'll have to corral Muss, or there'll be a fight.”\\n\\nHelen could not see anything wrong with Tom except that he did not look\\nplayful.\\n\\nDuring supper time both bear and cougar disappeared, though this was not\\nremarked until afterward. Dale whistled and called, but the rival pets\\ndid not return. Next morning Tom was there, curled up snugly at the foot\\nof Bo's bed, and when she arose he followed her around as usual. But\\nMuss did not return.\\n\\nThe circumstance made Dale anxious. He left camp, taking Tom with him,\\nand upon returning stated that he had followed Muss's track as far as\\npossible, and then had tried to put Tom on the trail, but the cougar\\nwould not or could not follow it. Dale said Tom never liked a bear\\ntrail, anyway, cougars and bears being common enemies. So, whether by\\naccident or design, Bo lost one of her playmates.\\n\\nThe hunter searched some of the slopes next day and even went up on one\\nof the mountains. He did not discover any sign of Muss, but he said he\\nhad found something else.\\n\\n“Bo you girls want some more real excitement?” he asked.\\n\\nHelen smiled her acquiescence and Bo replied with one of her forceful\\nspeeches.\\n\\n“Don't mind bein' good an' scared?” he went on.\\n\\n“You can't scare me,” bantered Bo. But Helen looked doubtful.\\n\\n“Up in one of the parks I ran across one of my horses  a lame bay you\\nhaven't seen. Well, he had been killed by that old silvertip. The one we\\nchased. Hadn't been dead over an hour. Blood was still runnin' an' only\\na little meat eaten. That bear heard me or saw me an' made off into the\\nwoods. But he'll come back to night. I'm goin' up there, lay for him,\\nan' kill him this time. Reckon you'd better go, because I don't want to\\nleave you here alone at night.”\\n\\n“Are you going to take Tom?” asked Bo.\\n\\n“No. The bear might get his scent. An', besides, Tom ain't reliable on\\nbears. I'll leave Pedro home, too.”\\n\\nWhen they had hurried supper, and Dale had gotten in the horses, the sun\\nhad set and the valley was shadowing low down, while the ramparts were\\nstill golden. The long zigzag trail Dale followed up the slope took\\nnearly an hour to climb, so that when that was surmounted and he led\\nout of the woods twilight had fallen. A rolling park extended as far as\\nHelen could see, bordered by forest that in places sent out straggling\\nstretches of trees. Here and there, like islands, were isolated patches\\nof timber.\\n\\nAt ten thousand feet elevation the twilight of this clear and cold night\\nwas a rich and rare atmospheric effect. It looked as if it was seen\\nthrough perfectly clear smoked glass. Objects were singularly visible,\\neven at long range, and seemed magnified. In the west, where the\\nafterglow of sunset lingered over the dark, ragged, spruce speared\\nhorizon line, there was such a transparent golden line melting into\\nvivid star fired blue that Helen could only gaze and gaze in wondering\\nadmiration.\\n\\nDale spurred his horse into a lope and the spirited mounts of the girls\\nkept up with him. The ground was rough, with tufts of grass growing\\nclose together, yet the horses did not stumble. Their action and\\nsnorting betrayed excitement. Dale led around several clumps of timber,\\nup a long grassy swale, and then straight westward across an open flat\\ntoward where the dark fringed forest line raised itself wild and clear\\nagainst the cold sky. The horses went swiftly, and the wind cut like a\\nblade of ice. Helen could barely get her breath and she panted as if she\\nhad just climbed a laborsome hill. The stars began to blink out of the\\nblue, and the gold paled somewhat, and yet twilight lingered. It seemed\\nlong across that flat, but really was short. Coming to a thin line of\\ntrees that led down over a slope to a deeper but still isolated patch\\nof woods, Dale dismounted and tied his horse. When the girls got off he\\nhaltered their horses also.\\n\\n“Stick close to me an' put your feet down easy,” he whispered. How tall\\nand dark he loomed in the fading light! Helen thrilled, as she had often\\nof late, at the strange, potential force of the man. Stepping softly,\\nwithout the least sound, Dale entered this straggly bit of woods, which\\nappeared to have narrow byways and nooks. Then presently he came to\\nthe top of a well wooded slope, dark as pitch, apparently. But as Helen\\nfollowed she perceived the trees, and they were thin dwarf spruce,\\npartly dead. The slope was soft and springy, easy to step upon without\\nnoise. Dale went so cautiously that Helen could not hear him, and\\nsometimes in the gloom she could not see him. Then the chill thrills ran\\nover her. Bo kept holding on to Helen, which fact hampered Helen as\\nwell as worked somewhat to disprove Bo's boast. At last level ground was\\nreached. Helen made out a light gray background crossed by black bars.\\nAnother glance showed this to be the dark tree trunks against the open\\npark.\\n\\nDale halted, and with a touch brought Helen to a straining pause. He was\\nlistening. It seemed wonderful to watch him bend his head and stand as\\nsilent and motionless as one of the dark trees.\\n\\n“He's not there yet,” Dale whispered, and he stepped forward very\\nslowly. Helen and Bo began to come up against thin dead branches that\\nwere invisible and then cracked. Then Dale knelt down, seemed to melt\\ninto the ground.\\n\\n“You'll have to crawl,” he whispered.\\n\\nHow strange and thrilling that was for Helen, and hard work! The ground\\nbore twigs and dead branches, which had to be carefully crawled over;\\nand lying flat, as was necessary, it took prodigious effort to drag her\\nbody inch by inch. Like a huge snake, Dale wormed his way along.\\n\\nGradually the wood lightened. They were nearing the edge of the park.\\nHelen now saw a strip of open with a high, black wall of spruce beyond.\\nThe afterglow flashed or changed, like a dimming northern light, and\\nthen failed. Dale crawled on farther to halt at length between two\\ntree trunks at the edge of the wood.\\n\\n“Come up beside me,” he whispered.\\n\\nHelen crawled on, and presently Bo was beside her panting, with pale\\nface and great, staring eyes, plain to be seen in the wan light.\\n\\n“Moon's comin' up. We're just in time. The old grizzly's not there yet,\\nbut I see coyotes. Look.”\\n\\nDale pointed across the open neck of park to a dim blurred patch\\nstanding apart some little distance from the black wall.\\n\\n“That's the dead horse,” whispered Dale. “An' if you watch close you can\\nsee the coyotes. They're gray an' they move... Can't you hear them?”\\n\\nHelen's excited ears, so full of throbs and imaginings, presently\\nregistered low snaps and snarls. Bo gave her arm a squeeze.\\n\\n“I hear them. They're fighting. Oh, gee!” she panted, and drew a long,\\nfull breath of unutterable excitement.\\n\\n“Keep quiet now an' watch an' listen,” said the hunter.\\n\\nSlowly the black, ragged forest line seemed to grow blacker and lift;\\nslowly the gray neck of park lightened under some invisible influence;\\nslowly the stars paled and the sky filled over. Somewhere the moon was\\nrising. And slowly that vague blurred patch grew a little clearer.\\n\\nThrough the tips of the spruce, now seen to be rather close at hand,\\nshone a slender, silver crescent moon, darkening, hiding, shining again,\\nclimbing until its exquisite sickle point topped the trees, and then,\\nmagically, it cleared them, radiant and cold. While the eastern black\\nwall shaded still blacker, the park blanched and the border line\\nopposite began to stand out as trees.\\n\\n“Look! Look!” cried Bo, very low and fearfully, as she pointed.\\n\\n“Not so loud,” whispered Dale.\\n\\n“But I see something!”\\n\\n“Keep quiet,” he admonished.\\n\\nHelen, in the direction Bo pointed, could not see anything but\\nmoon blanched bare ground, rising close at hand to a little ridge.\\n\\n“Lie still,” whispered Dale. “I'm goin' to crawl around to get a look\\nfrom another angle. I'll be right back.”\\n\\nHe moved noiselessly backward and disappeared. With him gone, Helen felt\\na palpitating of her heart and a prickling of her skin.\\n\\n“Oh, my! Nell! Look!” whispered Bo, in fright. “I know I saw something.”\\n\\nOn top of the little ridge a round object moved slowly, getting farther\\nout into the light. Helen watched with suspended breath. It moved out\\nto be silhouetted against the sky  apparently a huge, round, bristling\\nanimal, frosty in color. One instant it seemed huge  the next\\nsmall  then close at hand  and far away. It swerved to come directly\\ntoward them. Suddenly Helen realized that the beast was not a dozen\\nyards distant. She was just beginning a new experience  a real\\nand horrifying terror in which her blood curdled, her heart gave a\\ntremendous leap and then stood still, and she wanted to fly, but was\\nrooted to the spot  when Dale returned to her side.\\n\\n“That's a pesky porcupine,” he whispered. “Almost crawled over you. He\\nsure would have stuck you full of quills.”\\n\\nWhereupon he threw a stick at the animal. It bounced straight up to turn\\nround with startling quickness, and it gave forth a rattling sound; then\\nit crawled out of sight.\\n\\n“Por  cu  pine!” whispered Bo, pantingly. “It might  as well  have\\nbeen  an elephant!”\\n\\nHelen uttered a long, eloquent sigh. She would not have cared to\\ndescribe her emotions at sight of a harmless hedgehog.\\n\\n“Listen!” warned Dale, very low. His big hand closed over Helen's\\ngauntleted one. “There you have  the real cry of the wild.”\\n\\nSharp and cold on the night air split the cry of a wolf, distant, yet\\nwonderfully distinct. How wild and mournful and hungry! How marvelously\\npure! Helen shuddered through all her frame with the thrill of its\\nmusic, the wild and unutterable and deep emotions it aroused. Again\\na sound of this forest had pierced beyond her life, back into the dim\\nremote past from which she had come.\\n\\nThe cry was not repeated. The coyotes were still. And silence fell,\\nabsolutely unbroken.\\n\\nDale nudged Helen, and then reached over to give Bo a tap. He was\\npeering keenly ahead and his strained intensity could be felt. Helen\\nlooked with all her might and she saw the shadowy gray forms of the\\ncoyotes skulk away, out of the moonlight into the gloom of the woods,\\nwhere they disappeared. Not only Dale's intensity, but the very silence,\\nthe wildness of the moment and place, seemed fraught with wonderful\\npotency. Bo must have felt it, too, for she was trembling all over, and\\nholding tightly to Helen, and breathing quick and fast.\\n\\n“A huh!” muttered Dale, under his breath.\\n\\nHelen caught the relief and certainty in his exclamation, and she\\ndivined, then, something of what the moment must have been to a hunter.\\n\\nThen her roving, alert glance was arrested by a looming gray shadow\\ncoming out of the forest. It moved, but surely that huge thing could not\\nbe a bear. It passed out of gloom into silver moonlight. Helen's heart\\nbounded. For it was a great frosty coated bear lumbering along toward\\nthe dead horse. Instinctively Helen's hand sought the arm of the hunter.\\nIt felt like iron under a rippling surface. The touch eased away the\\noppression over her lungs, the tightness of her throat. What must have\\nbeen fear left her, and only a powerful excitement remained. A sharp\\nexpulsion of breath from Bo and a violent jerk of her frame were signs\\nthat she had sighted the grizzly.\\n\\nIn the moonlight he looked of immense size, and that wild park with\\nthe gloomy blackness of forest furnished a fit setting for him. Helen's\\nquick mind, so taken up with emotion, still had a thought for the wonder\\nand the meaning of that scene. She wanted the bear killed, yet that\\nseemed a pity.\\n\\nHe had a wagging, rolling, slow walk which took several moments to reach\\nhis quarry. When at length he reached it he walked around with sniffs\\nplainly heard and then a cross growl. Evidently he had discovered that\\nhis meal had been messed over. As a whole the big bear could be seen\\ndistinctly, but only in outline and color. The distance was perhaps two\\nhundred yards. Then it looked as if he had begun to tug at the carcass.\\nIndeed, he was dragging it, very slowly, but surely.\\n\\n“Look at that!” whispered Dale. “If he ain't strong!... Reckon I'll have\\nto stop him.”\\n\\nThe grizzly, however, stopped of his own accord, just outside of the\\nshadow line of the forest. Then he hunched in a big frosty heap over his\\nprey and began to tear and rend.\\n\\n“Jess was a mighty good horse,” muttered Dale, grimly; “too good to make\\na meal for a hog silvertip.”\\n\\nThen the hunter silently rose to a kneeling position, swinging the\\nrifle in front of him. He glanced up into the low branches of the tree\\noverhead.\\n\\n“Girls, there's no tellin' what a grizzly will do. If I yell, you climb\\nup in this tree, an' do it quick.”\\n\\nWith that he leveled the rifle, resting his left elbow on his knee. The\\nfront end of the rifle, reaching out of the shade, shone silver in the\\nmoonlight. Man and weapon became still as stone. Helen held her breath.\\nBut Dale relaxed, lowering the barrel.\\n\\n“Can't see the sights very well,” he whispered, shaking his head.\\n“Remember, now  if I yell you climb!”\\n\\nAgain he aimed and slowly grew rigid. Helen could not take her\\nfascinated eyes off him. He knelt, bareheaded, and in the shadow she\\ncould make out the gleam of his clear cut profile, stern and cold.\\n\\nA streak of fire and a heavy report startled her. Then she heard the\\nbullet hit. Shifting her glance, she saw the bear lurch with convulsive\\naction, rearing on his hind legs. Loud clicking snaps must have been a\\nclashing of his jaws in rage. But there was no other sound. Then again\\nDale's heavy gun boomed. Helen heard again that singular spatting thud\\nof striking lead. The bear went down with a flop as if he had been dealt\\na terrific blow. But just as quickly he was up on all fours and began\\nto whirl with hoarse, savage bawls of agony and fury. His action quickly\\ncarried him out of the moonlight into the shadow, where he disappeared.\\nThere the bawls gave place to gnashing snarls, and crashings in the\\nbrush, and snapping of branches, as he made his way into the forest.\\n\\n“Sure he's mad,” said Dale, rising to his feet. “An' I reckon hard hit.\\nBut I won't follow him to night.”\\n\\nBoth the girls got up, and Helen found she was shaky on her feet and\\nvery cold.\\n\\n“Oh h, wasn't  it  won wonder ful!” cried Bo.\\n\\n“Are you scared? Your teeth are chatterin',” queried Dale.\\n\\n“I'm  cold.”\\n\\n“Well, it sure is cold, all right,” he responded. “Now the fun's over,\\nyou'll feel it... Nell, you're froze, too?”\\n\\nHelen nodded. She was, indeed, as cold as she had ever been before. But\\nthat did not prevent a strange warmness along her veins and a quickened\\npulse, the cause of which she did not conjecture.\\n\\n“Let's rustle,” said Dale, and led the way out of the wood and skirted\\nits edge around to the slope. There they climbed to the flat, and went\\nthrough the straggling line of trees to where the horses were tethered.\\n\\nUp here the wind began to blow, not hard through the forest, but still\\nstrong and steady out in the open, and bitterly cold. Dale helped Bo to\\nmount, and then Helen.\\n\\n“I'm  numb,” she said. “I'll fall off  sure.”\\n\\n“No. You'll be warm in a jiffy,” he replied, “because we'll ride some\\ngoin' back. Let Ranger pick the way an' you hang on.”\\n\\nWith Ranger's first jump Helen's blood began to run. Out he shot, his\\nlean, dark head beside Dale's horse. The wild park lay clear and bright\\nin the moonlight, with strange, silvery radiance on the grass. The\\npatches of timber, like spired black islands in a moon blanched lake,\\nseemed to harbor shadows, and places for bears to hide, ready to spring\\nout. As Helen neared each little grove her pulses shook and her heart\\nbeat. Half a mile of rapid riding burned out the cold. And all seemed\\nglorious  the sailing moon, white in a dark blue sky, the white,\\npassionless stars, so solemn, so far away, the beckoning fringe of\\nforest land at once mysterious and friendly, and the fleet horses,\\nrunning with soft, rhythmic thuds over the grass, leaping the ditches\\nand the hollows, making the bitter wind sting and cut. Coming up\\nthat park the ride had been long; going back was as short as it was\\nthrilling. In Helen, experiences gathered realization slowly, and it\\nwas this swift ride, the horses neck and neck, and all the wildness and\\nbeauty, that completed the slow, insidious work of years. The tears\\nof excitement froze on her cheeks and her heart heaved full. All that\\npertained to this night got into her blood. It was only to feel, to live\\nnow, but it could be understood and remembered forever afterward.\\n\\nDale's horse, a little in advance, sailed over a ditch. Ranger made a\\nsplendid leap, but he alighted among some grassy tufts and fell. Helen\\nshot over his head. She struck lengthwise, her arms stretched, and slid\\nhard to a shocking impact that stunned her.\\n\\nBo's scream rang in her ears; she felt the wet grass under her face and\\nthen the strong hands that lifted her. Dale loomed over her, bending\\ndown to look into her face; Bo was clutching her with frantic hands. And\\nHelen could only gasp. Her breast seemed caved in. The need to breathe\\nwas torture.\\n\\n“Nell!  you're not hurt. You fell light, like a feather. All grass\\nhere... You can't be hurt!” said Dale, sharply.\\n\\nHis anxious voice penetrated beyond her hearing, and his strong hands\\nwent swiftly over her arms and shoulders, feeling for broken bones.\\n\\n“Just had the wind knocked out of you,” went on Dale. “It feels awful,\\nbut it's nothin'.”\\n\\nHelen got a little air, that was like hot pin points in her lungs, and\\nthen a deeper breath, and then full, gasping respiration.\\n\\n“I guess  I'm not hurt  not a bit,” she choked out.\\n\\n“You sure had a header. Never saw a prettier spill. Ranger doesn't do\\nthat often. I reckon we were travelin' too fast. But it was fun, don't\\nyou think?”\\n\\nIt was Bo who answered. “Oh, glorious!... But, gee! I was scared.”\\n\\nDale still held Helen's hands. She released them while looking up at\\nhim. The moment was realization for her of what for days had been a\\nvague, sweet uncertainty, becoming near and strange, disturbing and\\npresent. This accident had been a sudden, violent end to the wonderful\\nride. But its effect, the knowledge of what had got into her blood,\\nwould never change. And inseparable from it was this man of the forest.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nOn the next morning Helen was awakened by what she imagined had been a\\ndream of some one shouting. With a start she sat up. The sunshine showed\\npink and gold on the ragged spruce line of the mountain rims. Bo was on\\nher knees, braiding her hair with shaking hands, and at the same time\\ntrying to peep out.\\n\\nAnd the echoes of a ringing cry were cracking back from the cliffs. That\\nhad been Dale's voice.\\n\\n“Nell! Nell! Wake up!” called Bo, wildly. “Oh, some one's come! Horses\\nand men!”\\n\\nHelen got to her knees and peered out over Bo's shoulder. Dale, standing\\ntall and striking beside the campfire, was waving his sombrero. Away\\ndown the open edge of the park came a string of pack burros with mounted\\nmen behind. In the foremost rider Helen recognized Roy Beeman.\\n\\n“That first one's Roy!” she exclaimed. “I'd never forget him on a\\nhorse... Bo, it must mean Uncle Al's come!”\\n\\n“Sure! We're born lucky. Here we are safe and sound  and all this grand\\ncamp trip... Look at the cowboys... LOOK! Oh, maybe this isn't great!”\\n babbled Bo.\\n\\nDale wheeled to see the girls peeping out.\\n\\n“It's time you're up!” he called. “Your uncle Al is here.”\\n\\nFor an instant after Helen sank back out of Dale's sight she sat there\\nperfectly motionless, so struck was she by the singular tone of Dale's\\nvoice. She imagined that he regretted what this visiting cavalcade of\\nhorsemen meant  they had come to take her to her ranch in Pine. Helen's\\nheart suddenly began to beat fast, but thickly, as if muffled within her\\nbreast.\\n\\n“Hurry now, girls,” called Dale.\\n\\nBo was already out, kneeling on the flat stone at the little brook,\\nsplashing water in a great hurry. Helen's hands trembled so that she\\ncould scarcely lace her boots or brush her hair, and she was long behind\\nBo in making herself presentable. When Helen stepped out, a short,\\npowerfully built man in coarse garb and heavy boots stood holding Bo's\\nhands.\\n\\n“Wal, wal! You favor the Rayners,” he was saying, “I remember your dad,\\nan' a fine feller he was.”\\n\\nBeside them stood Dale and Roy, and beyond was a group of horses and\\nriders.\\n\\n“Uncle, here comes Nell,” said Bo, softly.\\n\\n“Aw!” The old cattle man breathed hard as he turned.\\n\\nHelen hurried. She had not expected to remember this uncle, but one look\\ninto the brown, beaming face, with the blue eyes flashing, yet sad, and\\nshe recognized him, at the same instant recalling her mother.\\n\\nHe held out his arms to receive her.\\n\\n“Nell Auchincloss all over again!” he exclaimed, in deep voice, as he\\nkissed her. “I'd have knowed you anywhere!”\\n\\n“Uncle Al!” murmured Helen. “I remember you  though I was only four.”\\n\\n“Wal, wal,  that's fine,” he replied. “I remember you straddled my knee\\nonce, an' your hair was brighter  an' curly. It ain't neither now...\\nSixteen years! An' you're twenty now? What a fine, broad shouldered girl\\nyou are! An', Nell, you're the handsomest Auchincloss I ever seen!”\\n\\nHelen found herself blushing, and withdrew her hands from his as Roy\\nstepped forward to pay his respects. He stood bareheaded, lean and tall,\\nwith neither his clear eyes nor his still face, nor the proffered hand\\nexpressing anything of the proven quality of fidelity, of achievement,\\nthat Helen sensed in him.\\n\\n“Howdy, Miss Helen? Howdy, Bo?” he said. “You all both look fine an'\\nbrown... I reckon I was shore slow rustlin' your uncle Al up here. But\\nI was figgerin' you'd like Milt's camp for a while.”\\n\\n“We sure did,” replied Bo, archly.\\n\\n“Aw!” breathed Auchincloss, heavily. “Lemme set down.”\\n\\nHe drew the girls to the rustic seat Dale had built for them under the\\nbig pine.\\n\\n“Oh, you must be tired! How  how are you?” asked Helen, anxiously.\\n\\n“Tired! Wal, if I am it's jest this here minit. When Joe Beeman rode\\nin on me with thet news of you  wal, I jest fergot I was a worn out old\\nhoss. Haven't felt so good in years. Mebbe two such young an' pretty\\nnieces will make a new man of me.”\\n\\n“Uncle Al, you look strong and well to me,” said Bo. “And young, too,\\nand  ”\\n\\n“Haw! Haw! Thet 'll do,” interrupted Al. “I see through you. What you'll\\ndo to Uncle Al will be aplenty... Yes, girls, I'm feelin' fine. But\\nstrange  strange! Mebbe thet's my joy at seein' you safe  safe when I\\nfeared so thet damned greaser Beasley  ”\\n\\nIn Helen's grave gaze his face changed swiftly  and all the serried\\nyears of toil and battle and privation showed, with something that was\\nnot age, nor resignation, yet as tragic as both.\\n\\n“Wal, never mind him  now,” he added, slowly, and the warmer light\\nreturned to his face. “Dale  come here.”\\n\\nThe hunter stepped closer.\\n\\n“I reckon I owe you more 'n I can ever pay,” said Auchincloss, with an\\narm around each niece.\\n\\n“No, Al, you don't owe me anythin',” returned Dale, thoughtfully, as he\\nlooked away.\\n\\n“A huh!” grunted Al. “You hear him, girls... Now listen, you wild\\nhunter. An' you girls listen... Milt, I never thought you much good,\\n'cept for the wilds. But I reckon I'll have to swallow thet. I do.\\nComin' to me as you did  an' after bein' druv off  keepin' your council\\nan' savin' my girls from thet hold up, wal, it's the biggest deal any\\nman ever did for me... An' I'm ashamed of my hard feelin's, an' here's\\nmy hand.”\\n\\n“Thanks, Al,” replied Dale, with his fleeting smile, and he met the\\nproffered hand. “Now, will you be makin' camp here?”\\n\\n“Wal, no. I'll rest a little, an' you can pack the girls' outfit  then\\nwe'll go. Sure you're goin' with us?”\\n\\n“I'll call the girls to breakfast,” replied Dale, and he moved away\\nwithout answering Auchincloss's query.\\n\\nHelen divined that Dale did not mean to go down to Pine with them, and\\nthe knowledge gave her a blank feeling of surprise. Had she expected him\\nto go?\\n\\n“Come here, Jeff,” called Al, to one of his men.\\n\\nA short, bow legged horseman with dusty garb and sun bleached face\\nhobbled forth from the group. He was not young, but he had a boyish grin\\nand bright little eyes. Awkwardly he doffed his slouch sombrero.\\n\\n“Jeff, shake hands with my nieces,” said Al. “This 's Helen, an' your\\nboss from now on. An' this 's Bo, fer short. Her name was Nancy, but\\nwhen she lay a baby in her cradle I called her Bo Peep, an' the name's\\nstuck... Girls, this here's my foreman, Jeff Mulvey, who's been with me\\ntwenty years.”\\n\\nThe introduction caused embarrassment to all three principals,\\nparticularly to Jeff.\\n\\n“Jeff, throw the packs an' saddles fer a rest,” was Al's order to his\\nforeman.\\n\\n“Nell, reckon you'll have fun bossin' thet outfit,” chuckled Al. “None\\nof 'em's got a wife. Lot of scalawags they are; no women would have\\nthem!”\\n\\n“Uncle, I hope I'll never have to be their boss,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“Wal, you're goin' to be, right off,” declared Al. “They ain't a bad\\nlot, after all. An' I got a likely new man.”\\n\\nWith that he turned to Bo, and, after studying her pretty face,\\nhe asked, in apparently severe tone, “Did you send a cowboy named\\nCarmichael to ask me for a job?”\\n\\nBo looked quite startled.\\n\\n“Carmichael! Why, Uncle, I never heard that name before,” replied Bo,\\nbewilderedly.\\n\\n“A huh! Reckoned the young rascal was lyin',” said Auchincloss. “But I\\nliked the fellar's looks an' so let him stay.”\\n\\nThen the rancher turned to the group of lounging riders.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, come here,” he ordered, in a loud voice.\\n\\nHelen thrilled at sight of a tall, superbly built cowboy reluctantly\\ndetaching himself from the group. He had a red bronze face, young like a\\nboy's. Helen recognized it, and the flowing red scarf, and the swinging\\ngun, and the slow, spur clinking gait. No other than Bo's Las Vegas\\ncowboy admirer!\\n\\nThen Helen flashed a look at Bo, which look gave her a delicious,\\nalmost irresistible desire to laugh. That young lady also recognized the\\nreluctant individual approaching with flushed and downcast face. Helen\\nrecorded her first experience of Bo's utter discomfiture. Bo turned\\nwhite then red as a rose.\\n\\n“Say, my niece said she never heard of the name Carmichael,” declared\\nAl, severely, as the cowboy halted before him. Helen knew her uncle had\\nthe repute of dealing hard with his men, but here she was reassured and\\npleased at the twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n“Shore, boss, I can't help thet,” drawled the cowboy. “It's good old\\nTexas stock.”\\n\\nHe did not appear shamefaced now, but just as cool, easy, clear eyed,\\nand lazy as the day Helen had liked his warm young face and intent gaze.\\n\\n“Texas! You fellars from the Pan Handle are always hollerin' Texas.\\nI never seen thet Texans had any one else beat  say from Missouri,”\\n returned Al, testily.\\n\\nCarmichael maintained a discreet silence, and carefully avoided looking\\nat the girls.\\n\\n“Wal, reckon we'll all call you Las Vegas, anyway,” continued the\\nrancher. “Didn't you say my niece sent you to me for a job?”\\n\\nWhereupon Carmichael's easy manner vanished.\\n\\n“Now, boss, shore my memory's pore,” he said. “I only says  ”\\n\\n“Don't tell me thet. My memory's not p o r e,” replied Al, mimicking\\nthe drawl. “What you said was thet my niece would speak a good word for\\nyou.”\\n\\nHere Carmichael stole a timid glance at Bo, the result of which was\\nto render him utterly crestfallen. Not improbably he had taken Bo's\\nexpression to mean something it did not, for Helen read it as a mingling\\nof consternation and fright. Her eyes were big and blazing; a red spot\\nwas growing in each cheek as she gathered strength from his confusion.\\n\\n“Well, didn't you?” demanded Al.\\n\\nFrom the glance the old rancher shot from the cowboy to the others of\\nhis employ it seemed to Helen that they were having fun at Carmichael's\\nexpense.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, I did,” suddenly replied the cowboy.\\n\\n“A huh! All right, here's my niece. Now see thet she speaks the good\\nword.”\\n\\nCarmichael looked at Bo and Bo looked at him. Their glances were\\nstrange, wondering, and they grew shy. Bo dropped hers. The cowboy\\napparently forgot what had been demanded of him.\\n\\nHelen put a hand on the old rancher's arm.\\n\\n“Uncle, what happened was my fault,” she said. “The train stopped at Las\\nVegas. This young man saw us at the open window. He must have guessed we\\nwere lonely, homesick girls, getting lost in the West. For he spoke to\\nus  nice and friendly. He knew of you. And he asked, in what I took\\nfor fun, if we thought you would give him a job. And I replied, just to\\ntease Bo, that she would surely speak a good word for him.”\\n\\n“Haw! Haw! So thet's it,” replied Al, and he turned to Bo with merry\\neyes. “Wal, I kept this here Las Vegas Carmichael on his say so. Come on\\nwith your good word, unless you want to see him lose his job.”\\n\\nBo did not grasp her uncle's bantering, because she was seriously gazing\\nat the cowboy. But she had grasped something.\\n\\n“He  he was the first person  out West  to speak kindly to us,” she\\nsaid, facing her uncle.\\n\\n“Wal, thet's a pretty good word, but it ain't enough,” responded Al.\\n\\nSubdued laughter came from the listening group. Carmichael shifted from\\nside to side.\\n\\n“He  he looks as if he might ride a horse well,” ventured Bo.\\n\\n“Best hossman I ever seen,” agreed Al, heartily.\\n\\n“And  and shoot?” added Bo, hopefully.\\n\\n“Bo, he packs thet gun low, like Jim Wilson an' all them Texas\\ngun fighters. Reckon thet ain't no good word.”\\n\\n“Then  I'll vouch for him,” said Bo, with finality.\\n\\n“Thet settles it.” Auchincloss turned to the cowboy. “Las Vegas, you're\\na stranger to us. But you're welcome to a place in the outfit an' I hope\\nyou won't never disappoint us.”\\n\\nAuchincloss's tone, passing from jest to earnest, betrayed to Helen the\\nold rancher's need of new and true men, and hinted of trying days to\\ncome.\\n\\nCarmichael stood before Bo, sombrero in hand, rolling it round and\\nround, manifestly bursting with words he could not speak. And the girl\\nlooked very young and sweet with her flushed face and shining eyes.\\nHelen saw in the moment more than that little by play of confusion.\\n\\n“Miss  Miss Rayner  I shore  am obliged,” he stammered, presently.\\n\\n“You're very welcome,” she replied, softly. “I  I got on the next\\ntrain,” he added.\\n\\nWhen he said that Bo was looking straight at him, but she seemed not to\\nhave heard.\\n\\n“What's your name?” suddenly she asked.\\n\\n“Carmichael.”\\n\\n“I heard that. But didn't uncle call you Las Vegas?”\\n\\n“Shore. But it wasn't my fault. Thet cow punchin' outfit saddled it on\\nme, right off. They Don't know no better. Shore I jest won't answer to\\nthet handle... Now  Miss Bo  my real name is Tom.”\\n\\n“I simply could not call you  any name but Las Vegas,” replied Bo, very\\nsweetly.\\n\\n“But  beggin' your pardon  I  I don't like thet,” blustered Carmichael.\\n\\n“People often get called names  they don't like,” she said, with deep\\nintent.\\n\\nThe cowboy blushed scarlet. Helen as well as he got Bo's inference to\\nthat last audacious epithet he had boldly called out as the train was\\nleaving Las Vegas. She also sensed something of the disaster in store\\nfor Mr. Carmichael. Just then the embarrassed young man was saved by\\nDale's call to the girls to come to breakfast.\\n\\nThat meal, the last for Helen in Paradise Park, gave rise to a strange\\nand inexplicable restraint. She had little to say. Bo was in the highest\\nspirits, teasing the pets, joking with her uncle and Roy, and even\\npoking fun at Dale. The hunter seemed somewhat somber. Roy was his usual\\ndry, genial self. And Auchincloss, who sat near by, was an interested\\nspectator. When Tom put in an appearance, lounging with his feline grace\\ninto the camp, as if he knew he was a privileged pet, the rancher could\\nscarcely contain himself.\\n\\n“Dale, it's thet damn cougar!” he ejaculated.\\n\\n“Sure, that's Tom.”\\n\\n“He ought to be corralled or chained. I've no use for cougars,”\\n protested Al.\\n\\n“Tom is as tame an' safe as a kitten.”\\n\\n“A huh! Wal, you tell thet to the girls if you like. But not me! I'm an\\nold hoss, I am.”\\n\\n“Uncle Al, Tom sleeps curled up at the foot of my bed,” said Bo.\\n\\n“Aw  what?”\\n\\n“Honest Injun,” she responded. “Well, isn't it so?”\\n\\nHelen smilingly nodded her corroboration. Then Bo called Tom to her and\\nmade him lie with his head on his stretched paws, right beside her, and\\nbeg for bits to eat.\\n\\n“Wal! I'd never have believed thet!” exclaimed Al, shaking his big head.\\n“Dale, it's one on me. I've had them big cats foller me on the trails,\\nthrough the woods, moonlight an' dark. An' I've heard 'em let out thet\\nawful cry. They ain't any wild sound on earth thet can beat a cougar's.\\nDoes this Tom ever let out one of them wails?”\\n\\n“Sometimes at night,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Wal, excuse me. Hope you don't fetch the yaller rascal down to Pine.”\\n\\n“I won't.”\\n\\n“What'll you do with this menagerie?”\\n\\nDale regarded the rancher attentively. “Reckon, Al, I'll take care of\\nthem.”\\n\\n“But you're goin' down to my ranch.”\\n\\n“What for?”\\n\\nAl scratched his head and gazed perplexedly at the hunter. “Wal, ain't\\nit customary to visit friends?”\\n\\n“Thanks, Al. Next time I ride down Pine way  in the spring,\\nperhaps  I'll run over an' see how you are.”\\n\\n“Spring!” ejaculated Auchincloss. Then he shook his head sadly and a\\nfar away look filmed his eyes. “Reckon you'd call some late.”\\n\\n“Al, you'll get well now. These, girls  now  they'll cure you. Reckon I\\nnever saw you look so good.”\\n\\nAuchincloss did not press his point farther at that time, but after the\\nmeal, when the other men came to see Dale's camp and pets, Helen's quick\\nears caught the renewal of the subject.\\n\\n“I'm askin' you  will you come?” Auchincloss said, low and eagerly.\\n\\n“No. I wouldn't fit in down there,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Milt, talk sense. You can't go on forever huntin' bear an' tamin'\\ncats,” protested the old rancher.\\n\\n“Why not?” asked the hunter, thoughtfully.\\n\\nAuchincloss stood up and, shaking himself as if to ward off his testy\\ntemper, he put a hand on Dale's arm.\\n\\n“One reason is you're needed in Pine.”\\n\\n“How? Who needs me?”\\n\\n“I do. I'm playin' out fast. An' Beasley's my enemy. The ranch an' all I\\ngot will go to Nell. Thet ranch will have to be run by a man an' HELD\\nby a man. Do you savvy? It's a big job. An' I'm offerin' to make you my\\nforeman right now.”\\n\\n“Al, you sort of take my breath,” replied Dale. “An' I'm sure grateful.\\nBut the fact is, even if I could handle the job, I  I don't believe I'd\\nwant to.”\\n\\n“Make yourself want to, then. Thet 'd soon come. You'd get interested.\\nThis country will develop. I seen thet years ago. The government is\\ngoin' to chase the Apaches out of here. Soon homesteaders will be\\nflockin' in. Big future, Dale. You want to get in now. An'  ”\\n\\nHere Auchincloss hesitated, then spoke lower:\\n\\n“An' take your chance with the girl!... I'll be on your side.”\\n\\nA slight vibrating start ran over Dale's stalwart form.\\n\\n“Al  you're plumb dotty!” he exclaimed.\\n\\n“Dotty! Me? Dotty!” ejaculated Auchincloss. Then he swore. “In a minit\\nI'll tell you what you are.”\\n\\n“But, Al, that talk's so  so  like an old fool's.”\\n\\n“Huh! An' why so?”\\n\\n“Because that  wonderful girl would never look at me,” Dale replied,\\nsimply.\\n\\n“I seen her lookin' already,” declared Al, bluntly.\\n\\nDale shook his head as if arguing with the old rancher was hopeless.\\n\\n“Never mind thet,” went on Al. “Mebbe I am a dotty old fool  'specially\\nfor takin' a shine to you. But I say again  will you come down to Pine\\nand be my foreman?”\\n\\n“No,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Milt, I've no son  an' I'm  afraid of Beasley.” This was uttered in an\\nagitated whisper.\\n\\n“Al, you make me ashamed,” said Dale, hoarsely. “I can't come. I've no\\nnerve.”\\n\\n“You've no what?”\\n\\n“Al, I don't know what's wrong with me. But I'm afraid I'd find out if I\\ncame down there.”\\n\\n“A huh! It's the girl!”\\n\\n“I don't know, but I'm afraid so. An' I won't come.”\\n\\n“Aw yes, you will  ”\\n\\nHelen rose with beating heart and tingling ears, and moved away out of\\nhearing. She had listened too long to what had not been intended for her\\nears, yet she could not be sorry. She walked a few rods along the brook,\\nout from under the pines, and, standing in the open edge of the park,\\nshe felt the beautiful scene still her agitation. The following\\nmoments, then, were the happiest she had spent in Paradise Park, and the\\nprofoundest of her whole life.\\n\\nPresently her uncle called her.\\n\\n“Nell, this here hunter wants to give you thet black hoss. An' I say you\\ntake him.”\\n\\n“Ranger deserves better care than I can give him,” said Dale. “He runs\\nfree in the woods most of the time. I'd be obliged if she'd have him.\\nAn' the hound, Pedro, too.”\\n\\nBo swept a saucy glance from Dale to her sister.\\n\\n“Sure she'll have Ranger. Just offer him to ME!”\\n\\nDale stood there expectantly, holding a blanket in his hand, ready to\\nsaddle the horse. Carmichael walked around Ranger with that appraising\\neye so keen in cowboys.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, do you know anything about horses?” asked Bo.\\n\\n“Me! Wal, if you ever buy or trade a hoss you shore have me there,”\\n replied Carmichael.\\n\\n“What do you think of Ranger?” went on Bo.\\n\\n“Shore I'd buy him sudden, if I could.”\\n\\n“Mr. Las Vegas, you're too late,” asserted Helen, as she advanced to lay\\na hand on the horse.\\n\\n“Ranger is mine.”\\n\\nDale smoothed out the blanket and, folding it, he threw it over the\\nhorse; and then with one powerful swing he set the saddle in place.\\n\\n“Thank you very much for him,” said Helen, softly.\\n\\n“You're welcome, an' I'm sure glad,” responded Dale, and then, after a\\nfew deft, strong pulls at the straps, he continued. “There, he's ready\\nfor you.”\\n\\nWith that he laid an arm over the saddle, and faced Helen as she stood\\npatting and smoothing Ranger. Helen, strong and calm now, in feminine\\npossession of her secret and his, as well as her composure, looked\\nfrankly and steadily at Dale. He seemed composed, too, yet the bronze of\\nhis fine face was a trifle pale.\\n\\n“But I can't thank you  I'll never be able to repay you  for your\\nservice to me and my sister,” said Helen.\\n\\n“I reckon you needn't try,” Dale returned. “An' my service, as you call\\nit, has been good for me.”\\n\\n“Are you going down to Pine with us?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“But you will come soon?”\\n\\n“Not very soon, I reckon,” he replied, and averted his gaze.\\n\\n“When?”\\n\\n“Hardly before spring.”\\n\\n“Spring?... That is a long time. Won't you come to see me sooner than\\nthat?”\\n\\n“If I can get down to Pine.”\\n\\n“You're the first friend I've made in the West,” said Helen, earnestly.\\n\\n“You'll make many more  an' I reckon soon forget him you called the man\\nof the forest.”\\n\\n“I never forget any of my friends. And you've been the  the biggest\\nfriend I ever had.”\\n\\n“I'll be proud to remember.”\\n\\n“But will you remember  will you promise to come to Pine?”\\n\\n“I reckon.”\\n\\n“Thank you. All's well, then... My friend, goodby.”\\n\\n“Good by,” he said, clasping her hand. His glance was clear, warm,\\nbeautiful, yet it was sad.\\n\\nAuchincloss's hearty voice broke the spell. Then Helen saw that the\\nothers were mounted. Bo had ridden up close; her face was earnest\\nand happy and grieved all at once, as she bade good by to Dale. The\\npack burros were hobbling along toward the green slope. Helen was the\\nlast to mount, but Roy was the last to leave the hunter. Pedro came\\nreluctantly.\\n\\nIt was a merry, singing train which climbed that brown odorous trail,\\nunder the dark spruces. Helen assuredly was happy, yet a pang abided in\\nher breast.\\n\\nShe remembered that half way up the slope there was a turn in the trail\\nwhere it came out upon an open bluff. The time seemed long, but at last\\nshe got there. And she checked Ranger so as to have a moment's gaze down\\ninto the park.\\n\\nIt yawned there, a dark green and bright gold gulf, asleep under a\\nwestering sun, exquisite, wild, lonesome. Then she saw Dale standing in\\nthe open space between the pines and the spruces. He waved to her. And\\nshe returned the salute.\\n\\nRoy caught up with her then and halted his horse. He waved his sombrero\\nto Dale and let out a piercing yell that awoke the sleeping echoes,\\nsplitting strangely from cliff to cliff.\\n\\n“Shore Milt never knowed what it was to be lonesome,” said Roy, as if\\nthinking aloud. “But he'll know now.”\\n\\nRanger stepped out of his own accord and, turning off the ledge, entered\\nthe spruce forest. Helen lost sight of Paradise Park. For hours then\\nshe rode along a shady, fragrant trail, seeing the beauty of color and\\nwildness, hearing the murmur and rush and roar of water, but all the\\nwhile her mind revolved the sweet and momentous realization which had\\nthrilled her  that the hunter, this strange man of the forest, so deeply\\nversed in nature and so unfamiliar with emotion, aloof and simple and\\nstrong like the elements which had developed him, had fallen in love\\nwith her and did not know it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nDale stood with face and arm upraised, and he watched Helen ride off the\\nledge to disappear in the forest. That vast spruce slope seemed to have\\nswallowed her. She was gone! Slowly Dale lowered his arm with gesture\\nexpressive of a strange finality, an eloquent despair, of which he was\\nunconscious.\\n\\nHe turned to the park, to his camp, and the many duties of a hunter. The\\npark did not seem the same, nor his home, nor his work.\\n\\n“I reckon this feelin's natural,” he soliloquized, resignedly, “but it's\\nsure queer for me. That's what comes of makin' friends. Nell an' Bo,\\nnow, they made a difference, an' a difference I never knew before.”\\n\\nHe calculated that this difference had been simply one of\\nresponsibility, and then the charm and liveliness of the companionship\\nof girls, and finally friendship. These would pass now that the causes\\nwere removed.\\n\\nBefore he had worked an hour around camp he realized a change had come,\\nbut it was not the one anticipated. Always before he had put his mind on\\nhis tasks, whatever they might be; now he worked while his thoughts were\\nstrangely involved.\\n\\nThe little bear cub whined at his heels; the tame deer seemed to regard\\nhim with deep, questioning eyes, the big cougar padded softly here and\\nthere as if searching for something.\\n\\n“You all miss them  now  I reckon,” said Dale. “Well, they're gone an'\\nyou'll have to get along with me.”\\n\\nSome vague approach to irritation with his pets surprised him. Presently\\nhe grew both irritated and surprised with himself  a state of mind\\ntotally unfamiliar. Several times, as old habit brought momentary\\nabstraction, he found himself suddenly looking around for Helen and\\nBo. And each time the shock grew stronger. They were gone, but their\\npresence lingered. After his camp chores were completed he went over to\\npull down the lean to which the girls had utilized as a tent. The spruce\\nboughs had dried out brown and sear; the wind had blown the roof awry;\\nthe sides were leaning in. As there was now no further use for\\nthis little habitation, he might better pull it down. Dale did not\\nacknowledge that his gaze had involuntarily wandered toward it many\\ntimes. Therefore he strode over with the intention of destroying it.\\n\\nFor the first time since Roy and he had built the lean to he stepped\\ninside. Nothing was more certain than the fact that he experienced a\\nstrange sensation, perfectly incomprehensible to him. The blankets\\nlay there on the spruce boughs, disarranged and thrown back by hurried\\nhands, yet still holding something of round folds where the slender\\nforms had nestled. A black scarf often worn by Bo lay covering the\\npillow of pine needles; a red ribbon that Helen had worn on her hair\\nhung from a twig. These articles were all that had been forgotten. Dale\\ngazed at them attentively, then at the blankets, and all around the\\nfragrant little shelter; and he stepped outside with an uncomfortable\\nknowledge that he could not destroy the place where Helen and Bo had\\nspent so many hours.\\n\\nWhereupon, in studious mood, Dale took up his rifle and strode out to\\nhunt. His winter supply of venison had not yet been laid in. Action\\nsuited his mood; he climbed far and passed by many a watching buck\\nto slay which seemed murder; at last he jumped one that was wild and\\nbounded away. This he shot, and set himself a Herculean task in packing\\nthe whole carcass back to camp. Burdened thus, he staggered under the\\ntrees, sweating freely, many times laboring for breath, aching with\\ntoil, until at last he had reached camp. There he slid the deer carcass\\noff his shoulders, and, standing over it, he gazed down while his breast\\nlabored. It was one of the finest young bucks he had ever seen. But\\nneither in stalking it, nor making a wonderful shot, nor in packing home\\na weight that would have burdened two men, nor in gazing down at his\\nbeautiful quarry, did Dale experience any of the old joy of the hunter.\\n\\n“I'm a little off my feed,” he mused, as he wiped sweat from his heated\\nface. “Maybe a little dotty, as I called Al. But that'll pass.”\\n\\nWhatever his state, it did not pass. As of old, after a long day's hunt,\\nhe reclined beside the camp fire and watched the golden sunset glows\\nchange on the ramparts; as of old he laid a hand on the soft, furry head\\nof the pet cougar; as of old he watched the gold change to red and then\\nto dark, and twilight fall like a blanket; as of old he listened to\\nthe dreamy, lulling murmur of the water fall. The old familiar beauty,\\nwildness, silence, and loneliness were there, but the old content seemed\\nstrangely gone.\\n\\nSoberly he confessed then that he missed the happy company of the girls.\\nHe did not distinguish Helen from Bo in his slow introspection. When\\nhe sought his bed he did not at once fall to sleep. Always, after a\\nfew moments of wakefulness, while the silence settled down or the wind\\nmoaned through the pines, he had fallen asleep. This night he found\\ndifferent. Though he was tired, sleep would not soon come. The\\nwilderness, the mountains, the park, the camp  all seemed to have lost\\nsomething. Even the darkness seemed empty. And when at length Dale fell\\nasleep it was to be troubled by restless dreams.\\n\\nUp with the keen edged, steely bright dawn, he went at the his tasks\\nwith the springy stride of the deer stalker.\\n\\nAt the end of that strenuous day, which was singularly full of the old\\nexcitement and action and danger, and of new observations, he was bound\\nto confess that no longer did the chase suffice for him.\\n\\nMany times on the heights that day, with the wind keen in his face, and\\nthe vast green billows of spruce below him, he had found that he was\\ngazing without seeing, halting without object, dreaming as he had never\\ndreamed before.\\n\\nOnce, when a magnificent elk came out upon a rocky ridge and, whistling\\na challenge to invisible rivals, stood there a target to stir any\\nhunter's pulse, Dale did not even raise his rifle. Into his ear just\\nthen rang Helen's voice: “Milt Dale, you are no Indian. Giving yourself\\nto a hunter's wildlife is selfish. It is wrong. You love this lonely\\nlife, but it is not work. Work that does not help others is not a real\\nman's work.”\\n\\nFrom that moment conscience tormented him. It was not what he loved,\\nbut what he ought to do, that counted in the sum of good achieved in the\\nworld. Old Al Auchincloss had been right. Dale was wasting strength and\\nintelligence that should go to do his share in the development of the\\nWest. Now that he had reached maturity, if through his knowledge of\\nnature's law he had come to see the meaning of the strife of men for\\nexistence, for place, for possession, and to hold them in contempt, that\\nwas no reason why he should keep himself aloof from them, from some work\\nthat was needed in an incomprehensible world.\\n\\nDale did not hate work, but he loved freedom. To be alone, to live with\\nnature, to feel the elements, to labor and dream and idle and climb\\nand sleep unhampered by duty, by worry, by restriction, by the petty\\ninterests of men  this had always been his ideal of living. Cowboys,\\nriders, sheep herders, farmers  these toiled on from one place and\\none job to another for the little money doled out to them. Nothing\\nbeautiful, nothing significant had ever existed in that for him. He had\\nworked as a boy at every kind of range work, and of all that humdrum\\nwaste of effort he had liked sawing wood best. Once he had quit a job\\nof branding cattle because the smell of burning hide, the bawl of the\\nterrified calf, had sickened him. If men were honest there would be no\\nneed to scar cattle. He had never in the least desired to own land and\\ndroves of stock, and make deals with ranchmen, deals advantageous to\\nhimself. Why should a man want to make a deal or trade a horse or do a\\npiece of work to another man's disadvantage? Self preservation was the\\nfirst law of life. But as the plants and trees and birds and beasts\\ninterpreted that law, merciless and inevitable as they were, they had\\nneither greed nor dishonesty. They lived by the grand rule of what was\\nbest for the greatest number.\\n\\nBut Dale's philosophy, cold and clear and inevitable, like nature\\nitself, began to be pierced by the human appeal in Helen Rayner's words.\\nWhat did she mean? Not that he should lose his love of the wilderness,\\nbut that he realize himself! Many chance words of that girl had depth.\\nHe was young, strong, intelligent, free from taint of disease or the\\nfever of drink. He could do something for others. Who? If that mattered,\\nthere, for instance, was poor old Mrs. Cass, aged and lame now; there\\nwas Al Auchincloss, dying in his boots, afraid of enemies, and wistful\\nfor his blood and his property to receive the fruit of his labors; there\\nwere the two girls, Helen and Bo, new and strange to the West, about to\\nbe confronted by a big problem of ranch life and rival interests. Dale\\nthought of still more people in the little village of Pine  of others\\nwho had failed, whose lives were hard, who could have been made happier\\nby kindness and assistance.\\n\\nWhat, then, was the duty of Milt Dale to himself? Because men preyed on\\none another and on the weak, should he turn his back upon a so called\\ncivilization or should he grow like them? Clear as a bell came the\\nanswer that his duty was to do neither. And then he saw how the little\\nvillage of Pine, as well as the whole world, needed men like him. He had\\ngone to nature, to the forest, to the wilderness for his development;\\nand all the judgments and efforts of his future would be a result of\\nthat education.\\n\\nThus Dale, lying in the darkness and silence of his lonely park, arrived\\nat a conclusion that he divined was but the beginning of a struggle.\\n\\nIt took long introspection to determine the exact nature of that\\nstruggle, but at length it evolved into the paradox that Helen Rayner\\nhad opened his eyes to his duty as a man, that he accepted it, yet found\\na strange obstacle in the perplexing, tumultuous, sweet fear of ever\\ngoing near her again.\\n\\nSuddenly, then, all his thought revolved around the girl, and, thrown\\noff his balance, he weltered in a wilderness of unfamiliar strange\\nideas.\\n\\nWhen he awoke next day the fight was on in earnest. In his sleep his\\nmind had been active. The idea that greeted him, beautiful as the\\nsunrise, flashed in memory of Auchincloss's significant words, “Take\\nyour chance with the girl!”\\n\\nThe old rancher was in his dotage. He hinted of things beyond the range\\nof possibility. That idea of a chance for Dale remained before his\\nconsciousness only an instant. Stars were unattainable; life could\\nnot be fathomed; the secret of nature did not abide alone on the\\nearth  these theories were not any more impossible of proving than that\\nHelen Rayner might be for him.\\n\\nNevertheless, her strange coming into his life had played havoc, the\\nextent of which he had only begun to realize.\\n\\n\\nFor a month he tramped through the forest. It was October, a still\\ngolden, fulfilling season of the year; and everywhere in the vast dark\\ngreen a glorious blaze of oak and aspen made beautiful contrast. He\\ncarried his rifle, but he never used it. He would climb miles and go\\nthis way and that with no object in view. Yet his eye and ear had\\nnever been keener. Hours he would spend on a promontory, watching\\nthe distance, where the golden patches of aspen shone bright out\\nof dark green mountain slopes. He loved to fling himself down in an\\naspen grove at the edge of a senaca, and there lie in that radiance like\\na veil of gold and purple and red, with the white tree trunks striping\\nthe shade. Always, whether there were breeze or not, the aspen leaves\\nquivered, ceaselessly, wonderfully, like his pulses, beyond his control.\\nOften he reclined against a mossy rock beside a mountain stream to\\nlisten, to watch, to feel all that was there, while his mind held a\\nhaunting, dark eyed vision of a girl. On the lonely heights, like an\\neagle, he sat gazing down into Paradise Park, that was more and more\\nbeautiful, but would never again be the same, never fill him with\\ncontent, never be all and all to him.\\n\\nLate in October the first snow fell. It melted at once on the south side\\nof the park, but the north slopes and the rims and domes above stayed\\nwhite.\\n\\nDale had worked quick and hard at curing and storing his winter supply\\nof food, and now he spent days chopping and splitting wood to burn\\nduring the months he would be snowed in. He watched for the dark gray,\\nfast scudding storm clouds, and welcomed them when they came. Once there\\nlay ten feet of snow on the trails he would be snowed in until spring.\\nIt would be impossible to go down to Pine. And perhaps during the long\\nwinter he would be cured of this strange, nameless disorder of his\\nfeelings.\\n\\nNovember brought storms up on the peaks. Flurries of snow fell in\\nthe park every day, but the sunny south side, where Dale's camp lay,\\nretained its autumnal color and warmth. Not till late in winter did the\\nsnow creep over this secluded nook.\\n\\nThe morning came at last, piercingly keen and bright, when Dale saw\\nthat the heights were impassable; the realization brought him a poignant\\nregret. He had not guessed how he had wanted to see Helen Rayner again\\nuntil it was too late. That opened his eyes. A raging frenzy of action\\nfollowed, in which he only tired himself physically without helping\\nhimself spiritually.\\n\\nIt was sunset when he faced the west, looking up at the pink snow domes\\nand the dark golden fringe of spruce, and in that moment he found the\\ntruth.\\n\\n“I love that girl! I love that girl!” he spoke aloud, to the distant\\nwhite peaks, to the winds, to the loneliness and silence of his prison,\\nto the great pines and to the murmuring stream, and to his faithful\\npets. It was his tragic confession of weakness, of amazing truth, of\\nhopeless position, of pitiful excuse for the transformation wrought in\\nhim.\\n\\nDale's struggle ended there when he faced his soul. To understand\\nhimself was to be released from strain, worry, ceaseless importuning\\ndoubt and wonder and fear. But the fever of unrest, of uncertainty, had\\nbeen nothing compared to a sudden upflashing torment of love.\\n\\nWith somber deliberation he set about the tasks needful, and others\\nthat he might make  his camp fires and meals, the care of his pets and\\nhorses, the mending of saddles and pack harness, the curing of buckskin\\nfor moccasins and hunting suits. So his days were not idle. But all this\\nwork was habit for him and needed no application of mind.\\n\\nAnd Dale, like some men of lonely wilderness lives who did not\\nretrograde toward the savage, was a thinker. Love made him a sufferer.\\n\\nThe surprise and shame of his unconscious surrender, the certain\\nhopelessness of it, the long years of communion with all that was wild,\\nlonely, and beautiful, the wonderfully developed insight into nature's\\nsecrets, and the sudden dawning revelation that he was no omniscient\\nbeing exempt from the ruthless ordinary destiny of man  all these showed\\nhim the strength of his manhood and of his passion, and that the life\\nhe had chosen was of all lives the one calculated to make love sad and\\nterrible.\\n\\nHelen Rayner haunted him. In the sunlight there was not a place\\naround camp which did not picture her lithe, vigorous body, her dark,\\nthoughtful eyes, her eloquent, resolute lips, and the smile that was so\\nsweet and strong. At night she was there like a slender specter, pacing\\nbeside him under the moaning pines. Every camp fire held in its heart\\nthe glowing white radiance of her spirit.\\n\\nNature had taught Dale to love solitude and silence, but love itself\\ntaught him their meaning. Solitude had been created for the eagle on his\\ncrag, for the blasted mountain fir, lonely and gnarled on its peak, for\\nthe elk and the wolf. But it had not been intended for man. And to\\nlive always in the silence of wild places was to become obsessed with\\nself  to think and dream  to be happy, which state, however pursued by\\nman, was not good for him. Man must be given imperious longings for the\\nunattainable.\\n\\nIt needed, then, only the memory of an unattainable woman to render\\nsolitude passionately desired by a man, yet almost unendurable. Dale was\\nalone with his secret; and every pine, everything in that park saw him\\nshaken and undone.\\n\\nIn the dark, pitchy deadness of night, when there was no wind and the\\ncold on the peaks had frozen the waterfall, then the silence seemed\\ninsupportable. Many hours that should have been given to slumber were\\npaced out under the cold, white, pitiless stars, under the lonely pines.\\n\\nDale's memory betrayed him, mocked his restraint, cheated him of\\nany peace; and his imagination, sharpened by love, created pictures,\\nfancies, feelings, that drove him frantic.\\n\\nHe thought of Helen Rayner's strong, shapely brown hand. In a thousand\\ndifferent actions it haunted him. How quick and deft in camp fire tasks!\\nhow graceful and swift as she plaited her dark hair! how tender and\\nskilful in its ministration when one of his pets had been injured! how\\neloquent when pressed tight against her breast in a moment of fear on\\nthe dangerous heights! how expressive of unutterable things when laid on\\nhis arm!\\n\\nDale saw that beautiful hand slowly creep up his arm, across his\\nshoulder, and slide round his neck to clasp there. He was powerless to\\ninhibit the picture. And what he felt then was boundless, unutterable.\\nNo woman had ever yet so much as clasped his hand, and heretofore no\\nsuch imaginings had ever crossed his mind, yet deep in him, somewhere\\nhidden, had been this waiting, sweet, and imperious need. In the bright\\nday he appeared to ward off such fancies, but at night he was helpless.\\nAnd every fancy left him weaker, wilder.\\n\\nWhen, at the culmination of this phase of his passion, Dale, who\\nhad never known the touch of a woman's lips, suddenly yielded to the\\nillusion of Helen Rayner's kisses, he found himself quite mad, filled\\nwith rapture and despair, loving her as he hated himself. It seemed as\\nif he had experienced all these terrible feelings in some former life\\nand had forgotten them in this life. He had no right to think of her,\\nbut he could not resist it. Imagining the sweet surrender of her lips\\nwas a sacrilege, yet here, in spite of will and honor and shame, he was\\nlost.\\n\\nDale, at length, was vanquished, and he ceased to rail at himself, or\\nrestrain his fancies. He became a dreamy, sad eyed, camp fire gazer,\\nlike many another lonely man, separated, by chance or error, from what\\nthe heart hungered most for. But this great experience, when all its\\nsignificance had clarified in his mind, immeasurably broadened his\\nunderstanding of the principles of nature applied to life.\\n\\nLove had been in him stronger than in most men, because of his keen,\\nvigorous, lonely years in the forest, where health of mind and body were\\nintensified and preserved. How simple, how natural, how inevitable! He\\nmight have loved any fine spirited, healthy bodied girl. Like a tree\\nshooting its branches and leaves, its whole entity, toward the sunlight,\\nso had he grown toward a woman's love. Why? Because the thing he revered\\nin nature, the spirit, the universal, the life that was God, had created\\nat his birth or before his birth the three tremendous instincts of\\nnature  to fight for life, to feed himself, to reproduce his kind. That\\nwas all there was to it. But oh! the mystery, the beauty, the torment,\\nand the terror of this third instinct  this hunger for the sweetness and\\nthe glory of a woman's love!\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nHelen Rayner dropped her knitting into her lap and sat pensively gazing\\nout of the window over the bare yellow ranges of her uncle's ranch.\\n\\nThe winter day was bright, but steely, and the wind that whipped down\\nfrom the white capped mountains had a keen, frosty edge. A scant snow\\nlay in protected places; cattle stood bunched in the lee of ridges; low\\nsheets of dust scurried across the flats.\\n\\nThe big living room of the ranch house was warm and comfortable with its\\nred adobe walls, its huge stone fireplace where cedar logs blazed, and\\nits many colored blankets. Bo Rayner sat before the fire, curled up in\\nan armchair, absorbed in a book. On the floor lay the hound Pedro, his\\nracy, fine head stretched toward the warmth.\\n\\n“Did uncle call?” asked Helen, with a start out of her reverie.\\n\\n“I didn't hear him,” replied Bo.\\n\\nHelen rose to tiptoe across the floor, and, softly parting some\\ncurtains, she looked into the room where her uncle lay. He was asleep.\\nSometimes he called out in his slumbers. For weeks now he had been\\nconfined to his bed, slowly growing weaker. With a sigh Helen returned\\nto her window seat and took up her work.\\n\\n“Bo, the sun is bright,” she said. “The days are growing longer. I'm so\\nglad.”\\n\\n“Nell, you're always wishing time away. For me it passes quickly\\nenough,” replied the sister.\\n\\n“But I love spring and summer and fall  and I guess I hate winter,”\\n returned Helen, thoughtfully.\\n\\nThe yellow ranges rolled away up to the black ridges and they in turn\\nswept up to the cold, white mountains. Helen's gaze seemed to go beyond\\nthat snowy barrier. And Bo's keen eyes studied her sister's earnest, sad\\nface.\\n\\n“Nell, do you ever think of Dale?” she queried, suddenly.\\n\\nThe question startled Helen. A slow blush suffused neck and cheek.\\n\\n“Of course,” she replied, as if surprised that Bo should ask such a\\nthing.\\n\\n“I  I shouldn't have asked that,” said Bo, softly, and then bent again\\nover her book.\\n\\nHelen gazed tenderly at that bright, bowed head. In this swift flying,\\neventful, busy winter, during which the management of the ranch had\\ndevolved wholly upon Helen, the little sister had grown away from her.\\nBo had insisted upon her own free will and she had followed it, to\\nthe amusement of her uncle, to the concern of Helen, to the dismay and\\nbewilderment of the faithful Mexican housekeeper, and to the undoing of\\nall the young men on the ranch.\\n\\nHelen had always been hoping and waiting for a favorable hour in which\\nshe might find this wilful sister once more susceptible to wise and\\nloving influence. But while she hesitated to speak, slow footsteps and a\\njingle of spurs sounded without, and then came a timid knock. Bo looked\\nup brightly and ran to open the door.\\n\\n“Oh! It's only  YOU!” she uttered, in withering scorn, to the one who\\nknocked.\\n\\nHelen thought she could guess who that was.\\n\\n“How are you all?” asked a drawling voice.\\n\\n“Well, Mister Carmichael, if that interests you  I'm quite ill,” replied\\nBo, freezingly.\\n\\n“Ill! Aw no, now?”\\n\\n“It's a fact. If I don't die right off I'll have to be taken back to\\nMissouri,” said Bo, casually.\\n\\n“Are you goin' to ask me in?” queried Carmichael, bluntly. “It's\\ncold  an' I've got somethin' to say to  ”\\n\\n“To ME? Well, you're not backward, I declare,” retorted Bo.\\n\\n“Miss Rayner, I reckon it 'll be strange to you  findin' out I didn't\\ncome to see you.”\\n\\n“Indeed! No. But what was strange was the deluded idea I had  that you\\nmeant to apologize to me  like a gentleman... Come in, Mr. Carmichael.\\nMy sister is here.”\\n\\nThe door closed as Helen turned round. Carmichael stood just inside with\\nhis sombrero in hand, and as he gazed at Bo his lean face seemed hard.\\nIn the few months since autumn he had changed  aged, it seemed, and the\\nonce young, frank, alert, and careless cowboy traits had merged into the\\nmaking of a man. Helen knew just how much of a man he really was. He had\\nbeen her mainstay during all the complex working of the ranch that had\\nfallen upon her shoulders.\\n\\n“Wal, I reckon you was deluded, all right  if you thought I'd crawl like\\nthem other lovers of yours,” he said, with cool deliberation.\\n\\nBo turned pale, and her eyes fairly blazed, yet even in what must have\\nbeen her fury Helen saw amaze and pain.\\n\\n“OTHER lovers? I think the biggest delusion here is the way you flatter\\nyourself,” replied Bo, stingingly.\\n\\n“Me flatter myself? Nope. You don't savvy me. I'm shore hatin' myself\\nthese days.”\\n\\n“Small wonder. I certainly hate you  with all my heart!”\\n\\nAt this retort the cowboy dropped his head and did not see Bo flaunt\\nherself out of the room. But he heard the door close, and then slowly\\ncame toward Helen.\\n\\n“Cheer up, Las Vegas,” said Helen, smiling. “Bo's hot tempered.”\\n\\n“Miss Nell, I'm just like a dog. The meaner she treats me the more I\\nlove her,” he replied, dejectedly.\\n\\nTo Helen's first instinct of liking for this cowboy there had been added\\nadmiration, respect, and a growing appreciation of strong, faithful,\\ndeveloping character. Carmichael's face and hands were red and chapped\\nfrom winter winds; the leather of wrist bands, belt, and boots was all\\nworn shiny and thin; little streaks of dust fell from him as he breathed\\nheavily. He no longer looked the dashing cowboy, ready for a dance or\\nlark or fight.\\n\\n“How in the world did you offend her so?” asked Helen. “Bo is furious. I\\nnever saw her so angry as that.”\\n\\n“Miss Nell, it was jest this way,” began Carmichael. “Shore Bo's knowed\\nI was in love with her. I asked her to marry me an' she wouldn't say\\nyes or no... An', mean as it sounds  she never run away from it, thet's\\nshore. We've had some quarrels  two of them bad, an' this last's the\\nworst.”\\n\\n“Bo told me about one quarrel,” said Helen. “It was  because you\\ndrank  that time.”\\n\\n“Shore it was. She took one of her cold spells an' I jest got drunk.”\\n\\n“But that was wrong,” protested Helen.\\n\\n“I ain't so shore. You see, I used to get drunk often  before I come\\nhere. An' I've been drunk only once. Back at Las Vegas the outfit would\\nnever believe thet. Wal, I promised Bo I wouldn't do it again, an' I've\\nkept my word.”\\n\\n“That is fine of you. But tell me, why is she angry now?”\\n\\n“Bo makes up to all the fellars,” confessed Carmichael, hanging his\\nhead. “I took her to the dance last week  over in the town hall. Thet's\\nthe first time she'd gone anywhere with me. I shore was proud... But\\nthet dance was hell. Bo carried on somethin' turrible, an' I  ”\\n\\n“Tell me. What did she do?” demanded Helen, anxiously. “I'm responsible\\nfor her. I've got to see that she behaves.”\\n\\n“Aw, I ain't sayin' she didn't behave like a lady,” replied Carmichael.\\n“It was  she  wal, all them fellars are fools over her  an' Bo wasn't\\ntrue to me.”\\n\\n“My dear boy, is Bo engaged to you?”\\n\\n“Lord  if she only was!” he sighed.\\n\\n“Then how can you say she wasn't true to you? Be reasonable.”\\n\\n“I reckon now, Miss Nell, thet no one can be in love an' act\\nreasonable,” rejoined the cowboy. “I don't know how to explain, but the\\nfact is I feel thet Bo has played the  the devil with me an' all the\\nother fellars.”\\n\\n“You mean she has flirted?”\\n\\n“I reckon.”\\n\\n“Las Vegas, I'm afraid you're right,” said Helen, with growing\\napprehension. “Go on. Tell me what's happened.”\\n\\n“Wal, thet Turner boy, who rides for Beasley, he was hot after Bo,”\\n returned Carmichael, and he spoke as if memory hurt him. “Reckon I've\\nno use for Turner. He's a fine lookin', strappin', big cow puncher, an'\\ncalculated to win the girls. He brags thet he can, an' I reckon he's\\nright. Wal, he was always hangin' round Bo. An' he stole one of my\\ndances with Bo. I only had three, an' he comes up to say this one was\\nhis; Bo, very innocent  oh, she's a cute one!  she says, 'Why, Mister\\nTurner  is it really yours?' An' she looked so full of joy thet when he\\nsays to me, 'Excoose us, friend Carmichael,' I sat there like a locoed\\njackass an' let them go. But I wasn't mad at thet. He was a better\\ndancer than me an' I wanted her to have a good time. What started the\\nhell was I seen him put his arm round her when it wasn't just time,\\naccordin' to the dance, an' Bo  she didn't break any records gettin'\\naway from him. She pushed him away  after a little  after I near died.\\nWal, on the way home I had to tell her. I shore did. An' she said what\\nI'd love to forget. Then  then, Miss Nell, I grabbed her  it was outside\\nhere by the porch an' all bright moonlight  I grabbed her an' hugged an'\\nkissed her good. When I let her go I says, sorta brave, but I was plumb\\nscared  I says, 'Wal, are you goin' to marry me now?'”\\n\\nHe concluded with a gulp, and looked at Helen with woe in his eyes.\\n\\n“Oh! What did Bo do?” breathlessly queried Helen.\\n\\n“She slapped me,” he replied. “An' then she says, I did like you best,\\nbut NOW I hate you!' An' she slammed the door in my face.”\\n\\n“I think you made a great mistake,” said Helen, gravely.\\n\\n“Wal, if I thought so I'd beg her forgiveness. But I reckon I don't.\\nWhat's more, I feel better than before. I'm only a cowboy an' never was\\nmuch good till I met her. Then I braced. I got to havin' hopes, studyin'\\nbooks, an' you know how I've been lookin' into this ranchin' game. I\\nstopped drinkin' an' saved my money. Wal, she knows all thet. Once she\\nsaid she was proud of me. But it didn't seem to count big with her.\\nAn' if it can't count big I don't want it to count at all. I reckon the\\nmadder Bo is at me the more chance I've got. She knows I love her  thet\\nI'd die for her  thet I'm a changed man. An' she knows I never before\\nthought of darin' to touch her hand. An' she knows she flirted with\\nTurner.”\\n\\n“She's only a child,” replied Helen. “And all this change  the West  the\\nwildness  and you boys making much of her  why, it's turned her head.\\nBut Bo will come out of it true blue. She is good, loving. Her heart is\\ngold.”\\n\\n“I reckon I know, an' my faith can't be shook,” rejoined Carmichael,\\nsimply. “But she ought to believe thet she'll make bad blood out\\nhere. The West is the West. Any kind of girls are scarce. An' one like\\nBo  Lord! we cowboys never seen none to compare with her. She'll make\\nbad blood an' some of it will be spilled.”\\n\\n“Uncle Al encourages her,” said Helen, apprehensively. “It tickles him\\nto hear how the boys are after her. Oh, she doesn't tell him. But he\\nhears. And I, who must stand in mother's place to her, what can I do?”\\n\\n“Miss Nell, are you on my side?” asked the cowboy, wistfully. He was\\nstrong and elemental, caught in the toils of some power beyond him.\\n\\nYesterday Helen might have hesitated at that question. But to day\\nCarmichael brought some proven quality of loyalty, some strange depth of\\nrugged sincerity, as if she had learned his future worth.\\n\\n“Yes, I am,” Helen replied, earnestly. And she offered her hand.\\n\\n“Wal, then it 'll shore turn out happy,” he said, squeezing her hand.\\nHis smile was grateful, but there was nothing in it of the victory he\\nhinted at. Some of his ruddy color had gone. “An' now I want to tell you\\nwhy I come.”\\n\\nHe had lowered his voice. “Is Al asleep?” he whispered.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Helen. “He was a little while ago.”\\n\\n“Reckon I'd better shut his door.”\\n\\nHelen watched the cowboy glide across the room and carefully close the\\ndoor, then return to her with intent eyes. She sensed events in his\\nlook, and she divined suddenly that he must feel as if he were her\\nbrother.\\n\\n“Shore I'm the one thet fetches all the bad news to you,” he said,\\nregretfully.\\n\\nHelen caught her breath. There had indeed been many little calamities\\nto mar her management of the ranch  loss of cattle, horses, sheep  the\\ndesertion of herders to Beasley  failure of freighters to arrive\\nwhen most needed  fights among the cowboys  and disagreements over\\nlong arranged deals.\\n\\n“Your uncle Al makes a heap of this here Jeff Mulvey,” asserted\\nCarmichael.\\n\\n“Yes, indeed. Uncle absolutely relies on Jeff,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“Wal, I hate to tell you, Miss Nell,” said the cowboy, bitterly, “thet\\nMulvey ain't the man he seems.”\\n\\n“Oh, what do you mean?”\\n\\n“When your uncle dies Mulvey is goin' over to Beasley an' he's goin' to\\ntake all the fellars who'll stick to him.”\\n\\n“Could Jeff be so faithless  after so many years my uncle's foreman? Oh,\\nhow do you know?”\\n\\n“Reckon I guessed long ago. But wasn't shore. Miss Nell, there's a\\nlot in the wind lately, as poor old Al grows weaker. Mulvey has been\\nparticular friendly to me an' I've nursed him along, 'cept I wouldn't\\ndrink. An' his pards have been particular friends with me, too, more\\nan' more as I loosened up. You see, they was shy of me when I first got\\nhere. To day the whole deal showed clear to me like a hoof track in soft\\nground. Bud Lewis, who's bunked with me, come out an' tried to win me\\nover to Beasley  soon as Auchincloss dies. I palavered with Bud an' I\\nwanted to know. But Bud would only say he was goin' along with Jeff an'\\nothers of the outfit. I told him I'd reckon over it an' let him know. He\\nthinks I'll come round.”\\n\\n“Why  why will these men leave me when  when  Oh, poor uncle! They\\nbargain on his death. But why  tell me why?”\\n\\n“Beasley has worked on them  won them over,” replied Carmichael, grimly.\\n“After Al dies the ranch will go to you. Beasley means to have it. He\\nan' Al was pards once, an' now Beasley has most folks here believin' he\\ngot the short end of thet deal. He'll have papers  shore  an' he'll have\\nmost of the men. So he'll just put you off an' take possession. Thet's\\nall, Miss Nell, an' you can rely on its bein' true.”\\n\\n“I  I believe you  but I can't believe such  such robbery possible,”\\n gasped Helen.\\n\\n“It's simple as two an' two. Possession is law out here. Once Beasley\\ngets on the ground it's settled. What could you do with no men to fight\\nfor your property?”\\n\\n“But, surely, some of the men will stay with me?”\\n\\n“I reckon. But not enough.”\\n\\n“Then I can hire more. The Beeman boys. And Dale would come to help me.”\\n\\n“Dale would come. An' he'd help a heap. I wish he was here,” replied\\nCarmichael, soberly. “But there's no way to get him. He's snowed up till\\nMay.”\\n\\n“I dare not confide in uncle,” said Helen, with agitation. “The shock\\nmight kill him. Then to tell him of the unfaithfulness of his old\\nmen  that would be cruel... Oh, it can't be so bad as you think.”\\n\\n“I reckon it couldn't be no worse. An'  Miss Nell, there's only one way\\nto get out of it  an' thet's the way of the West.”\\n\\n“How?” queried Helen, eagerly.\\n\\nCarmichael lunged himself erect and stood gazing down at her. He seemed\\ncompletely detached now from that frank, amiable cowboy of her first\\nimpressions. The redness was totally gone from his face. Something\\nstrange and cold and sure looked out of his eyes.\\n\\n“I seen Beasley go in the saloon as I rode past. Suppose I go down\\nthere, pick a quarrel with him  an' kill him?”\\n\\nHelen sat bolt upright with a cold shock.\\n\\n“Carmichael! you're not serious?” she exclaimed.\\n\\n“Serious? I shore am. Thet's the only way, Miss Nell. An' I reckon it's\\nwhat Al would want. An' between you an' me  it would be easier than\\nropin' a calf. These fellars round Pine don't savvy guns. Now, I come\\nfrom where guns mean somethin'. An' when I tell you I can throw a gun\\nslick an' fast, why I shore ain't braggin'. You needn't worry none about\\nme, Miss Nell.”\\n\\nHelen grasped that he had taken the signs of her shocked sensibility\\nto mean she feared for his life. But what had sickened her was the mere\\nidea of bloodshed in her behalf.\\n\\n“You'd  kill Beasley  just because there are rumors of his  treachery?”\\n gasped Helen.\\n\\n“Shore. It'll have to be done, anyhow,” replied the cowboy.\\n\\n“No! No! It's too dreadful to think of. Why, that would be murder. I  I\\ncan't understand how you speak of it  so  so calmly.”\\n\\n“Reckon I ain't doin' it calmly. I'm as mad as hell,” said Carmichael,\\nwith a reckless smile.\\n\\n“Oh, if you are serious then, I say no  no  no! I forbid you. I don't\\nbelieve I'll be robbed of my property.”\\n\\n“Wal, supposin' Beasley does put you off  an' takes possession. What 're\\nyou goin' to say then?” demanded the cowboy, in slow, cool deliberation.\\n\\n“I'd say the same then as now,” she replied.\\n\\nHe bent his head thoughtfully while his red hands smoothed his sombrero.\\n\\n“Shore you girls haven't been West very long,” he muttered, as if\\napologizing for them. “An' I reckon it takes time to learn the ways of a\\ncountry.”\\n\\n“West or no West, I won't have fights deliberately picked, and men shot,\\neven if they do threaten me,” declared Helen, positively.\\n\\n“All right, Miss Nell, shore I respect your wishes,” he returned. “But\\nI'll tell you this. If Beasley turns you an' Bo out of your home  wal,\\nI'll look him up on my own account.”\\n\\nHelen could only gaze at him as he backed to the door, and she thrilled\\nand shuddered at what seemed his loyalty to her, his love for Bo, and\\nthat which was inevitable in himself.\\n\\n“Reckon you might save us all some trouble  now if you'd  just get\\nmad  an' let me go after thet greaser.”\\n\\n“Greaser! Do you mean Beasley?”\\n\\n“Shore. He's a half breed. He was born in Magdalena, where I heard folks\\nsay nary one of his parents was no good.”\\n\\n“That doesn't matter. I'm thinking of humanity of law and order. Of what\\nis right.”\\n\\n“Wal, Miss Nell, I'll wait till you get real mad  or till Beasley  ”\\n\\n“But, my friend, I'll not get mad,” interrupted Helen. “I'll keep my\\ntemper.”\\n\\n“I'll bet you don't,” he retorted. “Mebbe you think you've none of Bo in\\nyou. But I'll bet you could get so mad  once you started  thet you'd\\nbe turrible. What 've you got them eyes for, Miss Nell, if you ain't an\\nAuchincloss?”\\n\\nHe was smiling, yet he meant every word. Helen felt the truth as\\nsomething she feared.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, I won't bet. But you  you will always come to me  first  if\\nthere's trouble.”\\n\\n“I promise,” he replied, soberly, and then went out.\\n\\nHelen found that she was trembling, and that there was a commotion in\\nher breast. Carmichael had frightened her. No longer did she hold doubt\\nof the gravity of the situation. She had seen Beasley often, several\\ntimes close at hand, and once she had been forced to meet him. That time\\nhad convinced her that he had evinced personal interest in her. And on\\nthis account, coupled with the fact that Riggs appeared to have nothing\\nelse to do but shadow her, she had been slow in developing her intention\\nof organizing and teaching a school for the children of Pine. Riggs had\\nbecome rather a doubtful celebrity in the settlements. Yet his bold,\\napparent badness had made its impression. From all reports he spent his\\ntime gambling, drinking, and bragging. It was no longer news in Pine\\nwhat his intentions were toward Helen Rayner. Twice he had ridden up to\\nthe ranch house, upon one occasion securing an interview with Helen. In\\nspite of her contempt and indifference, he was actually influencing her\\nlife there in Pine. And it began to appear that the other man, Beasley,\\nmight soon direct stronger significance upon the liberty of her actions.\\n\\nThe responsibility of the ranch had turned out to be a heavy burden. It\\ncould not be managed, at least by her, in the way Auchincloss wanted\\nit done. He was old, irritable, irrational, and hard. Almost all the\\nneighbors were set against him, and naturally did not take kindly to\\nHelen.\\n\\nShe had not found the slightest evidence of unfair dealing on the part\\nof her uncle, but he had been a hard driver. Then his shrewd, far seeing\\njudgment had made all his deals fortunate for him, which fact had not\\nbrought a profit of friendship.\\n\\nOf late, since Auchincloss had grown weaker and less dominating, Helen\\nhad taken many decisions upon herself, with gratifying and hopeful\\nresults. But the wonderful happiness that she had expected to find in\\nthe West still held aloof. The memory of Paradise Park seemed only a\\ndream, sweeter and more intangible as time passed, and fuller of vague\\nregrets. Bo was a comfort, but also a very considerable source of\\nanxiety. She might have been a help to Helen if she had not assimilated\\nWestern ways so swiftly. Helen wished to decide things in her own way,\\nwhich was as yet quite far from Western. So Helen had been thrown more\\nand more upon her own resources, with the cowboy Carmichael the only one\\nwho had come forward voluntarily to her aid.\\n\\nFor an hour Helen sat alone in the room, looking out of the window, and\\nfacing stern reality with a colder, graver, keener sense of intimacy\\nthan ever before. To hold her property and to live her life in this\\ncommunity according to her ideas of honesty, justice, and law might well\\nbe beyond her powers. To day she had been convinced that she could not\\ndo so without fighting for them, and to fight she must have friends.\\nThat conviction warmed her toward Carmichael, and a thoughtful\\nconsideration of all he had done for her proved that she had not fully\\nappreciated him. She would make up for her oversight.\\n\\nThere were no Mormons in her employ, for the good reason that\\nAuchincloss would not hire them. But in one of his kindlier hours,\\ngrowing rare now, he had admitted that the Mormons were the best and the\\nmost sober, faithful workers on the ranges, and that his sole objection\\nto them was just this fact of their superiority. Helen decided to hire\\nthe four Beemans and any of their relatives or friends who would come;\\nand to do this, if possible, without letting her uncle know. His temper\\nnow, as well as his judgment, was a hindrance to efficiency. This\\ndecision regarding the Beemans; brought Helen back to Carmichael's\\nfervent wish for Dale, and then to her own.\\n\\nSoon spring would be at hand, with its multiplicity of range tasks. Dale\\nhad promised to come to Pine then, and Helen knew that promise would be\\nkept. Her heart beat a little faster, in spite of her business centered\\nthoughts. Dale was there, over the black sloped, snowy tipped mountain,\\nshut away from the world. Helen almost envied him. No wonder he loved\\nloneliness, solitude, the sweet, wild silence and beauty of Paradise\\nPark! But he was selfish, and Helen meant to show him that. She needed\\nhis help. When she recalled his physical prowess with animals, and\\nimagined what it must be in relation to men, she actually smiled at the\\nthought of Beasley forcing her off her property, if Dale were there.\\nBeasley would only force disaster upon himself. Then Helen experienced\\na quick shock. Would Dale answer to this situation as Carmichael had\\nanswered? It afforded her relief to assure herself to the contrary.\\nThe cowboy was one of a blood letting breed; the hunter was a man of\\nthought, gentleness, humanity. This situation was one of the kind that\\nhad made him despise the littleness of men. Helen assured herself\\nthat he was different from her uncle and from the cowboy, in all the\\nrelations of life which she had observed while with him. But a doubt\\nlingered in her mind. She remembered his calm reference to Snake Anson,\\nand that caused a recurrence of the little shiver Carmichael had given\\nher. When the doubt augmented to a possibility that she might not be\\nable to control Dale, then she tried not to think of it any more. It\\nconfused and perplexed her that into her mind should flash a thought\\nthat, though it would be dreadful for Carmichael to kill Beasley, for\\nDale to do it would be a calamity  a terrible thing. Helen did not\\nanalyze that strange thought. She was as afraid of it as she was of the\\nstir in her blood when she visualized Dale.\\n\\nHer meditation was interrupted by Bo, who entered the room,\\nrebellious eyed and very lofty. Her manner changed, which apparently\\nowed its cause to the fact that Helen was alone.\\n\\n“Is that  cowboy gone?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes. He left quite some time ago,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“I wondered if he made your eyes shine  your color burn so. Nell, you're\\njust beautiful.”\\n\\n“Is my face burning?” asked Helen, with a little laugh. “So it is.\\nWell, Bo, you've no cause for jealousy. Las Vegas can't be blamed for my\\nblushes.”\\n\\n“Jealous! Me? Of that wild eyed, soft voiced, two faced cow puncher? I\\nguess not, Nell Rayner. What 'd he say about me?”\\n\\n“Bo, he said a lot,” replied Helen, reflectively. “I'll tell you\\npresently. First I want to ask you  has Carmichael ever told you how\\nhe's helped me?”\\n\\n“No! When I see him  which hasn't been often lately  he  I  Well, we\\nfight. Nell, has he helped you?”\\n\\nHelen smiled in faint amusement. She was going to be sincere, but she\\nmeant to keep her word to the cowboy. The fact was that reflection had\\nacquainted her with her indebtedness to Carmichael.\\n\\n“Bo, you've been so wild to ride half broken mustangs  and carry on with\\ncowboys  and read  and sew  and keep your secrets that you've had no\\ntime for your sister or her troubles.”\\n\\n“Nell!” burst out Bo, in amaze and pain. She flew to Helen and seized\\nher hands. “What 're you saying?”\\n\\n“It's all true,” replied Helen, thrilling and softening. This sweet\\nsister, once aroused, would be hard to resist. Helen imagined she should\\nhold to her tone of reproach and severity.\\n\\n“Sure it's true,” cried Bo, fiercely. “But what's my fooling got to do\\nwith the  the rest you said? Nell, are you keeping things from me?”\\n\\n“My dear, I never get any encouragement to tell you my troubles.”\\n\\n“But I've  I've nursed uncle  sat up with him  just the same as you,”\\n said Bo, with quivering lips.\\n\\n“Yes, you've been good to him.”\\n\\n“We've no other troubles, have we, Nell?”\\n\\n“You haven't, but I have,” responded Helen, reproachfully.\\n\\n“Why  why didn't you tell me?” cried Bo, passionately. “What are they?\\nTell me now. You must think me a  a selfish, hateful cat.”\\n\\n“Bo, I've had much to worry me  and the worst is yet to come,” replied\\nHelen. Then she told Bo how complicated and bewildering was the\\nmanagement of a big ranch  when the owner was ill, testy, defective in\\nmemory, and hard as steel  when he had hoards of gold and notes, but\\ncould not or would not remember his obligations  when the neighbor\\nranchers had just claims  when cowboys and sheep herders were\\ndiscontented, and wrangled among themselves  when great herds of cattle\\nand flocks of sheep had to be fed in winter  when supplies had to be\\ncontinually freighted across a muddy desert and lastly, when an enemy\\nrancher was slowly winning away the best hands with the end in view of\\ndeliberately taking over the property when the owner died. Then Helen\\ntold how she had only that day realized the extent of Carmichael's\\nadvice and help and labor  how, indeed, he had been a brother to\\nher  how  \\n\\nBut at this juncture Bo buried her face in Helen's breast and began to\\ncry wildly.\\n\\n“I  I  don't want  to hear  any more,” she sobbed.\\n\\n“Well, you've got to hear it,” replied Helen, inexorably “I want you to\\nknow how he's stood by me.”\\n\\n“But I hate him.”\\n\\n“Bo, I suspect that's not true.”\\n\\n“I do  I do.”\\n\\n“Well, you act and talk very strangely then.”\\n\\n“Nell Rayner  are  you  you sticking up for that  that devil?”\\n\\n“I am, yes, so far as it concerns my conscience,” rejoined Helen,\\nearnestly. “I never appreciated him as he deserved  not until now. He's\\na man, Bo, every inch of him. I've seen him grow up to that in three\\nmonths. I'd never have gotten along without him. I think he's fine,\\nmanly, big. I  ”\\n\\n“I'll bet  he's made love  to you, too,” replied Bo, woefully.\\n\\n“Talk sense,” said Helen, sharply. “He has been a brother to me. But,\\nBo Rayner, if he HAD made love to me I  I might have appreciated it more\\nthan you.”\\n\\nBo raised her face, flushed in part and also pale, with tear wet cheeks\\nand the telltale blaze in the blue eyes.\\n\\n“I've been wild about that fellow. But I hate him, too,” she said, with\\nflashing spirit. “And I want to go on hating him. So don't tell me any\\nmore.”\\n\\nWhereupon Helen briefly and graphically related how Carmichael had\\noffered to kill Beasley, as the only way to save her property, and how,\\nwhen she refused, that he threatened he would do it anyhow.\\n\\nBo fell over with a gasp and clung to Helen.\\n\\n“Oh  Nell! Oh, now I love him more than  ever,” she cried, in mingled\\nrage and despair.\\n\\nHelen clasped her closely and tried to comfort her as in the old days,\\nnot so very far back, when troubles were not so serious as now.\\n\\n“Of course you love him,” she concluded. “I guessed that long ago. And\\nI'm glad. But you've been wilful  foolish. You wouldn't surrender to it.\\nYou wanted your fling with the other boys. You're  Oh, Bo, I fear you\\nhave been a sad little flirt.”\\n\\n“I  I wasn't very bad till  till he got bossy. Why, Nell, he\\nacted  right off  just as if he OWNED me. But he didn't... And to show\\nhim  I  I really did flirt with that Turner fellow. Then he  he insulted\\nme... Oh, I hate him!”\\n\\n“Nonsense, Bo. You can't hate any one while you love him,” protested\\nHelen.\\n\\n“Much you know about that,” flashed Bo. “You just can! Look here. Did\\nyou ever see a cowboy rope and throw and tie up a mean horse?”\\n\\n“Yes, I have.”\\n\\n“Do you have any idea how strong a cowboy is  how his hands and arms are\\nlike iron?”\\n\\n“Yes, I'm sure I know that, too.”\\n\\n“And how savage he is?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And how he goes at anything he wants to do?”\\n\\n“I must admit cowboys are abrupt,” responded Helen, with a smile.\\n\\n“Well, Miss Rayner, did you ever  when you were standing quiet like a\\nlady  did you ever have a cowboy dive at you with a terrible lunge  grab\\nyou and hold you so you couldn't move or breathe or scream  hug you\\ntill all your bones cracked  and kiss you so fierce and so hard that you\\nwanted to kill him and die?”\\n\\nHelen had gradually drawn back from this blazing eyed, eloquent sister,\\nand when the end of that remarkable question came it was impossible to\\nreply.\\n\\n“There! I see you never had that done to you,” resumed Bo, with\\nsatisfaction. “So don't ever talk to me.”\\n\\n“I've heard his side of the story,” said Helen, constrainedly.\\n\\nWith a start Bo sat up straighter, as if better to defend herself.\\n\\n“Oh! So you have? And I suppose you'll take his part  even about\\nthat  that bearish trick.”\\n\\n“No. I think that rude and bold. But, Bo, I don't believe he meant to\\nbe either rude or bold. From what he confessed to me I gather that he\\nbelieved he'd lose you outright or win you outright by that violence. It\\nseems girls can't play at love out here in this wild West. He said there\\nwould be blood shed over you. I begin to realize what he meant. He's\\nnot sorry for what he did. Think how strange that is. For he has the\\ninstincts of a gentleman. He's kind, gentle, chivalrous. Evidently he\\nhad tried every way to win your favor except any familiar advance. He\\ndid that as a last resort. In my opinion his motives were to force you\\nto accept or refuse him, and in case you refused him he'd always have\\nthose forbidden stolen kisses to assuage his self respect  when he\\nthought of Turner or any one else daring to be familiar with you. Bo,\\nI see through Carmichael, even if I don't make him clear to you. You've\\ngot to be honest with yourself. Did that act of his win or lose you? In\\nother words, do you love him or not?”\\n\\nBo hid her face.\\n\\n“Oh, Nell! it made me see how I loved him  and that made me so  so sick\\nI hated him... But now  the hate is all gone.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nWhen spring came at last and the willows drooped green and fresh over\\nthe brook and the range rang with bray of burro and whistle of stallion,\\nold Al Auchincloss had been a month in his grave.\\n\\nTo Helen it seemed longer. The month had been crowded with work, events,\\nand growing, more hopeful duties, so that it contained a world\\nof living. The uncle had not been forgotten, but the innumerable\\nrestrictions to development and progress were no longer manifest.\\nBeasley had not presented himself or any claim upon Helen; and she,\\ngathering confidence day by day, began to believe all that purport of\\ntrouble had been exaggerated.\\n\\nIn this time she had come to love her work and all that pertained to it.\\nThe estate was large. She had no accurate knowledge of how many acres\\nshe owned, but it was more than two thousand. The fine, old, rambling\\nranch house, set like a fort on the last of the foot hills, corrals and\\nfields and barns and meadows, and the rolling green range beyond, and\\ninnumerable sheep, horses, cattle  all these belonged to Helen, to her\\never wondering realization and ever growing joy. Still, she was afraid\\nto let herself go and be perfectly happy. Always there was the fear that\\nhad been too deep and strong to forget so soon.\\n\\nThis bright, fresh morning, in March, Helen came out upon the porch to\\nrevel a little in the warmth of sunshine and the crisp, pine scented\\nwind that swept down from the mountains. There was never a morning that\\nshe did not gaze mountainward, trying to see, with a folly she realized,\\nif the snow had melted more perceptibly away on the bold white ridge.\\nFor all she could see it had not melted an inch, and she would\\nnot confess why she sighed. The desert had become green and fresh,\\nstretching away there far below her range, growing dark and purple in\\nthe distance with vague buttes rising. The air was full of sound  notes\\nof blackbirds and the baas of sheep, and blasts from the corrals, and\\nthe clatter of light hoofs on the court below.\\n\\nBo was riding in from the stables. Helen loved to watch her on one of\\nthose fiery little mustangs, but the sight was likewise given to rousing\\napprehensions. This morning Bo appeared particularly bent on frightening\\nHelen. Down the lane Carmichael appeared, waving his arms, and Helen\\nat once connected him with Bo's manifest desire to fly away from that\\nparticular place. Since that day, a month back, when Bo had confessed\\nher love for Carmichael, she and Helen had not spoken of it or of the\\ncowboy. The boy and girl were still at odds. But this did not worry\\nHelen. Bo had changed much for the better, especially in that she\\ndevoted herself to Helen and to her work. Helen knew that all would\\nturn out well in the end, and so she had been careful of her rather\\nprecarious position between these two young firebrands.\\n\\nBo reined in the mustang at the porch steps. She wore a buckskin\\nriding suit which she had made herself, and its soft gray with the\\ntouches of red beads was mightily becoming to her. Then she had grown\\nconsiderably during the winter and now looked too flashing and pretty to\\nresemble a boy, yet singularly healthy and strong and lithe. Red spots\\nshone in her cheeks and her eyes held that ever dangerous blaze.\\n\\n“Nell, did you give me away to that cowboy?” she demanded.\\n\\n“Give you away!” exclaimed Helen, blankly.\\n\\n“Yes. You know I told you  awhile back  that I was wildly in love with\\nhim. Did you give me away  tell on me?”\\n\\nShe might have been furious, but she certainly was not confused.\\n\\n“Why, Bo! How could you? No. I did not,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“Never gave him a hint?”\\n\\n“Not even a hint. You have my word for that. Why? What's happened?”\\n\\n“He makes me sick.”\\n\\nBo would not say any more, owing to the near approach of the cowboy.\\n\\n“Mawnin', Miss Nell,” he drawled. “I was just tellin' this here Miss\\nBo Peep Rayner  ”\\n\\n“Don't call me that!” broke in Bo, with fire in her voice.\\n\\n“Wal, I was just tellin' her thet she wasn't goin' off on any more of\\nthem long rides. Honest now, Miss Nell, it ain't safe, an'  ”\\n\\n“You're not my boss,” retorted Bo.\\n\\n“Indeed, sister, I agree with him. You won't obey me.”\\n\\n“Reckon some one's got to be your boss,” drawled Carmichael. “Shore I\\nain't hankerin' for the job. You could ride to Kingdom Come or off among\\nthe Apaches  or over here a ways”  at this he grinned knowingly  “or\\nanywheres, for all I cared. But I'm workin' for Miss Nell, an' she's\\nboss. An' if she says you're not to take them rides  you won't. Savvy\\nthat, miss?”\\n\\nIt was a treat for Helen to see Bo look at the cowboy.\\n\\n“Mis ter Carmichael, may I ask how you are going to prevent me from\\nriding where I like?”\\n\\n“Wal, if you're goin' worse locoed this way I'll keep you off'n a hoss\\nif I have to rope you an' tie you up. By golly, I will!”\\n\\nHis dry humor was gone and manifestly he meant what he said.\\n\\n“Wal,” she drawled it very softly and sweetly, but venomously,\\n“if  you  ever  touch  me again!”\\n\\nAt this he flushed, then made a quick, passionate gesture with his hand,\\nexpressive of heat and shame.\\n\\n“You an' me will never get along,” he said, with a dignity full of\\npathos. “I seen thet a month back when you changed sudden like to me.\\nBut nothin' I say to you has any reckonin' of mine. I'm talkin' for your\\nsister. It's for her sake. An' your own... I never told her an' I never\\ntold you thet I've seen Riggs sneakin' after you twice on them desert\\nrides. Wal, I tell you now.”\\n\\nThe intelligence apparently had not the slightest effect on Bo. But\\nHelen was astonished and alarmed.\\n\\n“Riggs! Oh, Bo, I've seen him myself  riding around. He does not mean\\nwell. You must be careful.”\\n\\n“If I ketch him again,” went on Carmichael, with his mouth lining hard,\\n“I'm goin' after him.”\\n\\nHe gave her a cool, intent, piercing look, then he dropped his head and\\nturned away, to stride back toward the corrals.\\n\\nHelen could make little of the manner in which her sister watched the\\ncowboy pass out of sight.\\n\\n“A month back  when I changed sudden like,” mused Bo. “I wonder what he\\nmeant by that... Nell, did I change  right after the talk you had with\\nme  about him?”\\n\\n“Indeed you did, Bo,” replied Helen. “But it was for the better. Only\\nhe can't see it. How proud and sensitive he is! You wouldn't guess it\\nat first. Bo, your reserve has wounded him more than your flirting. He\\nthinks it's indifference.”\\n\\n“Maybe that 'll be good for him,” declared Bo. “Does he expect me to\\nfall on his neck? He's that thick headed! Why, he's the locoed one, not\\nme.”\\n\\n“I'd like to ask you, Bo, if you've seen how he has changed?” queried\\nHelen, earnestly. “He's older. He's worried. Either his heart is\\nbreaking for you or else he fears trouble for us. I fear it's both. How\\nhe watches you! Bo, he knows all you do  where you go. That about Riggs\\nsickens me.”\\n\\n“If Riggs follows me and tries any of his four flush desperado games\\nhe'll have his hands full,” said Bo, grimly. “And that without my cowboy\\nprotector! But I just wish Riggs would do something. Then we'll see what\\nLas Vegas Tom Carmichael cares. Then we'll see!”\\n\\nBo bit out the last words passionately and jealously, then she lifted\\nher bridle to the spirited mustang.\\n\\n“Nell, don't you fear for me,” she said. “I can take care of myself.”\\n\\nHelen watched her ride away, all but willing to confess that there\\nmight be truth in what Bo said. Then Helen went about her work, which\\nconsisted of routine duties as well as an earnest study to familiarize\\nherself with continually new and complex conditions of ranch life. Every\\nday brought new problems. She made notes of all that she observed, and\\nall that was told her, which habit she had found, after a few weeks of\\ntrial, was going to be exceedingly valuable to her. She did not intend\\nalways to be dependent upon the knowledge of hired men, however faithful\\nsome of them might be.\\n\\nThis morning on her rounds she had expected developments of some kind,\\nowing to the presence of Roy Beeman and two of his brothers, who had\\narrived yesterday. And she was to discover that Jeff Mulvey, accompanied\\nby six of his co workers and associates, had deserted her without a word\\nor even sending for their pay. Carmichael had predicted this. Helen had\\nhalf doubted. It was a relief now to be confronted with facts, however\\ndisturbing. She had fortified herself to withstand a great deal more\\ntrouble than had happened. At the gateway of the main corral, a huge\\ninclosure fenced high with peeled logs, she met Roy Beeman, lasso in\\nhand, the same tall, lean, limping figure she remembered so well.\\nSight of him gave her an inexplicable thrill  a flashing memory of an\\nunforgettable night ride. Roy was to have charge of the horses on the\\nranch, of which there were several hundred, not counting many lost on\\nrange and mountain, or the unbranded colts.\\n\\nRoy took off his sombrero and greeted her. This Mormon had a courtesy\\nfor women that spoke well for him. Helen wished she had more employees\\nlike him.\\n\\n“It's jest as Las Vegas told us it 'd be,” he said, regretfully. “Mulvey\\nan' his pards lit out this mornin'. I'm sorry, Miss Helen. Reckon thet's\\nall because I come over.”\\n\\n“I heard the news,” replied Helen. “You needn't be sorry, Roy, for I'm\\nnot. I'm glad. I want to know whom I can trust.”\\n\\n“Las Vegas says we're shore in for it now.”\\n\\n“Roy, what do you think?”\\n\\n“I reckon so. Still, Las Vegas is powerful cross these days an' always\\nlookin' on the dark side. With us boys, now, it's sufficient unto the\\nday is the evil thereof. But, Miss Helen, if Beasley forces the deal\\nthere will be serious trouble. I've seen thet happen. Four or five years\\nago Beasley rode some greasers off their farms an' no one ever knowed if\\nhe had a just claim.”\\n\\n“Beasley has no claim on my property. My uncle solemnly swore that on\\nhis death bed. And I find nothing in his books or papers of those years\\nwhen he employed Beasley. In fact, Beasley was never uncle's partner.\\nThe truth is that my uncle took Beasley up when he was a poor, homeless\\nboy.”\\n\\n“So my old dad says,” replied Roy. “But what's right don't always\\nprevail in these parts.”\\n\\n“Roy, you're the keenest man I've met since I came West. Tell me what\\nyou think will happen.”\\n\\nBeeman appeared flattered, but he hesitated to reply. Helen had long\\nbeen aware of the reticence of these outdoor men.\\n\\n“I reckon you mean cause an' effect, as Milt Dale would say,” responded\\nRoy, thoughtfully.\\n\\n“Yes. If Beasley attempts to force me off my ranch what will happen?”\\n\\nRoy looked up and met her gaze. Helen remembered that singular\\nstillness, intentness of his face.\\n\\n“Wal, if Dale an' John get here in time I reckon we can bluff thet\\nBeasley outfit.”\\n\\n“You mean my friends  my men would confront Beasley  refuse his\\ndemands  and if necessary fight him off?”\\n\\n“I shore do,” replied Roy.\\n\\n“But suppose you're not all here? Beasley would be smart enough to\\nchoose an opportune time. Suppose he did put me off and take possession?\\nWhat then?”\\n\\n“Then it 'd only be a matter of how soon Dale or Carmichael  or I  got\\nto Beasley.”\\n\\n“Roy! I feared just that. It haunts me. Carmichael asked me to let him\\ngo pick a fight with Beasley. Asked me, just as he would ask me about\\nhis work! I was shocked. And now you say Dale  and you  ”\\n\\nHelen choked in her agitation.\\n\\n“Miss Helen, what else could you look for? Las Vegas is in love with\\nMiss Bo. Shore he told me so. An' Dale's in love with you!... Why, you\\ncouldn't stop them any more 'n you could stop the wind from blowin' down\\na pine, when it got ready... Now, it's some different with me. I'm a\\nMormon an' I'm married. But I'm Dale's pard, these many years. An'\\nI care a powerful sight for you an' Miss Bo. So I reckon I'd draw on\\nBeasley the first chance I got.”\\n\\nHelen strove for utterance, but it was denied her. Roy's simple\\nstatement of Dale's love had magnified her emotion by completely\\nchanging its direction. She forgot what she had felt wretched about. She\\ncould not look at Roy.\\n\\n“Miss Helen, don't feel bad,” he said, kindly. “Shore you're not to\\nblame. Your comin' West hasn't made any difference in Beasley's fate,\\nexcept mebbe to hurry it a little. My dad is old, an' when he talks\\nit's like history. He looks back on happenin's. Wal, it's the nature of\\nhappenin's that Beasley passes away before his prime. Them of his breed\\ndon't live old in the West... So I reckon you needn't feel bad or\\nworry. You've got friends.”\\n\\nHelen incoherently thanked him, and, forgetting her usual round of\\ncorrals and stables, she hurried back toward the house, deeply stirred,\\nthrobbing and dim eyed, with a feeling she could not control. Roy Beeman\\nhad made a statement that had upset her equilibrium. It seemed simple\\nand natural, yet momentous and staggering. To hear that Dale loved\\nher  to hear it spoken frankly, earnestly, by Dale's best friend, was\\nstrange, sweet, terrifying. But was it true? Her own consciousness had\\nadmitted it. Yet that was vastly different from a man's open statement.\\nNo longer was it a dear dream, a secret that seemed hers alone. How she\\nhad lived on that secret hidden deep in her breast!\\n\\nSomething burned the dimness from her eyes as she looked toward the\\nmountains and her sight became clear, telescopic with its intensity.\\nMagnificently the mountains loomed. Black inroads and patches on the\\nslopes showed where a few days back all bad been white. The snow was\\nmelting fast. Dale would soon be free to ride down to Pine. And that was\\nan event Helen prayed for, yet feared as she had never feared anything.\\n\\n\\nThe noonday dinner bell startled Helen from a reverie that was a\\npleasant aftermath of her unrestraint. How the hours had flown! This\\nmorning at least must be credited to indolence.\\n\\nBo was not in the dining room, nor in her own room, nor was she in\\nsight from window or door. This absence had occurred before, but not\\nparticularly to disturb Helen. In this instance, however, she grew\\nworried. Her nerves presaged strain. There was an overcharge of\\nsensibility in her feelings or a strange pressure in the very\\natmosphere. She ate dinner alone, looking her apprehension, which was\\nnot mitigated by the expressive fears of old Maria, the Mexican woman\\nwho served her.\\n\\nAfter dinner she sent word to Roy and Carmichael that they had better\\nride out to look for Bo. Then Helen applied herself resolutely to her\\nbooks until a rapid clatter of hoofs out in the court caused her to jump\\nup and hurry to the porch. Roy was riding in.\\n\\n“Did you find her?” queried Helen, hurriedly.\\n\\n“Wasn't no track or sign of her up the north range,” replied Roy, as he\\ndismounted and threw his bridle. “An' I was ridin' back to take up her\\ntracks from the corral an' trail her. But I seen Las Vegas comin' an' he\\nwaved his sombrero. He was comin' up from the south. There he is now.”\\n\\nCarmichael appeared swinging into the lane. He was mounted on Helen's\\nbig black Ranger, and he made the dust fly.\\n\\n“Wal, he's seen her, thet's shore,” vouchsafed Roy, with relief, as\\nCarmichael rode up.\\n\\n“Miss Nell, she's comin',” said the cowboy, as he reined in and\\nslid down with his graceful single motion. Then in a violent action,\\ncharacteristic of him, he slammed his sombrero down on the porch and\\nthrew up both arms. “I've a hunch it's come off!”\\n\\n“Oh, what?” exclaimed Helen.\\n\\n“Now, Las Vegas, talk sense,” expostulated Roy. “Miss Helen is shore\\nnervous to day. Has anythin' happened?”\\n\\n“I reckon, but I don't know what,” replied Carmichael, drawing a long\\nbreath. “Folks, I must be gettin' old. For I shore felt orful queer till\\nI seen Bo. She was ridin' down the ridge across the valley. Ridin' some\\nfast, too, an' she'll be here right off, if she doesn't stop in the\\nvillage.”\\n\\n“Wal, I hear her comin' now,” said Roy. “An'  if you asked me I'd say\\nshe WAS ridin' some fast.”\\n\\nHelen heard the light, swift, rhythmic beat of hoofs, and then out on\\nthe curve of the road that led down to Pine she saw Bo's mustang, white\\nwith lather, coming on a dead run.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, do you see any Apaches?” asked Roy, quizzingly.\\n\\nThe cowboy made no reply, but he strode out from the porch, directly\\nin front of the mustang. Bo was pulling hard on the bridle, and had him\\nslowing down, but not controlled. When he reached the house it could\\neasily be seen that Bo had pulled him to the limit of her strength,\\nwhich was not enough to halt him. Carmichael lunged for the bridle and,\\nseizing it, hauled him to a standstill.\\n\\nAt close sight of Bo Helen uttered a startled cry. Bo was white; her\\nsombrero was gone and her hair undone; there were blood and dirt on\\nher face, and her riding suit was torn and muddy. She had evidently\\nsustained a fall. Roy gazed at her in admiring consternation, but\\nCarmichael never looked at her at all. Apparently he was examining the\\nhorse. “Well, help me off  somebody,” cried Bo, peremptorily. Her voice\\nwas weak, but not her spirit.\\n\\nRoy sprang to help her off, and when she was down it developed that she\\nwas lame.\\n\\n“Oh, Bo! You've had a tumble,” exclaimed Helen, anxiously, and she ran\\nto assist Roy. They led her up the porch and to the door. There she\\nturned to look at Carmichael, who was still examining the spent mustang.\\n\\n“Tell him  to come in,” she whispered.\\n\\n“Hey, there, Las Vegas!” called Roy. “Rustle hyar, will you?”\\n\\nWhen Bo had been led into the sitting room and seated in a chair\\nCarmichael entered. His face was a study, as slowly he walked up to Bo.\\n\\n“Girl, you  ain't hurt?” he asked, huskily.\\n\\n“It's no fault of yours that I'm not crippled  or dead or worse,”\\n retorted Bo. “You said the south range was the only safe ride for me.\\nAnd there  I  it happened.”\\n\\nShe panted a little and her bosom heaved. One of her gauntlets was gone,\\nand the bare band, that was bruised and bloody, trembled as she held it\\nout.\\n\\n“Dear, tell us  are you badly hurt?” queried Helen, with hurried\\ngentleness.\\n\\n“Not much. I've had a spill,” replied Bo. “But oh! I'm mad  I'm\\nboiling!”\\n\\nShe looked as if she might have exaggerated her doubt of injuries, but\\ncertainly she had not overestimated her state of mind. Any blaze Helen\\nhad heretofore seen in those quick eyes was tame compared to this one.\\nIt actually leaped. Bo was more than pretty then. Manifestly Roy was\\nadmiring her looks, but Carmichael saw beyond her charm. And slowly he\\nwas growing pale.\\n\\n“I rode out the south range  as I was told,” began Bo, breathing hard\\nand trying to control her feelings. “That's the ride you usually take,\\nNell, and you bet  if you'd taken it to day  you'd not be here now...\\nAbout three miles out I climbed off the range up that cedar slope. I\\nalways keep to high ground. When I got up I saw two horsemen ride out\\nof some broken rocks off to the east. They rode as if to come between me\\nand home. I didn't like that. I circled south. About a mile farther on I\\nspied another horseman and he showed up directly in front of me and came\\nalong slow. That I liked still less. It might have been accident, but it\\nlooked to me as if those riders had some intent. All I could do was head\\noff to the southeast and ride. You bet I did ride. But I got into rough\\nground where I'd never been before. It was slow going. At last I made\\nthe cedars and here I cut loose, believing I could circle ahead of those\\nstrange riders and come round through Pine. I had it wrong.”\\n\\nHere she hesitated, perhaps for breath, for she had spoken rapidly, or\\nperhaps to get better hold on her subject. Not improbably the effect she\\nwas creating on her listeners began to be significant. Roy sat absorbed,\\nperfectly motionless, eyes keen as steel, his mouth open. Carmichael\\nwas gazing over Bo's head, out of the window, and it seemed that he\\nmust know the rest of her narrative. Helen knew that her own wide eyed\\nattention alone would have been all compelling inspiration to Bo Rayner.\\n\\n“Sure I had it wrong,” resumed Bo. “Pretty soon heard a horse behind. I\\nlooked back. I saw a big bay riding down on me. Oh, but he was running!\\nHe just tore through the cedars. ... I was scared half out of my senses.\\nBut I spurred and beat my mustang. Then began a race! Rough going  thick\\ncedars  washes and gullies I had to make him run  to keep my saddle  to\\npick my way. Oh h h! but it was glorious! To race for fun  that's\\none thing; to race for your life is another! My heart was in my\\nmouth  choking me. I couldn't have yelled. I was as cold as ice  dizzy\\nsometimes  blind others  then my stomach turned  and I couldn't get my\\nbreath. Yet the wild thrills I had!... But I stuck on and held my own\\nfor several miles  to the edge of the cedars. There the big horse gained\\non me. He came pounding closer  perhaps as close as a hundred yards  I\\ncould hear him plain enough. Then I had my spill. Oh, my mustang\\ntripped  threw me 'way over his head. I hit light, but slid far  and\\nthat's what scraped me so. I know my knee is raw... When I got to my\\nfeet the big horse dashed up, throwing gravel all over me  and his rider\\njumped off... Now who do you think he was?”\\n\\nHelen knew, but she did not voice her conviction. Carmichael knew\\npositively, yet he kept silent. Roy was smiling, as if the narrative\\ntold did not seem so alarming to him.\\n\\n“Wal, the fact of you bein' here, safe an' sound, sorta makes no\\ndifference who thet son of a gun was,” he said.\\n\\n“Riggs! Harve Riggs!” blazed Bo. “The instant I recognized him I got\\nover my scare. And so mad I burned all through like fire. I don't know\\nwhat I said, but it was wild  and it was a whole lot, you bet.\\n\\n“You sure can ride,' he said.\\n\\n“I demanded why he had dared to chase me, and he said he had an\\nimportant message for Nell. This was it: 'Tell your sister that Beasley\\nmeans to put her off an' take the ranch. If she'll marry me I'll block\\nhis deal. If she won't marry me, I'll go in with Beasley.' Then he told\\nme to hurry home and not to breathe a word to any one except Nell. Well,\\nhere I am  and I seem to have been breathing rather fast.”\\n\\nShe looked from Helen to Roy and from Roy to Las Vegas. Her smile was\\nfor the latter, and to any one not overexcited by her story that smile\\nwould have told volumes.\\n\\n“Wal, I'll be doggoned!” ejaculated Roy, feelingly.\\n\\nHelen laughed.\\n\\n“Indeed, the working of that man's mind is beyond me... Marry him to\\nsave my ranch? I wouldn't marry him to save my life!”\\n\\nCarmichael suddenly broke his silence.\\n\\n“Bo, did you see the other men?”\\n\\n“Yes. I was coming to that,” she replied. “I caught a glimpse of\\nthem back in the cedars. The three were together, or, at least, three\\nhorsemen were there. They had halted behind some trees. Then on the way\\nhome I began to think. Even in my fury I had received impressions. Riggs\\nwas SURPRISED when I got up. I'll bet he had not expected me to be who I\\nwas. He thought I was NELL!... I look bigger in this buckskin outfit. My\\nhair was up till I lost my hat, and that was when I had the tumble. He\\ntook me for Nell. Another thing, I remember  he made some sign  some\\nmotion while I was calling him names, and I believe that was to keep\\nthose other men back... I believe Riggs had a plan with those other men\\nto waylay Nell and make off with her. I absolutely know it.”\\n\\n“Bo, you're so  so  you jump at wild ideas so,” protested Helen, trying\\nto believe in her own assurance. But inwardly she was trembling.\\n\\n“Miss Helen, that ain't a wild idee,” said Roy, seriously. “I reckon\\nyour sister is pretty close on the trail. Las Vegas, don't you savvy it\\nthet way?”\\n\\nCarmichael's answer was to stalk out of the room.\\n\\n“Call him back!” cried Helen, apprehensively.\\n\\n“Hold on, boy!” called Roy, sharply.\\n\\nHelen reached the door simultaneously with Roy. The cowboy picked up his\\nsombrero, jammed it on his head, gave his belt a vicious hitch that made\\nthe gun sheath jump, and then in one giant step he was astride Ranger.\\n\\n“Carmichael! Stay!” cried Helen.\\n\\nThe cowboy spurred the black, and the stones rang under iron shod hoofs.\\n\\n“Bo! Call him back! Please call him back!” importuned Helen, in\\ndistress.\\n\\n“I won't,” declared Bo Rayner. Her face shone whiter now and her eyes\\nwere like fiery flint. That was her answer to a loving, gentle hearted\\nsister; that was her answer to the call of the West.\\n\\n“No use,” said Roy, quietly. “An' I reckon I'd better trail him up.”\\n\\nHe, too, strode out and, mounting his horse, galloped swiftly away.\\n\\n\\nIt turned out that Bo, was more bruised and scraped and shaken than she\\nhad imagined. One knee was rather badly cut, which injury alone would\\nhave kept her from riding again very soon. Helen, who was somewhat\\nskilled at bandaging wounds, worried a great deal over these sundry\\nblotches on Bo's fair skin, and it took considerable time to wash and\\ndress them. Long after this was done, and during the early supper, and\\nafterward, Bo's excitement remained unabated. The whiteness stayed on\\nher face and the blaze in her eyes. Helen ordered and begged her to go\\nto bed, for the fact was Bo could not stand up and her hands shook.\\n\\n“Go to bed? Not much,” she said. “I want to know what he does to Riggs.”\\n\\nIt was that possibility which had Helen in dreadful suspense. If\\nCarmichael killed Riggs, it seemed to Helen that the bottom would\\ndrop out of this structure of Western life she had begun to build so\\nearnestly and fearfully. She did not believe that he would do so. But\\nthe uncertainty was torturing.\\n\\n“Dear Bo,” appealed Helen, “you don't want  Oh! you do want Carmichael\\nto  to kill Riggs?”\\n\\n“No, I don't, but I wouldn't care if he did,” replied Bo, bluntly.\\n\\n“Do you think  he will?”\\n\\n“Nell, if that cowboy really loves me he read my mind right here before\\nhe left,” declared Bo. “And he knew what I thought he'd do.”\\n\\n“And what's  that?” faltered Helen.\\n\\n“I want him to round Riggs up down in the village  somewhere in a crowd.\\nI want Riggs shown up as the coward, braggart, four flush that he is.\\nAnd insulted, slapped, kicked  driven out of Pine!”\\n\\nHer passionate speech still rang throughout the room when there came\\nfootsteps on the porch. Helen hurried to raise the bar from the door and\\nopen it just as a tap sounded on the door post. Roy's face stood white\\nout of the darkness. His eyes were bright. And his smile made Helen's\\nfearful query needless.\\n\\n“How are you all this evenin'?” he drawled, as he came in.\\n\\nA fire blazed on the hearth and a lamp burned on the table. By their\\nlight Bo looked white and eager eyed as she reclined in the big\\narm chair.\\n\\n“What 'd he do?” she asked, with all her amazing force.\\n\\n“Wal, now, ain't you goin' to tell me how you are?”\\n\\n“Roy, I'm all bunged up. I ought to be in bed, but I just couldn't sleep\\ntill I hear what Las Vegas did. I'd forgive anything except him getting\\ndrunk.”\\n\\n“Wal, I shore can ease your mind on thet,” replied Roy. “He never drank\\na drop.”\\n\\nRoy was distractingly slow about beginning the tale any child could have\\nguessed he was eager to tell. For once the hard, intent quietness, the\\nsoul of labor, pain, and endurance so plain in his face was softened by\\npleasurable emotion. He poked at the burning logs with the toe of his\\nboot. Helen observed that he had changed his boots and now wore no\\nspurs. Then he had gone to his quarters after whatever had happened down\\nin Pine.\\n\\n“Where IS he?” asked Bo.\\n\\n“Who? Riggs? Wal, I don't know. But I reckon he's somewhere out in the\\nwoods nursin' himself.”\\n\\n“Not Riggs. First tell me where HE is.”\\n\\n“Shore, then, you must mean Las Vegas. I just left him down at the\\ncabin. He was gettin' ready for bed, early as it is. All tired out he\\nwas an' thet white you wouldn't have knowed him. But he looked happy at\\nthet, an' the last words he said, more to himself than to me, I reckon,\\nwas, 'I'm some locoed gent, but if she doesn't call me Tom now she's no\\ngood!'”\\n\\nBo actually clapped her hands, notwithstanding that one of them was\\nbandaged.\\n\\n“Call him Tom? I should smile I will,” she declared, in delight. “Hurry\\nnow  what 'd  ”\\n\\n“It's shore powerful strange how he hates thet handle Las Vegas,” went\\non Roy, imperturbably.\\n\\n“Roy, tell me what he did  what TOM did  or I'll scream,” cried Bo.\\n\\n“Miss Helen, did you ever see the likes of thet girl?” asked Roy,\\nappealing to Helen.\\n\\n“No, Roy, I never did,” agreed Helen. “But please  please tell us what\\nhas happened.”\\n\\nRoy grinned and rubbed his hands together in a dark delight, almost\\nfiendish in its sudden revelation of a gulf of strange emotion deep\\nwithin him. Whatever had happened to Riggs had not been too much for\\nRoy Beeman. Helen remembered hearing her uncle say that a real Westerner\\nhated nothing so hard as the swaggering desperado, the make believe\\ngunman who pretended to sail under the true, wild, and reckoning colors\\nof the West.\\n\\nRoy leaned his lithe, tall form against the stone mantelpiece and faced\\nthe girls.\\n\\n“When I rode out after Las Vegas I seen him 'way down the road,” began\\nRoy, rapidly. “An' I seen another man ridin' down into Pine from the\\nother side. Thet was Riggs, only I didn't know it then. Las Vegas rode\\nup to the store, where some fellars was hangin' round, an' he spoke to\\nthem. When I come up they was all headin' for Turner's saloon. I seen a\\ndozen hosses hitched to the rails. Las Vegas rode on. But I got off at\\nTurner's an' went in with the bunch. Whatever it was Las Vegas said\\nto them fellars, shore they didn't give him away. Pretty soon more men\\nstrolled into Turner's an' there got to be 'most twenty altogether, I\\nreckon. Jeff Mulvey was there with his pards. They had been drinkin'\\nsorta free. An' I didn't like the way Mulvey watched me. So I went\\nout an' into the store, but kept a lookin' for Las Vegas. He wasn't in\\nsight. But I seen Riggs ridin' up. Now, Turner's is where Riggs hangs\\nout an' does his braggin'. He looked powerful deep an' thoughtful,\\ndismounted slow without seein' the unusual number of hosses there, an'\\nthen he slouches into Turner's. No more 'n a minute after Las Vegas rode\\ndown there like a streak. An' just as quick he was off an' through thet\\ndoor.”\\n\\nRoy paused as if to gain force or to choose his words. His tale now\\nappeared all directed to Bo, who gazed at him, spellbound, a fascinated\\nlistener.\\n\\n“Before I got to Turner's door  an' thet was only a little ways  I heard\\nLas Vegas yell. Did you ever hear him? Wal, he's got the wildest yell\\nof any cow puncher I ever beard. Quicklike I opened the door an' slipped\\nin. There was Riggs an' Las Vegas alone in the center of the big saloon,\\nwith the crowd edgin' to the walls an' slidin' back of the bar. Riggs\\nwas whiter 'n a dead man. I didn't hear an' I don't know what Las Vegas\\nyelled at him. But Riggs knew an' so did the gang. All of a sudden every\\nman there shore seen in Las Vegas what Riggs had always bragged HE was.\\nThet time comes to every man like Riggs.\\n\\n“'What 'd you call me?' he asked, his jaw shakin'.\\n\\n“'I 'ain't called you yet,' answered Las Vegas. 'I just whooped.'\\n\\n“'What d'ye want?'\\n\\n“'You scared my girl.'\\n\\n“'The hell ye say! Who's she?' blustered Riggs, an' he began to take\\nquick looks 'round. But he never moved a hand. There was somethin' tight\\nabout the way he stood. Las Vegas had both arms half out, stretched as\\nif he meant to leap. But he wasn't. I never seen Las Vegas do thet, but\\nwhen I seen him then I understood it.\\n\\n“'You know. An' you threatened her an' her sister. Go for your gun,'\\ncalled Las Vegas, low an' sharp.\\n\\n“Thet put the crowd right an' nobody moved. Riggs turned green then. I\\nalmost felt sorry for him. He began to shake so he'd dropped a gun if he\\nhad pulled one.\\n\\n“'Hyar, you're off  some mistake  I 'ain't seen no gurls  I  '\\n\\n“'Shut up an' draw!' yelled Las Vegas. His voice just pierced holes in\\nthe roof, an' it might have been a bullet from the way Riggs collapsed.\\nEvery man seen in a second more thet Riggs wouldn't an' couldn't draw.\\nHe was afraid for his life. He was not what he had claimed to be. I\\ndon't know if he had any friends there. But in the West good men an' bad\\nmen, all alike, have no use for Riggs's kind. An' thet stony quiet broke\\nwith haw  haw. It shore was as pitiful to see Riggs as it was fine to\\nsee Las Vegas.\\n\\n“When he dropped his arms then I knowed there would be no gun play. An'\\nthen Las Vegas got red in the face. He slapped Riggs with one hand,\\nthen with the other. An' he began to cuss him. I shore never knowed\\nthet nice spoken Las Vegas Carmichael could use such language. It was a\\nstream of the baddest names known out here, an' lots I never heard of.\\nNow an' then I caught somethin' like low down an' sneak an' four flush\\nan' long haired skunk, but for the most part they was just the cussedest\\nkind of names. An' Las Vegas spouted them till he was black in the face,\\nan' foamin' at the mouth, an' hoarser 'n a bawlin' cow.\\n\\n“When he got out of breath from cussin' he punched Riggs all about the\\nsaloon, threw him outdoors, knocked him down an' kicked him till he got\\nkickin' him down the road with the whole haw hawed gang behind. An' he\\ndrove him out of town!”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nFor two days Bo was confined to her bed, suffering considerable pain,\\nand subject to fever, during which she talked irrationally. Some of this\\ntalk afforded Helen as vast an amusement as she was certain it would\\nhave lifted Tom Carmichael to a seventh heaven.\\n\\nThe third day, however, Bo was better, and, refusing to remain in bed,\\nshe hobbled to the sitting room, where she divided her time between\\nstaring out of the window toward the corrals and pestering Helen with\\nquestions she tried to make appear casual. But Helen saw through her\\ncase and was in a state of glee. What she hoped most for was that\\nCarmichael would suddenly develop a little less inclination for Bo. It\\nwas that kind of treatment the young lady needed. And now was the great\\nopportunity. Helen almost felt tempted to give the cowboy a hint.\\n\\nNeither this day, nor the next, however, did he put in an appearance\\nat the house, though Helen saw him twice on her rounds. He was busy, as\\nusual, and greeted her as if nothing particular had happened.\\n\\nRoy called twice, once in the afternoon, and again during the evening.\\nHe grew more likable upon longer acquaintance. This last visit he\\nrendered Bo speechless by teasing her about another girl Carmichael was\\ngoing to take to a dance. Bo's face showed that her vanity could not\\nbelieve this statement, but that her intelligence of young men credited\\nit with being possible. Roy evidently was as penetrating as he was kind.\\nHe made a dry, casual little remark about the snow never melting on the\\nmountains during the latter part of March; and the look with which he\\naccompanied this remark brought a blush to Helen's cheek.\\n\\nAfter Roy had departed Bo said to Helen: “Confound that fellow! He sees\\nright through me.”\\n\\n“My dear, you're rather transparent these days,” murmured Helen.\\n\\n“You needn't talk. He gave you a dig,” retorted Bo. “He just knows\\nyou're dying to see the snow melt.”\\n\\n“Gracious! I hope I'm not so bad as that. Of course I want the snow\\nmelted and spring to come, and flowers  ”\\n\\n“Hal Ha! Ha!” taunted Bo. “Nell Rayner, do you see any green in my eyes?\\nSpring to come! Yes, the poet said in the spring a young man's fancy\\nlightly turns to thoughts of love. But that poet meant a young woman.”\\n\\nHelen gazed out of the window at the white stars.\\n\\n“Nell, have you seen him  since I was hurt?” continued Bo, with an\\neffort.\\n\\n“Him? Who?”\\n\\n“Oh, whom do you suppose? I mean Tom!” she responded, and the last word\\ncame with a burst.\\n\\n“Tom? Who's he? Ah, you mean Las Vegas. Yes, I've seen him.”\\n\\n“Well, did he ask a about me?”\\n\\n“I believe he did ask how you were  something like that.”\\n\\n“Humph! Nell, I don't always trust you.” After that she relapsed into\\nsilence, read awhile, and dreamed awhile, looking into the fire, and\\nthen she limped over to kiss Helen good night and left the room.\\n\\nNext day she was rather quiet, seeming upon the verge of one of the\\ndispirited spells she got infrequently. Early in the evening, just after\\nthe lights had been lit and she had joined Helen in the sitting room, a\\nfamiliar step sounded on the loose boards of the porch.\\n\\nHelen went to the door to admit Carmichael. He was clean shaven,\\ndressed in his dark suit, which presented such marked contrast from\\nhis riding garb, and he wore a flower in his buttonhole. Nevertheless,\\ndespite all this style, he seemed more than usually the cool, easy,\\ncareless cowboy.\\n\\n“Evenin', Miss Helen,” he said, as he stalked in. “Evenin', Miss Bo. How\\nare you all?”\\n\\nHelen returned his greeting with a welcoming smile.\\n\\n“Good evening  TOM,” said Bo, demurely.\\n\\nThat assuredly was the first time she had ever called him Tom. As she\\nspoke she looked distractingly pretty and tantalizing. But if she had\\ncalculated to floor Carmichael with the initial, half promising, wholly\\nmocking use of his name she had reckoned without cause. The cowboy\\nreceived that greeting as if he had heard her use it a thousand times\\nor had not heard it at all. Helen decided if he was acting a part he\\nwas certainly a clever actor. He puzzled her somewhat, but she liked his\\nlook, and his easy manner, and the something about him that must have\\nbeen his unconscious sense of pride. He had gone far enough, perhaps too\\nfar, in his overtures to Bo.\\n\\n“How are you feelin'?” he asked.\\n\\n“I'm better to day,” she replied, with downcast eyes. “But I'm lame\\nyet.”\\n\\n“Reckon that bronc piled you up. Miss Helen said there shore wasn't any\\njoke about the cut on your knee. Now, a fellar's knee is a bad place to\\nhurt, if he has to keep on ridin'.”\\n\\n“Oh, I'll be well soon. How's Sam? I hope he wasn't crippled.”\\n\\n“Thet Sam  why, he's so tough he never knowed he had a fall.”\\n\\n“Tom  I  I want to thank you for giving Riggs what he deserved.”\\n\\nShe spoke it earnestly, eloquently, and for once she had no sly little\\nintonation or pert allurement, such as was her wont to use on this\\ninfatuated young man.\\n\\n“Aw, you heard about that,” replied Carmichael, with a wave of his hand\\nto make light of it. “Nothin' much. It had to be done. An' shore I was\\nafraid of Roy. He'd been bad. An' so would any of the other boys. I'm\\nsorta lookin' out for all of them, you know, actin' as Miss Helen's\\nforeman now.”\\n\\nHelen was unutterably tickled. The effect of his speech upon Bo was\\nstupendous. He had disarmed her. He had, with the finesse and tact\\nand suavity of a diplomat, removed himself from obligation, and the\\ndetachment of self, the casual thing be apparently made out of his\\nmagnificent championship, was bewildering and humiliating to Bo. She\\nsat silent for a moment or two while Helen tried to fit easily into\\nthe conversation. It was not likely that Bo would long be at a loss\\nfor words, and also it was immensely probable that with a flash of her\\nwonderful spirit she would turn the tables on her perverse lover in a\\ntwinkling. Anyway, plain it was that a lesson had sunk deep. She looked\\nstartled, hurt, wistful, and finally sweetly defiant.\\n\\n“But  you told Riggs I was your girl!” Thus Bo unmasked her battery. And\\nHelen could not imagine how Carmichael would ever resist that and the\\nsoft, arch glance which accompanied it.\\n\\nHelen did not yet know the cowboy, any more than did Bo.\\n\\n“Shore. I had to say thet. I had to make it strong before thet gang. I\\nreckon it was presumin' of me, an' I shore apologize.”\\n\\nBo stared at him, and then, giving a little gasp, she drooped.\\n\\n“Wal, I just run in to say howdy an' to inquire after you all,” said\\nCarmichael. “I'm goin' to the dance, an' as Flo lives out of town a ways\\nI'd shore better rustle... Good night, Miss Bo; I hope you'll be ridin'\\nSam soon. An' good night, Miss Helen.”\\n\\nBo roused to a very friendly and laconic little speech, much overdone.\\nCarmichael strode out, and Helen, bidding him good by, closed the door\\nafter him.\\n\\nThe instant he had departed Bo's transformation was tragic.\\n\\n“Flo! He meant Flo Stubbs  that ugly, cross eyed, bold, little frump!”\\n\\n“Bo!” expostulated Helen. “The young lady is not beautiful, I grant, but\\nshe's very nice and pleasant. I liked her.”\\n\\n“Nell Rayner, men are no good! And cowboys are the worst!” declared Bo,\\nterribly.\\n\\n“Why didn't you appreciate Tom when you had him?” asked Helen.\\n\\nBo had been growing furious, but now the allusion, in past tense, to\\nthe conquest she had suddenly and amazingly found dear quite broke her\\nspirit. It was a very pale, unsteady, and miserable girl who avoided\\nHelen's gaze and left the room.\\n\\nNext day Bo was not approachable from any direction. Helen found her\\na victim to a multiplicity of moods, ranging from woe to dire, dark\\nbroodings, from them to' wistfulness, and at last to a pride that\\nsustained her.\\n\\nLate in the afternoon, at Helen's leisure hour, when she and Bo were in\\nthe sitting room, horses tramped into the court and footsteps mounted\\nthe porch. Opening to a loud knock, Helen was surprised to see Beasley.\\nAnd out in the court were several mounted horsemen. Helen's heart sank.\\nThis visit, indeed, had been foreshadowed.\\n\\n“Afternoon, Miss Rayner,” said Beasley, doffing his sombrero. “I've\\ncalled on a little business deal. Will you see me?”\\n\\nHelen acknowledged his greeting while she thought rapidly. She might\\njust as well see him and have that inevitable interview done with.\\n\\n“Come in,” she said, and when he had entered she closed the door. “My\\nsister, Mr. Beasley.”\\n\\n“How d' you do, Miss?” said the rancher, in bluff, loud voice.\\n\\nBo acknowledged the introduction with a frigid little bow.\\n\\nAt close range Beasley seemed a forceful personality as well as a rather\\nhandsome man of perhaps thirty five, heavy of build, swarthy of skin,\\nand sloe black of eye, like that of the Mexicans whose blood was\\nreported to be in him. He looked crafty, confident, and self centered.\\nIf Helen had never heard of him before that visit she would have\\ndistrusted him.\\n\\n“I'd called sooner, but I was waitin' for old Jose, the Mexican who\\nherded for me when I was pardner to your uncle,” said Beasley, and he\\nsat down to put his huge gloved hands on his knees.\\n\\n“Yes?” queried Helen, interrogatively.\\n\\n“Jose rustled over from Magdalena, an' now I can back up my claim...\\nMiss Rayner, this hyar ranch ought to be mine an' is mine. It wasn't so\\nbig or so well stocked when Al Auchincloss beat me out of it. I reckon\\nI'll allow for thet. I've papers, an' old Jose for witness. An' I\\ncalculate you'll pay me eighty thousand dollars, or else I'll take over\\nthe ranch.”\\n\\nBeasley spoke in an ordinary, matter of fact tone that certainly seemed\\nsincere, and his manner was blunt, but perfectly natural.\\n\\n“Mr. Beasley, your claim is no news to me,” responded Helen, quietly.\\n“I've heard about it. And I questioned my uncle. He swore on his\\ndeath bed that he did not owe you a dollar. Indeed, he claimed the\\nindebtedness was yours to him. I could find nothing in his papers, so I\\nmust repudiate your claim. I will not take it seriously.”\\n\\n“Miss Rayner, I can't blame you for takin' Al's word against mine,” said\\nBeasley. “An' your stand is natural. But you're a stranger here an' you\\nknow nothin' of stock deals in these ranges. It ain't fair to speak\\nbad of the dead, but the truth is thet Al Auchincloss got his start by\\nstealin' sheep an' unbranded cattle. Thet was the start of every rancher\\nI know. It was mine. An' we none of us ever thought of it as rustlin'.”\\n\\nHelen could only stare her surprise and doubt at this statement.\\n\\n“Talk's cheap anywhere, an' in the West talk ain't much at all,”\\n continued Beasley. “I'm no talker. I jest want to tell my case an' make\\na deal if you'll have it. I can prove more in black an' white, an' with\\nwitness, than you can. Thet's my case. The deal I'd make is this...\\nLet's marry an' settle a bad deal thet way.”\\n\\nThe man's direct assumption, absolutely without a qualifying\\nconsideration for her woman's attitude, was amazing, ignorant, and base;\\nbut Helen was so well prepared for it that she hid her disgust.\\n\\n“Thank you, Mr. Beasley, but I can't accept your offer,” she replied.\\n\\n“Would you take time an' consider?” he asked, spreading wide his huge\\ngloved hands.\\n\\n“Absolutely no.”\\n\\nBeasley rose to his feet. He showed no disappointment or chagrin, but\\nthe bold pleasantness left his face, and, slight as that change was, it\\nstripped him of the only redeeming quality he showed.\\n\\n“Thet means I'll force you to pay me the eighty thousand or put you\\noff,” he said.\\n\\n“Mr. Beasley, even if I owed you that, how could I raise so enormous a\\nsum? I don't owe it. And I certainly won't be put off my property. You\\ncan't put me off.”\\n\\n“An' why can't I?” he demanded, with lowering, dark gaze.\\n\\n“Because your claim is dishonest. And I can prove it,” declared Helen,\\nforcibly.\\n\\n“Who 're you goin' to prove it to  thet I'm dishonest?”\\n\\n“To my men  to your men  to the people of Pine  to everybody. There's\\nnot a person who won't believe me.”\\n\\nHe seemed curious, discomfited, surlily annoyed, and yet fascinated\\nby her statement or else by the quality and appearance of her as she\\nspiritedly defended her cause.\\n\\n“An' how 're you goin' to prove all thet?” he growled.\\n\\n“Mr. Beasley, do you remember last fall when you met Snake Anson with\\nhis gang up in the woods  and hired him to make off with me?” asked\\nHelen, in swift, ringing words.\\n\\nThe dark olive of Beasley's bold face shaded to a dirty white.\\n\\n“Wha at?” he jerked out, hoarsely.\\n\\n“I see you remember. Well, Milt Dale was hidden in the loft of that\\ncabin where you met Anson. He heard every word of your deal with the\\noutlaw.”\\n\\nBeasley swung his arm in sudden violence, so hard that he flung his\\nglove to the floor. As he stooped to snatch it up he uttered a sibilant\\nhiss. Then, stalking to the door, he jerked it open, and slammed it\\nbehind him. His loud voice, hoarse with passion, preceded the scrape and\\ncrack of hoofs.\\n\\n\\nShortly after supper that day, when Helen was just recovering her\\ncomposure, Carmichael presented himself at the open door. Bo was not\\nthere. In the dimming twilight Helen saw that the cowboy was pale,\\nsomber, grim.\\n\\n“Oh, what's happened?” cried Helen.\\n\\n“Roy's been shot. It come off in Turner's saloon But he ain't dead. We\\npacked him over to Widow Cass's. An' he said for me to tell you he'd\\npull through.”\\n\\n“Shot! Pull through!” repeated Helen, in slow, unrealizing exclamation.\\nShe was conscious of a deep internal tumult and a cold checking of blood\\nin all her external body.\\n\\n“Yes, shot,” replied Carmichael, fiercely.\\n\\n“An', whatever he says, I reckon he won't pull through.”\\n\\n“O Heaven, how terrible!” burst out Helen. “He was so good  such a\\nman! What a pity! Oh, he must have met that in my behalf. Tell me, what\\nhappened? Who shot him?”\\n\\n“Wal, I don't know. An' thet's what's made me hoppin' mad. I wasn't\\nthere when it come off. An' he won't tell me.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“I don't know thet, either. I reckoned first it was because he wanted\\nto get even. But, after thinkin' it over, I guess he doesn't want me\\nlookin' up any one right now for fear I might get hurt. An' you're goin'\\nto need your friends. Thet's all I can make of Roy.”\\n\\nThen Helen hurriedly related the event of Beasley's call on her that\\nafternoon and all that had occurred.\\n\\n“Wal, the half breed son of a greaser!” ejaculated Carmichael, in utter\\nconfoundment. “He wanted you to marry him!”\\n\\n“He certainly did. I must say it was a  a rather abrupt proposal.”\\n\\nCarmichael appeared to be laboring with speech that had to be smothered\\nbehind his teeth. At last he let out an explosive breath.\\n\\n“Miss Nell, I've shore felt in my bones thet I'm the boy slated to brand\\nthet big bull.”\\n\\n“Oh, he must have shot Roy. He left here in a rage.”\\n\\n“I reckon you can coax it out of Roy. Fact is, all I could learn was\\nthet Roy come in the saloon alone. Beasley was there, an' Riggs  ”\\n\\n“Riggs!” interrupted Helen.\\n\\n“Shore, Riggs. He come back again. But he'd better keep out of my\\nway... An' Jeff Mulvey with his outfit. Turner told me he heard an\\nargument an' then a shot. The gang cleared out, leavin' Roy on the\\nfloor. I come in a little later. Roy was still layin' there. Nobody was\\ndoin' anythin' for him. An' nobody had. I hold that against Turner. Wal,\\nI got help an' packed Roy over to Widow Cass's. Roy seemed all right.\\nBut he was too bright an' talky to suit me. The bullet hit his lung,\\nthet's shore. An' he lost a sight of blood before we stopped it. Thet\\nskunk Turner might have lent a hand. An' if Roy croaks I reckon I'll  ”\\n\\n“Tom, why must you always be reckoning to kill somebody?” demanded\\nHelen, angrily.\\n\\n“'Cause somebody's got to be killed 'round here. Thet's why!” he snapped\\nback.\\n\\n“Even so  should you risk leaving Bo and me without a friend?” asked\\nHelen, reproachfully.\\n\\nAt that Carmichael wavered and lost something of his sullen deadliness.\\n\\n“Aw, Miss Nell, I'm only mad. If you'll just be patient with me  an'\\nmebbe coax me... But I can't see no other way out.”\\n\\n“Let's hope and pray,” said Helen, earnestly. “You spoke of my coaxing\\nRoy to tell who shot him. When can I see him?”\\n\\n“To morrow, I reckon. I'll come for you. Fetch Bo along with you. We've\\ngot to play safe from now on. An' what do you say to me an' Hal sleepin'\\nhere at the ranch house?”\\n\\n“Indeed I'd feel safer,” she replied. “There are rooms. Please come.”\\n\\n“Allright. An' now I'll be goin' to fetch Hal. Shore wish I hadn't made\\nyou pale an' scared like this.”\\n\\n\\nAbout ten o'clock next morning Carmichael drove Helen and Bo into Pine,\\nand tied up the team before Widow Cass's cottage.\\n\\nThe peach and apple trees were mingling blossoms of pink and white; a\\ndrowsy hum of bees filled the fragrant air; rich, dark green alfalfa\\ncovered the small orchard flat; a wood fire sent up a lazy column of\\nblue smoke; and birds were singing sweetly.\\n\\nHelen could scarcely believe that amid all this tranquillity a man\\nlay perhaps fatally injured. Assuredly Carmichael had been somber and\\nreticent enough to rouse the gravest fears.\\n\\nWidow Cass appeared on the little porch, a gray, bent, worn, but\\ncheerful old woman whom Helen had come to know as her friend.\\n\\n“My land! I'm thet glad to see you, Miss Helen,” she said. “An' you've\\nfetched the little lass as I've not got acquainted with yet.”\\n\\n“Good morning, Mrs. Cass. How  how is Roy?” replied Helen, anxiously\\nscanning the wrinkled face.\\n\\n“Roy? Now don't you look so scared. Roy's 'most ready to git on his hoss\\nan' ride home, if I let him. He knowed you was a comin'. An' he made\\nme hold a lookin' glass for him to shave. How's thet fer a man with a\\nbullet hole through him! You can't kill them Mormons, nohow.”\\n\\nShe led them into a little sitting room, where on a couch underneath a\\nwindow Roy Beeman lay. He was wide awake and smiling, but haggard. He\\nlay partly covered with a blanket. His gray shirt was open at the neck,\\ndisclosing bandages.\\n\\n“Mornin'  girls,” he drawled. “Shore is good of you, now, comin' down.”\\n\\nHelen stood beside him, bent over him, in her earnestness, as she\\ngreeted him. She saw a shade of pain in his eyes and his immobility\\nstruck her, but he did not seem badly off. Bo was pale, round eyed, and\\napparently too agitated to speak. Carmichael placed chairs beside the\\ncouch for the girls.\\n\\n“Wal, what's ailin' you this nice mornin'?” asked Roy, eyes on the\\ncowboy.\\n\\n“Huh! Would you expect me to be wearin' the smile of a fellar goin' to\\nbe married?” retorted Carmichael.\\n\\n“Shore you haven't made up with Bo yet,” returned Roy.\\n\\nBo blushed rosy red, and the cowboy's face lost something of its somber\\nhue.\\n\\n“I allow it's none of your d  darn bizness if SHE ain't made up with\\nme,” he said.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, you're a wonder with a hoss an' a rope, an' I reckon with a\\ngun, but when it comes to girls you shore ain't there.”\\n\\n“I'm no Mormon, by golly! Come, Ma Cass, let's get out of here, so they\\ncan talk.”\\n\\n“Folks, I was jest a goin' to say thet Roy's got fever an' he oughtn't\\nt' talk too much,” said the old woman. Then she and Carmichael went into\\nthe kitchen and closed the door.\\n\\nRoy looked up at Helen with his keen eyes, more kindly piercing than\\never.\\n\\n“My brother John was here. He'd just left when you come. He rode home\\nto tell my folks I'm not so bad hurt, an' then he's goin' to ride a\\nbee line into the mountains.”\\n\\nHelen's eyes asked what her lips refused to utter.\\n\\n“He's goin' after Dale. I sent him. I reckoned we all sorta needed sight\\nof thet doggone hunter.”\\n\\nRoy had averted his gaze quickly to Bo.\\n\\n“Don't you agree with me, lass?”\\n\\n“I sure do,” replied Bo, heartily.\\n\\nAll within Helen had been stilled for the moment of her realization; and\\nthen came swell and beat of heart, and inconceivable chafing of a tide\\nat its restraint.\\n\\n“Can John  fetch Dale out  when the snow's so deep?” she asked,\\nunsteadily.\\n\\n“Shore. He's takin' two hosses up to the snow line. Then, if necessary,\\nhe'll go over the pass on snow shoes. But I bet him Dale would ride out.\\nSnow's about gone except on the north slopes an' on the peaks.”\\n\\n“Then  when may I  we expect to see Dale?”\\n\\n“Three or four days, I reckon. I wish he was here now... Miss Helen,\\nthere's trouble afoot.”\\n\\n“I realize that. I'm ready. Did Las Vegas tell you about Beasley's visit\\nto me?”\\n\\n“No. You tell me,” replied Roy.\\n\\nBriefly Helen began to acquaint him with the circumstances of that\\nvisit, and before she had finished she made sure Roy was swearing to\\nhimself.\\n\\n“He asked you to marry him! Jerusalem!... Thet I'd never have reckoned.\\nThe  low down coyote of a greaser!... Wal, Miss Helen, when I met up\\nwith Senor Beasley last night he was shore spoilin' from somethin'; now\\nI see what thet was. An' I reckon I picked out the bad time.”\\n\\n“For what? Roy, what did you do?”\\n\\n“Wal, I'd made up my mind awhile back to talk to Beasley the first\\nchance I had. An' thet was it. I was in the store when I seen him go\\ninto Turner's. So I followed. It was 'most dark. Beasley an' Riggs an'\\nMulvey an' some more were drinkin' an' powwowin'. So I just braced him\\nright then.”\\n\\n“Roy! Oh, the way you boys court danger!”\\n\\n“But, Miss Helen, thet's the only way. To be afraid MAKES more danger.\\nBeasley 'peared civil enough first off. Him an' me kept edgin' off,\\nan' his pards kept edgin' after us, till we got over in a corner of the\\nsaloon. I don't know all I said to him. Shore I talked a heap. I told\\nhim what my old man thought. An' Beasley knowed as well as I thet my old\\nman's not only the oldest inhabitant hereabouts, but he's the wisest,\\ntoo. An' he wouldn't tell a lie. Wal, I used all his sayin's in my\\nargument to show Beasley thet if he didn't haul up short he'd end almost\\nas short. Beasley's thick headed, an' powerful conceited. Vain as a\\npeacock! He couldn't see, an' he got mad. I told him he was rich enough\\nwithout robbin' you of your ranch, an'  wal, I shore put up a big talk\\nfor your side. By this time he an' his gang had me crowded in a corner,\\nan' from their looks I begun to get cold feet. But I was in it an' had\\nto make the best of it. The argument worked down to his pinnin' me to my\\nword that I'd fight for you when thet fight come off. An' I shore told\\nhim for my own sake I wished it 'd come off quick... Then  wal  then\\nsomethin' did come off quick!”\\n\\n“Roy, then he shot you!” exclaimed Helen, passionately.\\n\\n“Now, Miss Helen, I didn't say who done it,” replied Roy, with his\\nengaging smile.\\n\\n“Tell me, then  who did?”\\n\\n“Wal, I reckon I sha'n't tell you unless you promise not to tell Las\\nVegas. Thet cowboy is plumb off his head. He thinks he knows who shot\\nme an' I've been lyin' somethin' scandalous. You see, if he learns  then\\nhe'll go gunnin'. An', Miss Helen, thet Texan is bad. He might get\\nplugged as I did  an' there would be another man put off your side when\\nthe big trouble comes.”\\n\\n“Roy, I promise you I will not tell Las Vegas,” replied Helen,\\nearnestly.\\n\\n“Wal, then  it was Riggs!” Roy grew still paler as he confessed this and\\nhis voice, almost a whisper, expressed shame and hate. “Thet four flush\\ndid it. Shot me from behind Beasley! I had no chance. I couldn't even\\nsee him draw. But when I fell an' lay there an' the others dropped back,\\nthen I seen the smokin' gun in his hand. He looked powerful important.\\nAn' Beasley began to cuss him an' was cussin' him as they all run out.”\\n\\n“Oh, coward! the despicable coward!” cried Helen.\\n\\n“No wonder Tom wants to find out!” exclaimed Bo, low and deep. “I'll bet\\nhe suspects Riggs.”\\n\\n“Shore he does, but I wouldn't give him no satisfaction.”\\n\\n“Roy, you know that Riggs can't last out here.”\\n\\n“Wal, I hope he lasts till I get on my feet again.”\\n\\n“There you go! Hopeless, all you boys! You must spill blood!” murmured\\nHelen, shudderingly.\\n\\n“Dear Miss Helen, don't take on so. I'm like Dale  no man to hunt up\\ntrouble. But out here there's a sort of unwritten law  an eye for an\\neye  a tooth for a tooth. I believe in God Almighty, an' killin' is\\nagainst my religion, but Riggs shot me  the same as shootin' me in the\\nback.”\\n\\n“Roy, I'm only a woman  I fear, faint hearted and unequal to this West.”\\n\\n“Wait till somethin' happens to you. 'Supposin' Beasley comes an' grabs\\nyou with his own dirty big paws an', after maulin' you some, throws you\\nout of your home! Or supposin' Riggs chases you into a corner!”\\n\\nHelen felt the start of all her physical being  a violent leap of blood.\\nBut she could only judge of her looks from the grim smile of the wounded\\nman as he watched her with his keen, intent eyes.\\n\\n“My friend, anythin' can happen,” he said. “But let's hope it won't be\\nthe worst.”\\n\\nHe had begun to show signs of weakness, and Helen, rising at once, said\\nthat she and Bo had better leave him then, but would come to see him the\\nnext day. At her call Carmichael entered again with Mrs. Cass, and\\nafter a few remarks the visit was terminated. Carmichael lingered in the\\ndoorway.\\n\\n“Wal, Cheer up, you old Mormon!” he called.\\n\\n“Cheer up yourself, you cross old bachelor!” retorted Roy, quite\\nunnecessarily loud. “Can't you raise enough nerve to make up with Bo?”\\n\\nCarmichael evacuated the doorway as if he had been spurred. He was quite\\nred in the face while he unhitched the team, and silent during the ride\\nup to the ranch house. There he got down and followed the girls into the\\nsitting room. He appeared still somber, though not sullen, and had fully\\nregained his composure.\\n\\n“Did you find out who shot Roy?” he asked, abruptly, of Helen.\\n\\n“Yes. But I promised Roy I would not tell,” replied Helen, nervously.\\nShe averted her eyes from his searching gaze, intuitively fearing his\\nnext query.\\n\\n“Was it thet  Riggs?”\\n\\n“Las Vegas, don't ask me. I will not break my promise.”\\n\\nHe strode to the window and looked out a moment, and presently, when\\nhe turned toward Bo, he seemed a stronger, loftier, more impelling man,\\nwith all his emotions under control.\\n\\n“Bo, will you listen to me  if I swear to speak the truth  as I know\\nit?”\\n\\n“Why, certainly,” replied Bo, with the color coming swiftly to her face.\\n\\n“Roy doesn't want me to know because he wants to meet thet fellar\\nhimself. An' I want to know because I want to stop him before he can do\\nmore dirt to us or our friends. Thet's Roy's reason an' mine. An' I'm\\naskin' YOU to tell me.”\\n\\n“But, Tom  I oughtn't,” replied Bo, haltingly.\\n\\n“Did you promise Roy not to tell?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Or your sister?”\\n\\n“No. I didn't promise either.”\\n\\n“Wal, then you tell me. I want you to trust me in this here matter. But\\nnot because I love you an' once had a wild dream you might care a little\\nfor me  ”\\n\\n“Oh  Tom!” faltered Bo.\\n\\n“Listen. I want you to trust me because I'm the one who knows what's\\nbest. I wouldn't lie an' I wouldn't say so if I didn't know shore. I\\nswear Dale will back me up. But he can't be here for some days. An' thet\\ngang has got to be bluffed. You ought to see this. I reckon you've been\\nquick in savvyin' Western ways. I couldn't pay you no higher compliment,\\nBo Rayner... Now will you tell me?”\\n\\n“Yes, I will,” replied Bo, with the blaze leaping to her eyes.\\n\\n“Oh, Bo  please don't  please don't. Wait!” implored Helen.\\n\\n“Bo  it's between you an' me,” said Carmichael.\\n\\n“Tom, I'll tell you,” whispered Bo. “It was a lowdown, cowardly\\ntrick... Roy was surrounded  and shot from behind Beasley  by that\\nfour flush Riggs!”\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\nThe memory of a woman had ruined Milt Dale's peace, had confounded his\\nphilosophy of self sufficient, lonely happiness in the solitude of the\\nwilds, had forced him to come face to face with his soul and the fatal\\nsignificance of life.\\n\\nWhen he realized his defeat, that things were not as they seemed, that\\nthere was no joy for him in the coming of spring, that he had been blind\\nin his free, sensorial, Indian relation to existence, he fell into\\nan inexplicably strange state, a despondency, a gloom as deep as the\\nsilence of his home. Dale reflected that the stronger an animal, the\\nkeener its nerves, the higher its intelligence, the greater must be its\\nsuffering under restraint or injury. He thought of himself as a high\\norder of animal whose great physical need was action, and now the\\nincentive to action seemed dead. He grew lax. He did not want to move.\\nHe performed his diminishing duties under compulsion.\\n\\nHe watched for spring as a liberation, but not that he could leave the\\nvalley. He hated the cold, he grew weary of wind and snow; he imagined\\nthe warm sun, the park once more green with grass and bright with\\ndaisies, the return of birds and squirrels and deer to heir old haunts,\\nwould be the means whereby he could break this spell upon him. Then he\\nmight gradually return to past contentment, though it would never be the\\nsame.\\n\\nBut spring, coming early to Paradise Park, brought a fever to Dale's\\nblood  a fire of unutterable longing. It was good, perhaps, that\\nthis was so, because he seemed driven to work, climb, tramp, and keep\\nceaselessly on the move from dawn till dark. Action strengthened his lax\\nmuscles and kept him from those motionless, senseless hours of brooding.\\nHe at least need not be ashamed of longing for that which could never\\nbe his  the sweetness of a woman  a home full of light, joy, hope, the\\nmeaning and beauty of children. But those dark moods were sinkings into\\na pit of hell.\\n\\nDale had not kept track of days and weeks. He did not know when the snow\\nmelted off three slopes of Paradise Park. All he knew was that an age\\nhad dragged over his head and that spring had come. During his restless\\nwaking hours, and even when he was asleep, there seemed always in the\\nback of his mind a growing consciousness that soon he would emerge from\\nthis trial, a changed man, ready to sacrifice his chosen lot, to give up\\nhis lonely life of selfish indulgence in lazy affinity with nature,\\nand to go wherever his strong hands might perform some real service\\nto people. Nevertheless, he wanted to linger in this mountain fastness\\nuntil his ordeal was over  until he could meet her, and the world,\\nknowing himself more of a man than ever before.\\n\\nOne bright morning, while he was at his camp fire, the tame cougar gave\\na low, growling warning. Dale was startled. Tom did not act like that\\nbecause of a prowling grizzly or a straying stag. Presently Dale espied\\na horseman riding slowly out of the straggling spruces. And with that\\nsight Dale's heart gave a leap, recalling to him a divination of his\\nfuture relation to his kind. Never had he been so glad to see a man!\\n\\nThis visitor resembled one of the Beemans, judging from the way he sat\\nhis horse, and presently Dale recognized him to be John.\\n\\nAt this juncture the jaded horse was spurred into a trot, soon reaching\\nthe pines and the camp.\\n\\n“Howdy, there, you ole b'ar hunter!” called John, waving his hand.\\n\\nFor all his hearty greeting his appearance checked a like response from\\nDale. The horse was mud to his flanks and John was mud to his knees,\\nwet, bedraggled, worn, and white. This hue of his face meant more than\\nfatigue.\\n\\n“Howdy, John?” replied Dale.\\n\\nThey shook hands. John wearily swung his leg over the pommel, but did\\nnot at once dismount. His clear gray eyes were wonderingly riveted upon\\nthe hunter.\\n\\n“Milt  what 'n hell's wrong?” he queried.\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Bust me if you ain't changed so I hardly knowed you. You've been\\nsick  all alone here!”\\n\\n“Do I look sick?”\\n\\n“Wal, I should smile. Thin an' pale an' down in the mouth! Milt, what\\nails you?”\\n\\n“I've gone to seed.”\\n\\n“You've gone off your head, jest as Roy said, livin' alone here. You\\noverdid it, Milt. An' you look sick.”\\n\\n“John, my sickness is here,” replied Dale, soberly, as he laid a hand on\\nhis heart.\\n\\n“Lung trouble!” ejaculated John. “With thet chest, an' up in this\\nair?... Get out!”\\n\\n“No  not lung trouble,” said Dale.\\n\\n“I savvy. Had a hunch from Roy, anyhow.”\\n\\n“What kind of a hunch?”\\n\\n“Easy now, Dale, ole man... Don't you reckon I'm ridin' in on you\\npretty early? Look at thet hoss!” John slid off and waved a hand at\\nthe drooping beast, then began to unsaddle him. “Wal, he done great. We\\nbogged some comin' over. An' I climbed the pass at night on the frozen\\nsnow.”\\n\\n“You're welcome as the flowers in May. John, what month is it?”\\n\\n“By spades! are you as bad as thet?... Let's see. It's the twenty third\\nof March.”\\n\\n“March! Well, I'm beat. I've lost my reckonin'  an' a lot more, maybe.”\\n\\n“Thar!” declared John, slapping the mustang. “You can jest hang up here\\ntill my next trip. Milt, how 're your hosses?”\\n\\n“Wintered fine.”\\n\\n“Wal, thet's good. We'll need two big, strong hosses right off.”\\n\\n“What for?” queried Dale, sharply. He dropped a stick of wood and\\nstraightened up from the camp fire.\\n\\n“You're goin' to ride down to Pine with me  thet's what for.”\\n\\nFamiliarly then came back to Dale the quiet, intent suggestiveness of\\nthe Beemans in moments foreboding trial.\\n\\nAt this certain assurance of John's, too significant to be doubted,\\nDale's thought of Pine gave slow birth to a strange sensation, as if he\\nhad been dead and was vibrating back to life.\\n\\n“Tell what you got to tell!” he broke out.\\n\\nQuick as a flash the Mormon replied: “Roy's been shot. But he won't die.\\nHe sent for you. Bad deal's afoot. Beasley means to force Helen Rayner\\nout an' steal her ranch.”\\n\\nA tremor ran all through Dale. It seemed another painful yet thrilling\\nconnection between his past and this vaguely calling future. His\\nemotions had been broodings dreams, longings. This thing his friend said\\nhad the sting of real life.\\n\\n“Then old Al's dead?” he asked.\\n\\n“Long ago  I reckon around the middle of February. The property went to\\nHelen. She's been doin' fine. An' many folks say it's a pity she'll lose\\nit.”\\n\\n“She won't lose it,” declared Dale. How strange his voice sounded to his\\nown ears! It was hoarse and unreal, as if from disuse.\\n\\n“Wal, we all have our idees. I say she will. My father says so.\\nCarmichael says so.”\\n\\n“Who's he?”\\n\\n“Reckon you remember thet cow puncher who came up with Roy an'\\nAuchincloss after the girls  last fall?”\\n\\n“Yes. They called him Las  Las Vegas. I liked his looks.”\\n\\n“Humph! You'll like him a heap when you know him. He's kept the ranch\\ngoin' for Miss Helen all along. But the deal's comin' to a head.\\nBeasley's got thick with thet Riggs. You remember him?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Wal, he's been hangin' out at Pine all winter, watchin' for some chance\\nto get at Miss Helen or Bo. Everybody's seen thet. An' jest lately he\\nchased Bo on hossback  gave the kid a nasty fall. Roy says Riggs was\\nafter Miss Helen. But I think one or t'other of the girls would do thet\\nvarmint. Wal, thet sorta started goin's on. Carmichael beat Riggs an'\\ndrove him out of town. But he come back. Beasley called on Miss Helen\\nan' offered to marry her so's not to take the ranch from her, he said.”\\n\\nDale awoke with a thundering curse.\\n\\n“Shore!” exclaimed John. “I'd say the same  only I'm religious. Don't\\nthet beady eyed greaser's gall make you want to spit all over yourself?\\nMy Gawd! but Roy was mad! Roy's powerful fond of Miss Helen an' Bo...\\nWal, then, Roy, first chance he got, braced Beasley an' give him some\\nstraight talk. Beasley was foamin' at the mouth, Roy said. It was then\\nRiggs shot Roy. Shot him from behind Beasley when Roy wasn't lookin'!\\nAn' Riggs brags of bein' a gun fighter. Mebbe thet wasn't a bad shot for\\nhim!”\\n\\n“I reckon,” replied Dale, as he swallowed hard. “Now, just what was\\nRoy's message to me?”\\n\\n“Wal, I can't remember all Roy said,” answered John, dubiously. “But\\nRoy shore was excited an' dead in earnest. He says: 'Tell Milt what's\\nhappened. Tell him Helen Rayner's in more danger than she was last fall.\\nTell him I've seen her look away acrost the mountains toward Paradise\\nPark with her heart in her eyes. Tell him she needs him most of all!'”\\n\\nDale shook all over as with an attack of ague. He was seized by a\\nwhirlwind of passionate, terrible sweetness of sensation, when what\\nhe wildly wanted was to curse Roy and John for their simple minded\\nconclusions.\\n\\n“Roy's  crazy!” panted Dale.\\n\\n“Wal, now, Milt  thet's downright surprisin' of you. Roy's the\\nlevel headest of any fellars I know.”\\n\\n“Man! if he MADE me believe him  an' it turned out untrue  I'd  I'd kill\\nhim,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Untrue! Do you think Roy Beeman would lie?”\\n\\n“But, John  you fellows can't see my case. Nell Rayner wants me  needs\\nme!... It can't be true!”\\n\\n“Wal, my love sick pard  it jest IS true!” exclaimed John, feelingly.\\n“Thet's the hell of life  never knowin'. But here it's joy for you. You\\ncan believe Roy Beeman about women as quick as you'd trust him to track\\nyour lost hoss. Roy's married three girls. I reckon he'll marry some\\nmore. Roy's only twenty eight an' he has two big farms. He said he'd\\nseen Nell Rayner's heart in her eyes, lookin' for you  an' you can jest\\nbet your life thet's true. An' he said it because he means you to rustle\\ndown there an' fight for thet girl.”\\n\\n“I'll  go,” said Dale, in a shaky whisper, as he sat down on a pine log\\nnear the fire. He stared unseeingly at the bluebells in the grass by his\\nfeet while storm after storm possessed his breast. They were fierce and\\nbrief because driven by his will. In those few moments of contending\\nstrife Dale was immeasurably removed from that dark gulf of self which\\nhad made his winter a nightmare. And when he stood erect again it seemed\\nthat the old earth had a stirring, electrifying impetus for his feet.\\nSomething black, bitter, melancholy, and morbid, always unreal to him,\\nhad passed away forever. The great moment had been forced upon him. He\\ndid not believe Roy Beeman's preposterous hint regarding Helen; but he\\nhad gone back or soared onward, as if by magic, to his old true self.\\n\\n\\nMounted on Dale's strongest horses, with only a light pack, an ax, and\\ntheir weapons, the two men had reached the snow line on the pass by noon\\nthat day. Tom, the tame cougar, trotted along in the rear.\\n\\nThe crust of the snow, now half thawed by the sun, would not hold\\nthe weight of a horse, though it upheld the men on foot. They walked,\\nleading the horses. Travel was not difficult until the snow began to\\ndeepen; then progress slackened materially. John had not been able to\\npick out the line of the trail, so Dale did not follow his tracks. An\\nold blaze on the trees enabled Dale to keep fairly well to the trail;\\nand at length the height of the pass was reached, where the snow was\\ndeep. Here the horses labored, plowing through foot by foot. When,\\nfinally, they sank to their flanks, they had to be dragged and goaded\\non, and helped by thick flat bunches of spruce boughs placed under their\\nhoofs. It took three hours of breaking toil to do the few hundred yards\\nof deep snow on the height of the pass. The cougar did not have great\\ndifficulty in following, though it was evident he did not like such\\ntraveling.\\n\\nThat behind them, the horses gathered heart and worked on to the edge\\nof the steep descent, where they had all they could do to hold back from\\nsliding and rolling. Fast time was made on this slope, at the bottom of\\nwhich began a dense forest with snow still deep in places and windfalls\\nhard to locate. The men here performed Herculean labors, but they got\\nthrough to a park where the snow was gone. The ground, however, soft and\\nboggy, in places was more treacherous than the snow; and the travelers\\nhad to skirt the edge of the park to a point opposite, and then go on\\nthrough the forest. When they reached bare and solid ground, just before\\ndark that night, it was high time, for the horses were ready to drop,\\nand the men likewise.\\n\\nCamp was made in an open wood. Darkness fell and the men were resting\\non bough beds, feet to the fire, with Tom curled up close by, and the\\nhorses still drooping where they had been unsaddled. Morning, however,\\ndiscovered them grazing on the long, bleached grass. John shook his head\\nwhen he looked at them.\\n\\n“You reckoned to make Pine by nightfall. How far is it  the way you'll\\ngo?”\\n\\n“Fifty mile or thereabouts,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Wal, we can't ride it on them critters.”\\n\\n“John, we'd do more than that if we had to.”\\n\\nThey were saddled and on the move before sunrise, leaving snow and bog\\nbehind. Level parks and level forests led one after another to long\\nslopes and steep descents, all growing sunnier and greener as the\\naltitude diminished. Squirrels and grouse, turkeys and deer, and less\\ntame denizens of the forest grew more abundant as the travel advanced.\\nIn this game zone, however, Dale had trouble with Tom. The cougar had to\\nbe watched and called often to keep him off of trails.\\n\\n“Tom doesn't like a long trip,” said Dale. “But I'm goin' to take him.\\nSome way or other he may come in handy.”\\n\\n“Sic him onto Beasley's gang,” replied John. “Some men are powerful\\nscared of cougars. But I never was.”\\n\\n“Nor me. Though I've had cougars give me a darn uncanny feelin'.”\\n\\nThe men talked but little. Dale led the way, with Tom trotting\\nnoiselessly beside his horse. John followed close behind. They loped the\\nhorses across parks, trotted through the forests, walked slow up\\nwhat few inclines they met, and slid down the soft, wet, pine matted\\ndescents. So they averaged from six to eight miles an hour. The horses\\nheld up well under that steady travel, and this without any rest at\\nnoon.\\n\\nDale seemed to feel himself in an emotional trance. Yet, despite this,\\nthe same old sensorial perceptions crowded thick and fast upon him,\\nstrangely sweet and vivid after the past dead months when neither sun\\nnor wind nor cloud nor scent of pine nor anything in nature could stir\\nhim. His mind, his heart, his soul seemed steeped in an intoxicating\\nwine of expectation, while his eyes and ears and nose had never been\\nkeener to register the facts of the forest land. He saw the black thing\\nfar ahead that resembled a burned stump, but he knew was a bear before\\nit vanished; he saw gray flash of deer and wolf and coyote, and the red\\nof fox, and the small, wary heads of old gobblers just sticking above\\nthe grass; and he saw deep tracks of game as well as the slow rising\\nblades of bluebells where some soft footed beast had just trod. And he\\nheard the melancholy notes of birds, the twitter of grouse, the sough of\\nthe wind, the light dropping of pine cones, the near and distant bark of\\nsquirrels, the deep gobble of a turkey close at hand and the challenge\\nfrom a rival far away, the cracking of twigs in the thickets, the murmur\\nof running water, the scream of an eagle and the shrill cry of a hawk,\\nand always the soft, dull, steady pads of the hoofs of the horses.\\n\\nThe smells, too, were the sweet, stinging ones of spring, warm and\\npleasant  the odor of the clean, fresh earth cutting its way through\\nthat thick, strong fragrance of pine, the smell of logs rotting in the\\nsun, and of fresh new grass and flowers along a brook of snow water.\\n\\n“I smell smoke,” said Dale, suddenly, as he reined in, and turned for\\ncorroboration from his companion.\\n\\nJohn sniffed the warm air.\\n\\n“Wal, you're more of an Injun than me,” he replied, shaking his head.\\n\\nThey traveled on, and presently came out upon the rim of the last slope.\\nA long league of green slanted below them, breaking up into straggling\\nlines of trees and groves that joined the cedars, and these in turn\\nstretched on and down in gray black patches to the desert, that\\nglittering and bare, with streaks of somber hue, faded in the obscurity\\nof distance.\\n\\nThe village of Pine appeared to nestle in a curve of the edge of the\\ngreat forest, and the cabins looked like tiny white dots set in green.\\n\\n“Look there,” said Dale, pointing.\\n\\nSome miles to the right a gray escarpment of rock cropped out of the\\nslope, forming a promontory; and from it a thin, pale column of smoke\\ncurled upward to be lost from sight as soon as it had no background of\\ngreen.\\n\\n“Thet's your smoke, shore enough,” replied John, thoughtfully. “Now, I\\njest wonder who's campin' there. No water near or grass for hosses.”\\n\\n“John, that point's been used for smoke signals many a time.”\\n\\n“Was jest thinkin' of thet same. Shall we ride around there an' take a\\npeek?”\\n\\n“No. But we'll remember that. If Beasley's got his deep scheme goin',\\nhe'll have Snake Anson's gang somewhere close.”\\n\\n“Roy said thet same. Wal, it's some three hours till sundown. The hosses\\nkeep up. I reckon I'm fooled, for we'll make Pine all right. But old Tom\\nthere, he's tired or lazy.”\\n\\nThe big cougar was lying down, panting, and his half shut eyes were on\\nDale.\\n\\n“Tom's only lazy an' fat. He could travel at this gait for a week. But\\nlet's rest a half hour an' watch that smoke before movin' on. We can\\nmake Pine before sundown.”\\n\\n\\nWhen travel had been resumed, half way down the slope Dale's sharp eyes\\ncaught a broad track where shod horses had passed, climbing in a long\\nslant toward the promontory. He dismounted to examine it, and John,\\ncoming up, proceeded with alacrity to get off and do likewise. Dale made\\nhis deductions, after which he stood in a brown study beside his horse,\\nwaiting for John.\\n\\n“Wal, what 'd you make of these here tracks?” asked that worthy.\\n\\n“Some horses an' a pony went along here yesterday, an' to day a single\\nhorse made, that fresh track.”\\n\\n“Wal, Milt, for a hunter you ain't so bad at hoss tracks,” observed\\nJohn, “But how many hosses went yesterday?”\\n\\n“I couldn't make out  several  maybe four or five.”\\n\\n“Six hosses an' a colt or little mustang, unshod, to be strict correct.\\nWal, supposin' they did. What 's it mean to us?”\\n\\n“I don't know as I'd thought anythin' unusual, if it hadn't been for\\nthat smoke we saw off the rim, an' then this here fresh track made along\\nto day. Looks queer to me.”\\n\\n“Wish Roy was here,” replied John, scratching his head. “Milt, I've a\\nhunch, if he was, he'd foller them tracks.”\\n\\n“Maybe. But we haven't time for that. We can backtrail them, though, if\\nthey keep clear as they are here. An' we'll not lose any time, either.”\\n\\nThat broad track led straight toward Pine, down to the edge of the\\ncedars, where, amid some jagged rocks, evidences showed that men had\\ncamped there for days. Here it ended as a broad trail. But from the\\nnorth came the single fresh track made that very day, and from the east,\\nmore in a line with Pine, came two tracks made the day before. And these\\nwere imprints of big and little hoofs. Manifestly these interested John\\nmore than they did Dale, who had to wait for his companion.\\n\\n“Milt, it ain't a colt's  thet little track,” avowed John.\\n\\n“Why not  an' what if it isn't?” queried Dale.\\n\\n“Wal, it ain't, because a colt always straggles back, an' from one\\nside to t'other. This little track keeps close to the big one. An', by\\nGeorge! it was made by a led mustang.”\\n\\nJohn resembled Roy Beeman then with that leaping, intent fire in his\\ngray eyes. Dale's reply was to spur his horse into a trot and call\\nsharply to the lagging cougar.\\n\\nWhen they turned into the broad, blossom bordered road that was the\\nonly thoroughfare of Pine the sun was setting red and gold behind the\\nmountains. The horses were too tired for any more than a walk. Natives\\nof the village, catching sight of Dale and Beeman, and the huge gray cat\\nfollowing like a dog, called excitedly to one another. A group of men\\nin front of Turner's gazed intently down the road, and soon manifested\\nsigns of excitement. Dale and his comrade dismounted in front of Widow\\nCass's cottage. And Dale called as he strode up the little path. Mrs.\\nCass came out. She was white and shaking, but appeared calm. At sight of\\nher John Beeman drew a sharp breath.\\n\\n“Wal, now  ” he began, hoarsely, and left off.\\n\\n“How's Roy?” queried Dale.\\n\\n“Lord knows I'm glad to see you, boys! Milt, you're thin an'\\nstrange lookin'. Roy's had a little setback. He got a shock to day an'\\nit throwed him off. Fever  an' now he's out of his head. It won't do\\nno good for you to waste time seein' him. Take my word for it he's\\nall right. But there's others as  For the land's sakes, Milt Dale, you\\nfetched thet cougar back! Don't let him near me!”\\n\\n“Tom won't hurt you, mother,” said Dale, as the cougar came padding up\\nthe path. “You were sayin' somethin'  about others. Is Miss Helen safe?\\nHurry!”\\n\\n“Ride up to see her  an' waste no more time here.”\\n\\nDale was quick in the saddle, followed by John, but the horses had to be\\nseverely punished to force them even to a trot. And that was a lagging\\ntrot, which now did not leave Torn behind.\\n\\nThe ride up to Auchincloss's ranch house seemed endless to Dale. Natives\\ncame out in the road to watch after he had passed. Stern as Dale was in\\ndominating his feelings, he could not wholly subordinate his mounting\\njoy to a waiting terrible anticipation of catastrophe. But no matter\\nwhat awaited  nor what fateful events might hinge upon this nameless\\ncircumstance about to be disclosed, the wonderful and glorious fact of\\nthe present was that in a moment he would see Helen Rayner.\\n\\nThere were saddled horses in the courtyard, but no riders. A Mexican\\nboy sat on the porch bench, in the seat where Dale remembered he had\\nencountered Al Auchincloss. The door of the big sitting room was open.\\nThe scent of flowers, the murmur of bees, the pounding of hoofs came\\nvaguely to Dale. His eyes dimmed, so that the ground, when he slid out\\nof his saddle, seemed far below him. He stepped upon the porch. His\\nsight suddenly cleared. A tight fullness at his throat made incoherent\\nthe words he said to the Mexican boy. But they were understood, as the\\nboy ran back around the house. Dale knocked sharply and stepped over the\\nthreshold.\\n\\nOutside, John, true to his habits, was thinking, even in that moment of\\nsuspense, about the faithful, exhausted horses. As he unsaddled them he\\ntalked: “Fer soft an' fat hosses, winterin' high up, wal, you've done\\nsomethin'!”\\n\\nThen Dale heard a voice in another room, a step, a creak of the door. It\\nopened. A woman in white appeared. He recognized Helen. But instead of\\nthe rich brown bloom and dark eyed beauty so hauntingly limned on\\nhis memory, he saw a white, beautiful face, strained and quivering in\\nanguish, and eyes that pierced his heart. He could not speak.\\n\\n“Oh! my friend  you've come!” she whispered.\\n\\nDale put out a shaking hand. But she did not see it. She clutched his\\nshoulders, as if to feel whether or not he was real, and then her arms\\nwent up round his neck.\\n\\n“Oh, thank God! I knew you would come!” she said, and her head sank to\\nhis shoulder.\\n\\nDale divined what he had suspected. Helen's sister had been carried off.\\nYet, while his quick mind grasped Helen's broken spirit  the unbalance\\nthat was reason for this marvelous and glorious act  he did not\\ntake other meaning of the embrace to himself. He just stood there,\\ntransported, charged like a tree struck by lightning, making sure with\\nall his keen senses, so that he could feel forever, how she was clinging\\nround his neck, her face over his bursting heart, her quivering form\\nclose pressed to his.\\n\\n“It's  Bo,” he said, unsteadily.\\n\\n“She went riding yesterday  and  never  came  back!” replied Helen,\\nbrokenly.\\n\\n“I've seen her trail. She's been taken into the woods. I'll find her.\\nI'll fetch her back,” he replied, rapidly.\\n\\nWith a shock she seemed to absorb his meaning. With another shock she\\nraised her face  leaned back a little to look at him.\\n\\n“You'll find her  fetch her back?”\\n\\n“Yes,” he answered, instantly.\\n\\nWith that ringing word it seemed to Dale she realized how she was\\nstanding. He felt her shake as she dropped her arms and stepped back,\\nwhile the white anguish of her face was flooded out by a wave of\\nscarlet. But she was brave in her confusion. Her eyes never fell, though\\nthey changed swiftly, darkening with shame, amaze, and with feelings he\\ncould not read.\\n\\n“I'm almost  out of my head,” she faltered.\\n\\n“No wonder. I saw that... But now you must get clear headed. I've no\\ntime to lose.”\\n\\nHe led her to the door.\\n\\n“John, it's Bo that's gone,” he called. “Since yesterday... Send the\\nboy to get me a bag of meat an' bread. You run to the corral an' get\\nme a fresh horse. My old horse Ranger if you can find him quick. An'\\nrustle.”\\n\\nWithout a word John leaped bareback on one of the horses he had just\\nunsaddled and spurred him across the courtyard.\\n\\nThen the big cougar, seeing Helen, got up from where he lay on the porch\\nand came to her.\\n\\n“Oh, it's Tom!” cried Helen, and as he rubbed against her knees she\\npatted his head with trembling hand. “You big, beautiful pet! Oh, how I\\nremember! Oh, how Bo would love to  ”\\n\\n“Where's Carmichael?” interrupted Dale. “Out huntin' Bo?”\\n\\n“Yes. It was he who missed her first. He rode everywhere yesterday. Last\\nnight when he came back he was wild. I've not seen him to day. He made\\nall the other men but Hal and Joe stay home on the ranch.”\\n\\n“Right. An' John must stay, too,” declared Dale. “But it's strange.\\nCarmichael ought to have found the girl's tracks. She was ridin' a\\npony?”\\n\\n“Bo rode Sam. He's a little bronc, very strong and fast.”\\n\\n“I come across his tracks. How'd Carmichael miss them?”\\n\\n“He didn't. He found them  trailed them all along the north range.\\nThat's where he forbade Bo to go. You see, they're in love with each\\nother. They've been at odds. Neither will give in. Bo disobeyed him.\\nThere's hard ground off the north range, so he said. He was able to\\nfollow her tracks only so far.”\\n\\n“Were there any other tracks along with hers?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Miss Helen, I found them 'way southeast of Pine up on the slope of the\\nmountain. There were seven other horses makin' that trail  when we run\\nacross it. On the way down we found a camp where men had waited. An'\\nBo's pony, led by a rider on a big horse, come into that camp from the\\neast  maybe north a little. An' that tells the story.”\\n\\n“Riggs ran her down  made off with her!” cried Helen, passionately. “Oh,\\nthe villain! He had men in waiting. That's Beasley's work. They were\\nafter me.”\\n\\n“It may not be just what you said, but that's close enough. An' Bo's\\nin a bad fix. You must face that an' try to bear up under  fears of the\\nworst.”\\n\\n“My friend! You will save her!”\\n\\n“I'll fetch her back, alive or dead.”\\n\\n“Dead! Oh, my God!” Helen cried, and closed her eyes an instant, to open\\nthem burning black. “But Bo isn't dead. I know that  I feel it. She'll\\nnot die very easy. She's a little savage. She has no fear. She'd fight\\nlike a tigress for her life. She's strong. You remember how strong. She\\ncan stand anything. Unless they murder her outright she'll live  a long\\ntime  through any ordeal... So I beg you, my friend, don't lose an\\nhour  don't ever give up!”\\n\\nDale trembled under the clasp of her hands. Loosing his own from her\\nclinging hold, he stepped out on the porch. At that moment John appeared\\non Ranger, coming at a gallop.\\n\\n“Nell, I'll never come back without her,” said Dale. “I reckon you can\\nhope  only be prepared. That's all. It's hard. But these damned deals\\nare common out here in the West.”\\n\\n“Suppose Beasley comes  here!” exclaimed Helen, and again her hand went\\nout toward him.\\n\\n“If he does, you refuse to get off,” replied Dale. “But don't let him\\nor his greasers put a dirty hand on you. Should he threaten force  why,\\npack some clothes  an' your valuables  an' go down to Mrs. Cass's. An'\\nwait till I come back!”\\n\\n“Wait  till you  come back!” she faltered, slowly turning white again.\\nHer dark eyes dilated. “Milt  you're like Las Vegas. You'll kill\\nBeasley!”\\n\\nDale heard his own laugh, very cold and strange, foreign to his ears. A\\ngrim, deadly hate of Beasley vied with the tenderness and pity he felt\\nfor this distressed girl. It was a sore trial to see her leaning there\\nagainst the door  to be compelled to leave her alone. Abruptly be\\nstalked off the porch. Tom followed him. The black horse whinnied his\\nrecognition of Dale and snorted at sight of the cougar. Just then the\\nMexican boy returned with a bag. Dale tied this, with the small pack,\\nbehind the saddle.\\n\\n“John, you stay here with Miss Helen,” said Dale. “An' if Carmichael\\ncomes back, keep him, too! An' to night, if any one rides into Pine from\\nthe way we come, you be sure to spot him.”\\n\\n“I'll do thet, Milt,” responded John.\\n\\nDale mounted, and, turning for a last word to Helen, he felt the\\nwords of cheer halted on his lips as he saw her standing white and\\nbroken hearted, with her hands to her bosom. He could not look twice.\\n\\n“Come on there, you Tom,” he called to the cougar. “Reckon on this track\\nyou'll pay me for all my trainin' of you.”\\n\\n“Oh, my friend!” came Helen's sad voice, almost a whisper to his\\nthrobbing ears. “Heaven help you  to save her! I  ”\\n\\nThen Ranger started and Dale heard no more. He could not look back. His\\neyes were full of tears and his breast ached. By a tremendous effort he\\nshifted that emotion  called on all the spiritual energy of his being to\\nthe duty of this grim task before him.\\n\\nHe did not ride down through the village, but skirted the northern\\nborder, and worked round to the south, where, coming to the trail he had\\nmade an hour past, he headed on it, straight for the slope now darkening\\nin the twilight. The big cougar showed more willingness to return on\\nthis trail than he had shown in the coming. Ranger was fresh and wanted\\nto go, but Dale held him in.\\n\\nA cool wind blew down from the mountain with the coming of night.\\nAgainst the brightening stars Dale saw the promontory lift its bold\\noutline. It was miles away. It haunted him, strangely calling. A night,\\nand perhaps a day, separated him from the gang that held Bo Rayner\\nprisoner. Dale had no plan as yet. He had only a motive as great as the\\nlove he bore Helen Rayner.\\n\\nBeasley's evil genius had planned this abduction. Riggs was a tool, a\\ncowardly knave dominated by a stronger will. Snake Anson and his gang\\nhad lain in wait at that cedar camp; had made that broad hoof track\\nleading up the mountain. Beasley had been there with them that very day.\\nAll this was as assured to Dale as if he had seen the men.\\n\\nBut the matter of Dale's recovering the girl and doing it speedily\\nstrung his mental strength to its highest pitch. Many outlines of action\\nflashed through his mind as he rode on, peering keenly through the\\nnight, listening with practised ears. All were rejected. And at the\\noutset of every new branching of thought he would gaze down at the\\ngray form of the cougar, long, graceful, heavy, as he padded beside the\\nhorse. From the first thought of returning to help Helen Rayner he had\\nconceived an undefined idea of possible value in the qualities of his\\npet. Tom had performed wonderful feats of trailing, but he had never\\nbeen tried on men. Dale believed he could make him trail anything, yet\\nhe had no proof of this. One fact stood out of all Dale's conjectures,\\nand it was that he had known men, and brave men, to fear cougars.\\n\\nFar up on the slope, in a little hollow where water ran and there was\\na little grass for Ranger to pick, Dale haltered him and made ready to\\nspend the night. He was sparing with his food, giving Tom more than he\\ntook himself. Curled close up to Dale, the big cat went to sleep.\\n\\nBut Dale lay awake for long.\\n\\nThe night was still, with only a faint moan of wind on this sheltered\\nslope. Dale saw hope in the stars. He did not seem to have promised\\nhimself or Helen that he could save her sister, and then her property.\\nHe seemed to have stated something unconsciously settled, outside of his\\nthinking. Strange how this certainty was not vague, yet irreconcilable\\nwith any plans he created! Behind it, somehow nameless with\\ninconceivable power, surged all his wonderful knowledge of forest, of\\ntrails, of scents, of night, of the nature of men lying down to sleep in\\nthe dark, lonely woods, of the nature of this great cat that lived its\\nevery action in accordance with his will.\\n\\nHe grew sleepy, and gradually his mind stilled, with his last conscious\\nthought a portent that he would awaken to accomplish his desperate task.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nYoung Burt possessed the keenest eyes of any man in Snake Anson's\\ngang, for which reason he was given the post as lookout from the lofty\\npromontory. His instructions were to keep sharp watch over the open\\nslopes below and to report any sight of a horse.\\n\\nA cedar fire with green boughs on top of dead wood sent up a long, pale\\ncolumn of smoke. This signal fire had been kept burning since sunrise.\\n\\nThe preceding night camp had been made on a level spot in the cedars\\nback of the promontory. But manifestly Anson did not expect to remain\\nthere long. For, after breakfast, the packs had been made up and the\\nhorses stood saddled and bridled. They were restless and uneasy, tossing\\nbits and fighting flies. The sun, now half way to meridian, was hot and\\nno breeze blew in that sheltered spot.\\n\\nShady Jones had ridden off early to fill the water bags, and had not yet\\nreturned. Anson, thinner and scalier and more snakelike than ever,\\nwas dealing a greasy, dirty deck of cards, his opponent being the\\nsquare shaped, black visaged Moze. In lieu of money the gamblers wagered\\nwith cedar berries, each of which berries represented a pipeful of\\ntobacco. Jim Wilson brooded under a cedar tree, his unshaven face a\\ndirty dust hue, a smoldering fire in his light eyes, a sullen set to his\\njaw. Every little while he would raise his eyes to glance at Riggs, and\\nit seemed that a quick glance was enough. Riggs paced to and fro in\\nthe open, coatless and hatless, his black broadcloth trousers and\\nembroidered vest dusty and torn. An enormous gun bumped awkwardly in\\nits sheath swinging below his hip. Riggs looked perturbed. His face was\\nsweating freely, yet it was far from red in color. He did not appear to\\nmind the sun or the flies. His eyes were staring, dark, wild, shifting\\nin gaze from everything they encountered. But often that gaze shot back\\nto the captive girl sitting under a cedar some yards from the man.\\n\\nBo Rayner's little, booted feet were tied together with one end of a\\nlasso and the other end trailed off over the ground. Her hands were\\nfree. Her riding habit was dusty and disordered. Her eyes blazed\\ndefiantly out of a small, pale face.\\n\\n“Harve Riggs, I wouldn't be standing in those cheap boots of yours for\\na million dollars,” she said, sarcastically. Riggs took no notice of her\\nwords.\\n\\n“You pack that gun sheath wrong end out. What have you got the gun for,\\nanyhow?” she added, tauntingly.\\n\\nSnake Anson let out a hoarse laugh and Moze's black visage opened in a\\nhuge grin. Jim Wilson seemed to drink in the girl's words. Sullen and\\nsomber, he bent his lean head, very still, as if listening.\\n\\n“You'd better shut up,” said Riggs, darkly.\\n\\n“I will not shut up,” declared Bo.\\n\\n“Then I'll gag you,” he threatened.\\n\\n“Gag me! Why, you dirty, low down, two bit of a bluff!” she exclaimed,\\nhotly, “I'd like to see you try it. I'll tear that long hair of yours\\nright off your head.”\\n\\nRiggs advanced toward her with his hands clutching, as if eager to\\nthrottle her. The girl leaned forward, her face reddening, her eyes\\nfierce.\\n\\n“You damned little cat!” muttered Riggs, thickly. “I'll gag you  if you\\ndon't stop squallin'.”\\n\\n“Come on. I dare you to lay a hand on me... Harve Riggs, I'm not the\\nleast afraid of you. Can't you savvy that? You're a liar, a four flush,\\na sneak! Why, you're not fit to wipe the feet of any of these outlaws.”\\n\\nRiggs took two long strides and bent over her, his teeth protruding in a\\nsnarl, and he cuffed her hard on the side of the head.\\n\\nBo's head jerked back with the force of the blow, but she uttered no\\ncry.\\n\\n“Are you goin' to keep your jaw shut?” he demanded, stridently, and a\\ndark tide of blood surged up into his neck.\\n\\n“I should smile I'm not,” retorted Bo, in cool, deliberate anger\\nof opposition. “You've roped me  and you've struck me! Now get a\\nclub  stand off there  out of my reach  and beat me! Oh, if I only knew\\ncuss words fit for you  I'd call you them!”\\n\\nSnake Anson had stopped playing cards, and was watching, listening, with\\nhalf disgusted, half amused expression on his serpent like face. Jim\\nWilson slowly rose to his feet. If any one had observed him it would\\nhave been to note that he now seemed singularly fascinated by this\\nscene, yet all the while absorbed in himself. Once he loosened the\\nneck band of his blouse.\\n\\nRiggs swung his arm more violently at the girl. But she dodged.\\n\\n“You dog!” she hissed. “Oh, if I only had a gun!”\\n\\nHer face then, with its dead whiteness and the eyes of flame, held a\\ntragic, impelling beauty that stung Anson into remonstrance.\\n\\n“Aw, Riggs, don't beat up the kid,” he protested. “Thet won't do any\\ngood. Let her alone.”\\n\\n“But she's got to shut up,” replied Riggs.\\n\\n“How 'n hell air you goin' to shet her up? Mebbe if you get out of her\\nsight she'll be quiet... How about thet, girl?”\\n\\nAnson gnawed his drooping mustache as he eyed Bo.\\n\\n“Have I made any kick to you or your men yet?” she queried.\\n\\n“It strikes me you 'ain't,” replied Anson.\\n\\n“You won't hear me make any so long as I'm treated decent,” said Bo.\\n“I don't know what you've got to do with Riggs. He ran me down  roped\\nme  dragged me to your camp. Now I've a hunch you're waiting for\\nBeasley.”\\n\\n“Girl, your hunch 's correct,” said Anson.\\n\\n“Well, do you know I'm the wrong girl?”\\n\\n“What's thet? I reckon you're Nell Rayner, who got left all old\\nAuchincloss's property.”\\n\\n“No. I'm Bo Rayner. Nell is my sister. She owns the ranch. Beasley\\nwanted her.”\\n\\nAnson cursed deep and low. Under his sharp, bristling eyebrows he bent\\ncunning green eyes upon Riggs.\\n\\n“Say, you! Is what this kid says so?”\\n\\n“Yes. She's Nell Rayner's sister,” replied Riggs, doggedly.\\n\\n“A huh! Wal, why in the hell did you drag her into my camp an' off up\\nhere to signal Beasley? He ain't wantin' her. He wants the girl who owns\\nthe ranch. Did you take one fer the other  same as thet day we was with\\nyou?”\\n\\n“Guess I must have,” replied Riggs, sullenly.\\n\\n“But you knowed her from her sister afore you come to my camp?”\\n\\nRiggs shook his head. He was paler now and sweating more freely. The\\ndank hair hung wet over his forehead. His manner was that of a man\\nsuddenly realizing he had gotten into a tight place.\\n\\n“Oh, he's a liar!” exclaimed Bo, with contemptuous ring in her voice.\\n“He comes from my country. He has known Nell and me for years.”\\n\\nSnake Anson turned to look at Wilson.\\n\\n“Jim, now hyar's a queer deal this feller has rung in on us. I thought\\nthet kid was pretty young. Don't you remember Beasley told us Nell\\nRayner was a handsome woman?”\\n\\n“Wal, pard Anson, if this heah gurl ain't handsome my eyes have gone\\npore,” drawled Wilson.\\n\\n“A huh! So your Texas chilvaree over the ladies is some operatin',”\\n retorted Anson, with fine sarcasm. “But thet ain't tellin' me what you\\nthink?”\\n\\n“Wal, I ain't tellin' you what I think yet. But I know thet kid ain't\\nNell Rayner. For I've seen her.”\\n\\nAnson studied his right hand man for a moment, then, taking out his\\ntobacco pouch, he sat himself down upon a stone and proceeded leisurely\\nto roll a cigarette. He put it between his thin lips and apparently\\nforgot to light it. For a few moments he gazed at the yellow ground and\\nsome scant sage brush. Riggs took to pacing up and down. Wilson leaned\\nas before against the cedar. The girl slowly recovered from her excess\\nof anger.\\n\\n“Kid, see hyar,” said Anson, addressing the girl; “if Riggs knowed you\\nwasn't Nell an' fetched you along anyhow  what 'd he do thet fur?”\\n\\n“He chased me  caught me. Then he saw some one after us and he hurried\\nto your camp. He was afraid  the cur!”\\n\\nRiggs heard her reply, for he turned a malignant glance upon her.\\n\\n“Anson, I fetched her because I know Nell Rayner will give up anythin'\\non earth for her,” he said, in loud voice.\\n\\nAnson pondered this statement with an air of considering its apparent\\nsincerity.\\n\\n“Don't you believe him,” declared Bo Rayner, bluntly. “He's a liar. He's\\ndouble crossing Beasley and all of you.”\\n\\nRiggs raised a shaking hand to clench it at her. “Keep still or it 'll\\nbe the worse for you.”\\n\\n“Riggs, shut up yourself,” put in Anson, as he leisurely rose. “Mebbe it\\n'ain't occurred to you thet she might have some talk interestin' to me.\\nAn' I'm runnin' this hyar camp. ... Now, kid, talk up an' say what you\\nlike.”\\n\\n“I said he was double crossing you all,” replied the girl, instantly.\\n“Why, I'm surprised you'd be caught in his company! My uncle Al and\\nmy sweetheart Carmichael and my friend Dale  they've all told me what\\nWestern men are, even down to outlaws, robbers, cutthroat rascals like\\nyou. And I know the West well enough now to be sure that four flush\\ndoesn't belong here and can't last here. He went to Dodge City once\\nand when he came back he made a bluff at being a bad man. He was a\\nswaggering, bragging, drinking gun fighter. He talked of the men he'd\\nshot, of the fights he'd had. He dressed like some of those gun throwing\\ngamblers... He was in love with my sister Nell. She hated him. He\\nfollowed us out West and he has hung on our actions like a sneaking\\nIndian. Why, Nell and I couldn't even walk to the store in the village.\\nHe rode after me out on the range  chased me... For that Carmichael\\ncalled Riggs's bluff down in Turner's saloon. Dared him to draw! Cussed\\nhim every name on the range! Slapped and beat and kicked him! Drove him\\nout of Pine!... And now, whatever he has said to Beasley or you, it's a\\ndead sure bet he's playing his own game. That's to get hold of Nell, and\\nif not her  then me!... Oh, I'm out of breath  and I'm out of names to\\ncall him. If I talked forever  I'd never be  able to  do him justice.\\nBut lend me  a gun  a minute!”\\n\\nJim Wilson's quiet form vibrated with a start. Anson with his admiring\\nsmile pulled his gun and, taking a couple of steps forward, held it out\\nbutt first. She stretched eagerly for it and he jerked it away.\\n\\n“Hold on there!” yelled Riggs, in alarm.\\n\\n“Damme, Jim, if she didn't mean bizness!” exclaimed the outlaw.\\n\\n“Wal, now  see heah, Miss. Would you bore him  if you hed a gun?”\\n inquired Wilson, with curious interest. There was more of respect in his\\ndemeanor than admiration.\\n\\n“No. I don't want his cowardly blood on my hands,” replied the girl.\\n“But I'd make him dance  I'd make him run.”\\n\\n“Shore you can handle a gun?”\\n\\nShe nodded her answer while her eyes flashed hate and her resolute lips\\ntwitched.\\n\\nThen Wilson made a singularly swift motion and his gun was pitched butt\\nfirst to within a foot of her hand. She snatched it up, cocked it, aimed\\nit, all before Anson could move. But he yelled:\\n\\n“Drop thet gun, you little devil!”\\n\\nRiggs turned ghastly as the big blue gun lined on him. He also yelled,\\nbut that yell was different from Anson's.\\n\\n“Run or dance!” cried the girl.\\n\\nThe big gun boomed and leaped almost out of her hand. She took both\\nhands, and called derisively as she fired again. The second bullet hit\\nat Riggs's feet, scattering the dust and fragments of stone all over\\nhim. He bounded here  there  then darted for the rocks. A third time the\\nheavy gun spoke and this bullet must have ticked Riggs, for he let out a\\nhoarse bawl and leaped sheer for the protection of a rock.\\n\\n“Plug him! Shoot off a leg!” yelled Snake Anson, whooping and stamping,\\nas Riggs got out of sight.\\n\\nJim Wilson watched the whole performance with the same quietness\\nthat had characterized his manner toward the girl. Then, as Riggs\\ndisappeared, Wilson stepped forward and took the gun from the girl's\\ntrembling hands. She was whiter than ever, but still resolute and\\ndefiant. Wilson took a glance over in the direction Riggs had hidden and\\nthen proceeded to reload the gun. Snake Anson's roar of laughter ceased\\nrather suddenly.\\n\\n“Hyar, Jim, she might have held up the whole gang with thet gun,” he\\nprotested.\\n\\n“I reckon she 'ain't nothin' ag'in' us,” replied Wilson.\\n\\n“A huh! You know a lot about wimmen now, don't you? But thet did my\\nheart good. Jim, what 'n earth would you have did if thet 'd been you\\ninstead of Riggs?”\\n\\nThe query seemed important and amazing. Wilson pondered.\\n\\n“Shore I'd stood there  stock still  an' never moved an eye winker.”\\n\\n“An' let her shoot!” ejaculated Anson, nodding his long head. “Me, too!”\\n\\nSo these rough outlaws, inured to all the violence and baseness of their\\ndishonest calling, rose to the challenging courage of a slip of a girl.\\nShe had the one thing they respected  nerve.\\n\\nJust then a halloo, from the promontory brought Anson up with a start.\\nMuttering to himself, he strode out toward the jagged rocks that hid the\\noutlook. Moze shuffled his burly form after Anson.\\n\\n“Miss, it shore was grand  thet performance of Mister Gunman Riggs,”\\n remarked Jim Wilson, attentively studying the girl.\\n\\n“Much obliged to you for lending me your gun,” she replied. “I  I hope I\\nhit him  a little.”\\n\\n“Wal, if you didn't sting him, then Jim Wilson knows nothin' about\\nlead.”\\n\\n“Jim Wilson? Are you the man  the outlaw my uncle Al knew?”\\n\\n“Reckon I am, miss. Fer I knowed Al shore enough. What 'd he say aboot\\nme?”\\n\\n“I remember once he was telling me about Snake Anson's gang. He\\nmentioned you. Said you were a real gun fighter. And what a shame it was\\nyou had to be an outlaw.”\\n\\n“Wal! An' so old Al spoke thet nice of me... It's tolerable likely I'll\\nremember. An' now, miss, can I do anythin' for you?”\\n\\nSwift as a flash she looked at him.\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“Wal, shore I don't mean much, I'm sorry to say. Nothin' to make\\nyou look like thet... I hev to be an outlaw, shore as you're born.\\nBut  mebbe there's a difference in outlaws.”\\n\\nShe understood him and paid him the compliment not to voice her sudden\\nupflashing hope that he might be one to betray his leader.\\n\\n“Please take this rope off my feet. Let me walk a little. Let me have\\na  a little privacy. That fool watched every move I made. I promise not\\nto run away. And, oh! I'm thirsty.”\\n\\n“Shore you've got sense.” He freed her feet and helped her get up.\\n“There'll be some fresh water any minit now, if you'll wait.”\\n\\nThen he turned his back and walked over to where Riggs sat nursing a\\nbullet burn on his leg.\\n\\n“Say, Riggs, I'm takin' the responsibility of loosin' the girl for a\\nlittle spell. She can't get away. An' there ain't any sense in bein'\\nmean.”\\n\\nRiggs made no reply, and went on rolling down his trousers leg, lapped\\na fold over at the bottom and pulled on his boot. Then he strode out\\ntoward the promontory. Half way there he encountered Anson tramping\\nback.\\n\\n“Beasley's comin' one way an' Shady's comin' another. We'll be off this\\nhot point of rock by noon,” said the outlaw leader.\\n\\nRiggs went on to the promontory to look for himself.\\n\\n“Where's the girl?” demanded Anson, in surprise, when he got back to the\\ncamp.\\n\\n“Wal, she's walkin' 'round between heah an' Pine,” drawled Wilson.\\n\\n“Jim, you let her loose?”\\n\\n“Shore I did. She's been hawg tied all the time. An' she said she'd not\\nrun off. I'd take thet girl's word even to a sheep thief.”\\n\\n“A huh. So would I, for all of thet. But, Jim, somethin's workin' in\\nyou. Ain't you sort of rememberin' a time when you was young  an' mebbe\\nknowed pretty kids like this one?”\\n\\n“Wal, if I am it 'll shore turn out bad fer somebody.”\\n\\nAnson gave him a surprised stare and suddenly lost the bantering tone.\\n\\n“A huh! So thet's how it's workin',” he replied, and flung himself down\\nin the shade.\\n\\nYoung Burt made his appearance then, wiping his sallow face. His\\ndeep set, hungry eyes, upon which his comrades set such store, roved\\naround the camp.\\n\\n“Whar's the gurl?” he queried.\\n\\n“Jim let her go out fer a stroll,” replied Anson.\\n\\n“I seen Jim was gittin' softy over her. Haw! Haw! Haw!”\\n\\nBut Snake Anson did not crack a smile. The atmosphere appeared not to be\\ncongenial for jokes, a fact Burt rather suddenly divined. Riggs and Moze\\nreturned from the promontory, the latter reporting that Shady Jones was\\nriding up close. Then the girl walked slowly into sight and approached\\nto find a seat within ten yards of the group. They waited in silence\\nuntil the expected horseman rode up with water bottles slung on both\\nsides of his saddle. His advent was welcome. All the men were thirsty.\\nWilson took water to the girl before drinking himself.\\n\\n“Thet's an all fired hot ride fer water,” declared the outlaw Shady, who\\nsomehow fitted his name in color and impression. “An', boss, if it's the\\nsame to you I won't take it ag'in.”\\n\\n“Cheer up, Shady. We'll be rustlin' back in the mountains before\\nsundown,” said Anson.\\n\\n“Hang me if that ain't the cheerfulest news I've hed in some days. Hey,\\nMoze?”\\n\\nThe black faced Moze nodded his shaggy head.\\n\\n“I'm sick an' sore of this deal,” broke out Burt, evidently encouraged\\nby his elders. “Ever since last fall we've been hangin' 'round  till\\njest lately freezin' in camps  no money  no drink  no grub wuth havin'.\\nAll on promises!”\\n\\nNot improbably this young and reckless member of the gang had struck\\nthe note of discord. Wilson seemed most detached from any sentiment\\nprevailing there. Some strong thoughts were revolving in his brain.\\n\\n“Burt, you ain't insinuatin' thet I made promises?” inquired Anson,\\nominously.\\n\\n“No, boss, I ain't. You allus said we might hit it rich. But them\\npromises was made to you. An' it 'd be jest like thet greaser to go back\\non his word now we got the gurl.”\\n\\n“Son, it happens we got the wrong one. Our long haired pard hyar  Mister\\nRiggs  him with the big gun  he waltzes up with this sassy kid instead\\nof the woman Beasley wanted.”\\n\\nBurt snorted his disgust while Shady Jones, roundly swearing, pelted\\nthe smoldering camp fire with stones. Then they all lapsed into surly\\nsilence. The object of their growing scorn, Riggs, sat a little\\nway apart, facing none of them, but maintaining as bold a front as\\napparently he could muster.\\n\\nPresently a horse shot up his ears, the first indication of scent or\\nsound imperceptible to the men. But with this cue they all, except\\nWilson, sat up attentively. Soon the crack of iron shod hoofs on stone\\nbroke the silence. Riggs nervously rose to his feet. And the others,\\nstill excepting Wilson, one by one followed suit. In another moment a\\nrangy bay horse trotted out of the cedars, up to the camp, and his rider\\njumped off nimbly for so heavy a man.\\n\\n“Howdy, Beasley?” was Anson's greeting.\\n\\n“Hello, Snake, old man!” replied Beasley, as his bold, snapping black\\neyes swept the group. He was dusty and hot, and wet with sweat, yet\\nevidently too excited to feel discomfort. “I seen your smoke signal\\nfirst off an' jumped my hoss quick. But I rode north of Pine before I\\nheaded 'round this way. Did you corral the girl or did Riggs? Say!  you\\nlook queer!... What's wrong here? You haven't signaled me for nothin'?”\\n\\nSnake Anson beckoned to Bo.\\n\\n“Come out of the shade. Let him look you over.”\\n\\nThe girl walked out from under the spreading cedar that had hidden her\\nfrom sight.\\n\\nBeasley stared aghast  his jaw dropped.\\n\\n“Thet's the kid sister of the woman I wanted!” he ejaculated.\\n\\n“So we've jest been told.”\\n\\nAstonishment still held Beasley.\\n\\n“Told?” he echoed. Suddenly his big body leaped with a start. “Who got\\nher? Who fetched her?”\\n\\n“Why, Mister Gunman Riggs hyar,” replied Anson, with a subtle scorn.\\n\\n“Riggs, you got the wrong girl,” shouted Beasley. “You made thet mistake\\nonce before. What're you up to?”\\n\\n“I chased her an' when I got her, seein' it wasn't Nell Rayner  why  I\\nkept her, anyhow,” replied Riggs. “An' I've got a word for your ear\\nalone.”\\n\\n“Man, you're crazy  queerin' my deal thet way!” roared Beasley. “You\\nheard my plans... Riggs, this girl stealin' can't be done twice. Was\\nyou drinkin' or locoed or what?”\\n\\n“Beasley, he was giving you the double cross,” cut in Bo Rayner's cool\\nvoice.\\n\\nThe rancher stared speechlessly at her, then at Anson, then at Wilson,\\nand last at Riggs, when his brown visage shaded dark with rush of purple\\nblood. With one lunge he knocked Riggs flat, then stood over him with a\\nconvulsive hand at his gun.\\n\\n“You white livered card sharp! I've a notion to bore you... They told\\nme you had a deal of your own, an' now I believe it.”\\n\\n“Yes  I had,” replied Riggs, cautiously getting up. He was ghastly. “But\\nI wasn't double crossin' you. Your deal was to get the girl away from\\nhome so you could take possession of her property. An' I wanted her.”\\n\\n“What for did you fetch the sister, then?” demanded Beasley, his big jaw\\nbulging.\\n\\n“Because I've a plan to  ”\\n\\n“Plan hell! You've spoiled my plan an' I've seen about enough of you.”\\n Beasley breathed hard; his lowering gaze boded an uncertain will toward\\nthe man who had crossed him; his hand still hung low and clutching.\\n\\n“Beasley, tell them to get my horse. I want to go home,” said Bo Rayner.\\n\\nSlowly Beasley turned. Her words enjoined a silence. What to do with her\\nnow appeared a problem.\\n\\n“I had nothin' to do with fetchin' you here an' I'll have nothin' to do\\nwith sendin' you back or whatever's done with you,” declared Beasley.\\n\\nThen the girl's face flashed white again and her eyes changed to fire.\\n\\n“You're as big a liar as Riggs,” she cried, passionately. “And you're\\na thief, a bully who picks on defenseless girls. Oh, we know your game!\\nMilt Dale heard your plot with this outlaw Anson to steal my sister. You\\nought to be hanged  you half breed greaser!”\\n\\n“I'll cut out your tongue!” hissed Beasley.\\n\\n“Yes, I'll bet you would if you had me alone. But these outlaws  these\\nsheep thieves  these tools you hire are better than you and Riggs...\\nWhat do you suppose Carmichael will do to you? Carmichael! He's my\\nsweetheart  that cowboy. You know what he did to Riggs. Have you brains\\nenough to know what he'll do to you?”\\n\\n“He'll not do much,” growled Beasley. But the thick purplish blood was\\nreceding from his face. “Your cowpuncher  ”\\n\\n“Bah!” she interrupted, and she snapped her fingers in his face. “He's\\nfrom Texas! He's from TEXAS!”\\n\\n“Supposin' he is from Texas?” demanded Beasley, in angry irritation.\\n“What's thet? Texans are all over. There's Jim Wilson, Snake Anson's\\nright hand man. He's from Texas. But thet ain't scarin' any one.”\\n\\nHe pointed toward Wilson, who shifted uneasily from foot to foot. The\\ngirl's flaming glance followed his hand.\\n\\n“Are you from Texas?” she asked.\\n\\n“Yes, Miss, I am  an' I reckon I don't deserve it,” replied Wilson. It\\nwas certain that a vague shame attended his confession.\\n\\n“Oh! I believed even a bandit from Texas would fight for a helpless\\ngirl!” she replied, in withering scorn of disappointment.\\n\\nJim Wilson dropped his head. If any one there suspected a serious\\nturn to Wilson's attitude toward that situation it was the keen outlaw\\nleader.\\n\\n“Beasley, you're courtin' death,” he broke in.\\n\\n“You bet you are!” added Bo, with a passion that made her listeners\\nquiver. “You've put me at the mercy of a gang of outlaws! You may force\\nmy sister out of her home! But your day will come.' Tom Carmichael will\\nKILL you.”\\n\\nBeasley mounted his horse. Sullen, livid, furious, he sat shaking in the\\nsaddle, to glare down at the outlaw leader.\\n\\n“Snake, thet's no fault of mine the deal's miscarried. I was square. I\\nmade my offer for the workin' out of my plan. It 'ain't been done. Now\\nthere's hell to pay an' I'm through.”\\n\\n“Beasley, I reckon I couldn't hold you to anythin',” replied Anson,\\nslowly. “But if you was square you ain't square now. We've hung around\\nan' tried hard. My men are all sore. An' we're broke, with no outfit to\\nspeak of. Me an' you never fell out before. But I reckon we might.”\\n\\n“Do I owe you any money  accordin' to the deal?” demanded Beasley.\\n\\n“No, you don't,” responded Anson, sharply.\\n\\n“Then thet's square. I wash my hands of the whole deal. Make Riggs pay\\nup. He's got money an' he's got plans. Go in with him.”\\n\\nWith that Beasley spurred his horse, wheeled and rode away. The outlaws\\ngazed after him until he disappeared in the cedars.\\n\\n“What'd you expect from a greaser?” queried Shady Jones.\\n\\n“Anson, didn't I say so?” added Burt.\\n\\nThe black visaged Moze rolled his eyes like a mad bull and Jim Wilson\\nstudiously examined a stick he held in his hands. Riggs showed immense\\nrelief.\\n\\n“Anson, stake me to some of your outfit an' I'll ride off with the\\ngirl,” he said, eagerly.\\n\\n“Where'd you go now?” queried Anson, curiously.\\n\\nRiggs appeared at a loss for a quick answer; his wits were no more equal\\nto this predicament than his nerve.\\n\\n“You're no woodsman. An' onless you're plumb locoed you'd never risk\\ngoin' near Pine or Show Down. There'll be real trackers huntin' your\\ntrail.”\\n\\nThe listening girl suddenly appealed to Wilson.\\n\\n“Don't let him take me off  alone  in the woods!” she faltered. That was\\nthe first indication of her weakening.\\n\\nJim Wilson broke into gruff reply. “I'm not bossin' this gang.”\\n\\n“But you're a man!” she importuned.\\n\\n“Riggs, you fetch along your precious firebrand an' come with us,” said\\nAnson, craftily. “I'm particular curious to see her brand you.”\\n\\n“Snake, lemme take the girl back to Pine,” said Jim Wilson.\\n\\nAnson swore his amaze.\\n\\n“It's sense,” continued Wilson. “We've shore got our own troubles, an'\\nkeepin' her 'll only add to them. I've a hunch. Now you know I ain't\\noften givin' to buckin' your say so. But this deal ain't tastin' good to\\nme. Thet girl ought to be sent home.”\\n\\n“But mebbe there's somethin' in it for us. Her sister 'd pay to git her\\nback.”\\n\\n“Wal, I shore hope you'll recollect I offered  thet's all,” concluded\\nWilson.\\n\\n“Jim, if we wanted to git rid of her we'd let Riggs take her off,”\\n remonstrated the outlaw leader. He was perturbed and undecided. Wilson\\nworried him.\\n\\nThe long Texan veered around full faced. What subtle transformation in\\nhim!\\n\\n“Like hell we would!” he said.\\n\\nIt could not have been the tone that caused Anson to quail. He might\\nhave been leader here, but he was not the greater man. His face clouded.\\n\\n“Break camp,” he ordered.\\n\\nRiggs had probably not heard that last exchange between Anson and\\nWilson, for he had walked a few rods aside to get his horse.\\n\\nIn a few moments when they started off, Burt, Jones, and Moze were in\\nthe lead driving the pack horses, Anson rode next, the girl came between\\nhim and Riggs, and significantly, it seemed, Jim Wilson brought up the\\nrear.\\n\\nThis start was made a little after the noon hour. They zigzagged up the\\nslope, took to a deep ravine, and followed it up to where it headed in\\nthe level forest. From there travel was rapid, the pack horses being\\ndriven at a jogtrot. Once when a troop of deer burst out of a thicket\\ninto a glade, to stand with ears high, young Burt halted the cavalcade.\\nHis well aimed shot brought down a deer. Then the men rode on, leaving\\nhim behind to dress and pack the meat. The only other halt made was at\\nthe crossing of the first water, a clear, swift brook, where both horses\\nand men drank thirstily. Here Burt caught up with his comrades.\\n\\nThey traversed glade and park, and wended a crooked trail through the\\ndeepening forest, and climbed, bench after bench, to higher ground,\\nwhile the sun sloped to the westward, lower and redder. Sunset had gone,\\nand twilight was momentarily brightening to the afterglow when Anson,\\nbreaking his silence of the afternoon, ordered a halt.\\n\\nThe place was wild, dismal, a shallow vale between dark slopes of\\nspruce. Grass, fire wood, and water were there in abundance. All the\\nmen were off, throwing saddles and packs, before the tired girl made an\\neffort to get down. Riggs, observing her, made a not ungentle move to\\npull her off. She gave him a sounding slap with her gloved hand.\\n\\n“Keep your paws to yourself,” she said. No evidence of exhaustion was\\nthere in her spirit.\\n\\nWilson had observed this by play, but Anson had not.\\n\\n“What come off?” he asked.\\n\\n“Wal, the Honorable Gunman Riggs jest got caressed by the lady  as he\\nwas doin' the elegant,” replied Moze, who stood nearest.\\n\\n“Jim, was you watchin'?” queried Anson. His curiosity had held through\\nthe afternoon.\\n\\n“He tried to yank her off an' she biffed him,” replied Wilson.\\n\\n“That Riggs is jest daffy or plain locoed,” said Snake, in an aside to\\nMoze.\\n\\n“Boss, you mean plain cussed. Mark my words, he'll hoodoo this outfit.\\nJim was figgerin' correct.”\\n\\n“Hoodoo  ” cursed Anson, under his breath.\\n\\nMany hands made quick work. In a few moments a fire was burning\\nbrightly, water was boiling, pots were steaming, the odor of venison\\npermeated the cool air. The girl had at last slipped off her saddle to\\nthe ground, where she sat while Riggs led the horse away. She sat there\\napparently forgotten, a pathetic droop to her head.\\n\\nWilson had taken an ax and was vigorously wielding it among the spruces.\\nOne by one they fell with swish and soft crash. Then the sliding ring\\nof the ax told how he was slicing off the branches with long sweeps.\\nPresently he appeared in the semi darkness, dragging half trimmed\\nspruces behind him. He made several trips, the last of which was to\\nstagger under a huge burden of spruce boughs. These he spread under a\\nlow, projecting branch of an aspen. Then he leaned the bushy spruces\\nslantingly against this branch on both sides, quickly improvising a\\nV shaped shelter with narrow aperture in front. Next from one of\\nthe packs he took a blanket and threw that inside the shelter. Then,\\ntouching the girl on the shoulder, he whispered:\\n\\n“When you're ready, slip in there. An' don't lose no sleep by worryin',\\nfer I'll be layin' right here.”\\n\\nHe made a motion to indicate his length across the front of the narrow\\naperture.\\n\\n“Oh, thank you! Maybe you really are a Texan,” she whispered back.\\n\\n“Mebbe,” was his gloomy reply.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nThe girl refused to take food proffered her by Riggs, but she ate and\\ndrank a little that Wilson brought her, then she disappeared in the\\nspruce lean to.\\n\\nWhatever loquacity and companionship had previously existed in\\nSnake Anson's gang were not manifest in this camp. Each man seemed\\npreoccupied, as if pondering the dawn in his mind of an ill omen not\\nclear to him yet and not yet dreamed of by his fellows. They all smoked.\\nThen Moze and Shady played cards awhile by the light of the fire, but it\\nwas a dull game, in which either seldom spoke. Riggs sought his blanket\\nfirst, and the fact was significant that he lay down some distance from\\nthe spruce shelter which contained Bo Rayner. Presently young Burt went\\noff grumbling to his bed. And not long afterward the card players did\\nlikewise.\\n\\nSnake Anson and Jim Wilson were left brooding in silence beside the\\ndying camp fire.\\n\\nThe night was dark, with only a few stars showing. A fitful wind moaned\\nunearthly through the spruce. An occasional thump of hoof sounded from\\nthe dark woods. No cry of wolf or coyote or cat gave reality to the\\nwildness of forest land.\\n\\nBy and by those men who had rolled in their blankets were breathing deep\\nand slow in heavy slumber.\\n\\n“Jim, I take it this hyar Riggs has queered our deal,” said Snake Anson,\\nin low voice.\\n\\n“I reckon,” replied Wilson.\\n\\n“An' I'm feared he's queered this hyar White Mountain country fer us.”\\n\\n“Shore I 'ain't got so far as thet. What d' ye mean, Snake?”\\n\\n“Damme if I savvy,” was the gloomy reply. “I only know what was bad\\nlooks growin' wuss. Last fall  an' winter  an' now it's near April.\\nWe've got no outfit to make a long stand in the woods... Jim, jest how\\nstrong is thet Beasley down in the settlements?”\\n\\n“I've a hunch he ain't half as strong as he bluffs.”\\n\\n“Me, too. I got thet idee yesterday. He was scared of the kid  when she\\nfired up an' sent thet hot shot about her cowboy sweetheart killin' him.\\nHe'll do it, Jim. I seen that Carmichael at Magdalena some years ago.\\nThen he was only a youngster. But, whew! Mebbe he wasn't bad after\\ntoyin' with a little red liquor.”\\n\\n“Shore. He was from Texas, she said.”\\n\\n“Jim, I savvied your feelin's was hurt  by thet talk about Texas  an'\\nwhen she up an' asked you.”\\n\\nWilson had no rejoinder for this remark.\\n\\n“Wal, Lord knows, I ain't wonderin'. You wasn't a hunted outlaw all\\nyour life. An' neither was I... Wilson, I never was keen on this girl\\ndeal  now, was I?”\\n\\n“I reckon it's honest to say no to thet,” replied Wilson. “But it's\\ndone. Beasley 'll get plugged sooner or later. Thet won't help us any.\\nChasin' sheep herders out of the country an' stealin' sheep  thet ain't\\nstealin' gurls by a long sight. Beasley 'll blame that on us, an' be\\ngreaser enough to send some of his men out to hunt us. For Pine an' Show\\nDown won't stand thet long. There's them Mormons. They'll be hell when\\nthey wake up. Suppose Carmichael got thet hunter Dale an' them hawk eyed\\nBeemans on our trail?”\\n\\n“Wal, we'd cash in  quick,” replied Anson, gruffly.\\n\\n“Then why didn't you let me take the gurl back home?”\\n\\n“Wal, come to think of thet, Jim, I'm sore, an' I need money  an' I\\nknowed you'd never take a dollar from her sister. An' I've made up my\\nmind to git somethin' out of her.”\\n\\n“Snake, you're no fool. How 'll you do thet same an' do it quick?”\\n\\n“'Ain't reckoned it out yet.”\\n\\n“Wal, you got aboot to morrer an' thet's all,” returned Wilson,\\ngloomily.\\n\\n“Jim, what's ailin' you?”\\n\\n“I'll let you figger thet out.”\\n\\n“Wal, somethin' ails the whole gang,” declared Anson, savagely.\\n“With them it's nothin' to eat  no whisky  no money to bet with  no\\ntobacco!... But thet's not what's ailin' you, Jim Wilson, nor me!”\\n\\n“Wal, what is, then?” queried Wilson.\\n\\n“With me it's a strange feelin' thet my day's over on these ranges. I\\ncan't explain, but it jest feels so. Somethin' in the air. I don't like\\nthem dark shadows out there under the spruces. Savvy?... An' as fer you,\\nJim  wal, you allus was half decent, an' my gang's got too lowdown fer\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Snake, did I ever fail you?”\\n\\n“No, you never did. You're the best pard I ever knowed. In the years\\nwe've rustled together we never had a contrary word till I let Beasley\\nfill my ears with his promises. Thet's my fault. But, Jim, it's too\\nlate.”\\n\\n“It mightn't have been too late yesterday.”\\n\\n“Mebbe not. But it is now, an' I'll hang on to the girl or git her worth\\nin gold,” declared the outlaw, grimly.\\n\\n“Snake, I've seen stronger gangs than yours come an' go. Them Big Bend\\ngangs in my country  them rustlers  they were all bad men. You have no\\nlikes of them gangs out heah. If they didn't get wiped out by Rangers\\nor cowboys, why they jest naturally wiped out themselves. Thet's a law I\\nrecognize in relation to gangs like them. An' as for yours  why, Anson,\\nit wouldn't hold water against one real gun slinger.”\\n\\n“A huh' Then if we ran up ag'in' Carmichael or some such fellar  would\\nyou be suckin' your finger like a baby?”\\n\\n“Wal, I wasn't takin' count of myself. I was takin' generalities.”\\n\\n“Aw, what 'n hell are them?” asked Anson, disgustedly. “Jim, I know as\\nwell as you thet this hyar gang is hard put. We're goin' to be trailed\\nan' chased. We've got to hide  be on the go all the time  here an'\\nthere  all over, in the roughest woods. An' wait our chance to work\\nsouth.”\\n\\n“Shore. But, Snake, you ain't takin' no count of the feelin's of the\\nmen  an' of mine an' yours... I'll bet you my hoss thet in a day or so\\nthis gang will go to pieces.”\\n\\n“I'm feared you spoke what's been crowdin' to git in my mind,” replied\\nAnson. Then he threw up his hands in a strange gesture of resignation.\\nThe outlaw was brave, but all men of the wilds recognized a force\\nstronger than themselves. He sat there resembling a brooding snake with\\nbasilisk eyes upon the fire. At length he arose, and without another\\nword to his comrade he walked wearily to where lay the dark, quiet forms\\nof the sleepers.\\n\\nJim Wilson remained beside the flickering fire. He was reading something\\nin the red embers, perhaps the past. Shadows were on his face, not all\\nfrom the fading flames or the towering spruces. Ever and anon he raised\\nhis head to listen, not apparently that he expected any unusual sound,\\nbut as if involuntarily. Indeed, as Anson had said, there was something\\nnameless in the air. The black forest breathed heavily, in fitful moans\\nof wind. It had its secrets. The glances Wilson threw on all sides\\nbetrayed that any hunted man did not love the dark night, though it hid\\nhim. Wilson seemed fascinated by the life inclosed there by the black\\ncircle of spruce. He might have been reflecting on the strange reaction\\nhappening to every man in that group, since a girl had been brought\\namong them. Nothing was clear, however; the forest kept its secret, as\\ndid the melancholy wind; the outlaws were sleeping like tired beasts,\\nwith their dark secrets locked in their hearts.\\n\\nAfter a while Wilson put some sticks on the red embers, then pulled the\\nend of a log over them. A blaze sputtered up, changing the dark circle\\nand showing the sleepers with their set, shadowed faces upturned. Wilson\\ngazed on all of them, a sardonic smile on his lips, and then his look\\nfixed upon the sleeper apart from the others  Riggs. It might have been\\nthe false light of flame and shadow that created Wilson's expression of\\ndark and terrible hate. Or it might have been the truth, expressed\\nin that lonely, unguarded hour, from the depths of a man born in the\\nSouth  a man who by his inheritance of race had reverence for all\\nwomanhood  by whose strange, wild, outlawed bloody life of a gun fighter\\nhe must hate with the deadliest hate this type that aped and mocked his\\nfame.\\n\\nIt was a long gaze Wilson rested upon Riggs  as strange and secretive as\\nthe forest wind moaning down the great aisles  and when that dark gaze\\nwas withdrawn Wilson stalked away to make his bed with the stride of one\\nill whom spirit had liberated force.\\n\\nHe laid his saddle in front of the spruce shelter where the girl had\\nentered, and his tarpaulin and blankets likewise and then wearily\\nstretched his long length to rest.\\n\\nThe camp fire blazed up, showing the exquisite green and brown flecked\\nfestooning of the spruce branches, symmetrical and perfect, yet so\\nirregular, and then it burned out and died down, leaving all in the dim\\ngray starlight. The horses were not moving around; the moan of night\\nwind had grown fainter; the low hum of insects was dying away; even\\nthe tinkle of the brook had diminished. And that growth toward absolute\\nsilence continued, yet absolute silence was never attained. Life abided\\nin the forest; only it had changed its form for the dark hours.\\n\\n\\nAnson's gang did not bestir themselves at the usual early sunrise hour\\ncommon to all woodsmen, hunters, or outlaws, to whom the break of day\\nwas welcome. These companions  Anson and Riggs included  might have\\nhated to see the dawn come. It meant only another meager meal, then\\nthe weary packing and the long, long ride to nowhere in particular,\\nand another meager meal  all toiled for without even the necessities of\\nsatisfactory living, and assuredly without the thrilling hopes that\\nmade their life significant, and certainly with a growing sense of\\napproaching calamity.\\n\\nThe outlaw leader rose surly and cross grained. He had to boot Burt\\nto drive him out for the horses. Riggs followed him. Shady Jones did\\nnothing except grumble. Wilson, by common consent, always made the\\nsour dough bread, and he was slow about it this morning. Anson and Moze\\ndid the rest of the work, without alacrity. The girl did not appear.\\n\\n“Is she dead?” growled Anson.\\n\\n“No, she ain't,” replied Wilson, looking up. “She's sleepin'. Let her\\nsleep. She'd shore be a sight better off if she was daid.”\\n\\n“A huh! So would all of this hyar outfit,” was Anson's response.\\n\\n“Wal, Sna ake, I shore reckon we'll all be thet there soon,” drawled\\nWilson, in his familiar cool and irritating tone that said so much more\\nthan the content of the words.\\n\\nAnson did not address the Texas member of his party again.\\n\\nBurt rode bareback into camp, driving half the number of the horses;\\nRiggs followed shortly with several more. But three were missed, one\\nof them being Anson's favorite. He would not have budged without that\\nhorse. During breakfast he growled about his lazy men, and after the\\nmeal tried to urge them off. Riggs went unwillingly. Burt refused to go\\nat all.\\n\\n“Nix. I footed them hills all I'm a goin' to,” he said. “An' from now on\\nI rustle my own hoss.”\\n\\nThe leader glared his reception of this opposition. Perhaps his sense of\\nfairness actuated him once more, for he ordered Shady and Moze out to do\\ntheir share.\\n\\n“Jim, you're the best tracker in this outfit. Suppose you go,” suggested\\nAnson. “You allus used to be the first one off.”\\n\\n“Times has changed, Snake,” was the imperturbable reply.\\n\\n“Wal, won't you go?” demanded the leader, impatiently.\\n\\n“I shore won't.”\\n\\nWilson did not look or intimate in any way that he would not leave the\\ngirl in camp with one or any or all of Anson's gang, but the truth was\\nas significant as if he had shouted it. The slow thinking Moze gave\\nWilson a sinister look.\\n\\n“Boss, ain't it funny how a pretty wench  ?” began Shady Jones,\\nsarcastically.\\n\\n“Shut up, you fool!” broke in Anson. “Come on, I'll help rustle them\\nhosses.”\\n\\nAfter they had gone Burt took his rifle and strolled off into the\\nforest. Then the girl appeared. Her hair was down, her face pale, with\\ndark shadows. She asked for water to wash her face. Wilson pointed to\\nthe brook, and as she walked slowly toward it he took a comb and a clean\\nscarf from his pack and carried them to her.\\n\\nUpon her return to the camp fire she looked very different with her hair\\narranged and the red stains in her cheeks.\\n\\n“Miss, air you hungry?” asked Wilson.\\n\\n“Yes, I am,” she replied.\\n\\nHe helped her to portions of bread, venison and gravy, and a cup of\\ncoffee. Evidently she relished the meat, but she had to force down the\\nrest.\\n\\n“Where are they all?” she asked.\\n\\n“Rustlin' the hosses.”\\n\\nProbably she divined that he did not want to talk, for the fleeting\\nglance she gave him attested to a thought that his voice or demeanor had\\nchanged. Presently she sought a seat under the aspen tree, out of\\nthe sun, and the smoke continually blowing in her face; and there she\\nstayed, a forlorn little figure, for all the resolute lips and defiant\\neyes.\\n\\nThe Texan paced to and fro beside the camp fire with bent head,\\nand hands locked behind him. But for the swinging gun he would have\\nresembled a lanky farmer, coatless and hatless, with his brown vest\\nopen, his trousers stuck in the top of the high boots.\\n\\nAnd neither he nor the girl changed their positions relatively for\\na long time. At length, however, after peering into the woods, and\\nlistening, he remarked to the girl that he would be back in a moment,\\nand then walked off around the spruces.\\n\\nNo sooner had he disappeared  in fact, so quickly after ward that it\\npresupposed design instead of accident  than Riggs came running from the\\nopposite side of the glade. He ran straight to the girl, who sprang to\\nher feet.\\n\\n“I hid  two of the  horses,” he panted, husky with excitement. “I'll\\ntake  two saddles. You grab some grub. We'll run for it.”\\n\\n“No,” she cried, stepping back.\\n\\n“But it's not safe  for us  here,” he said, hurriedly, glancing all\\naround. “I'll take you  home. I swear... Not safe  I tell you  this\\ngang's after me. Hurry!”\\n\\nHe laid hold of two saddles, one with each hand. The moment had reddened\\nhis face, brightened his eyes, made his action strong.\\n\\n“I'm safer  here with this outlaw gang,” she replied.\\n\\n“You won't come!” His color began to lighten then, and his face to\\ndistort. He dropped his hold on the saddles.\\n\\n“Harve Riggs, I'd rather become a toy and a rag for these ruffians than\\nspend an hour alone with you,” she flashed at him, in unquenchable hate.\\n\\n“I'll drag you!”\\n\\nHe seized her, but could not hold her. Breaking away, she screamed.\\n\\n“Help!”\\n\\nThat whitened his face, drove him to frenzy. Leaping forward, he struck\\nher a hard blow across the mouth. It staggered her, and, tripping on a\\nsaddle, she fell. His hands flew to her throat, ready to choke her. But\\nshe lay still and held her tongue. Then he dragged her to her feet.\\n\\n“Hurry now  grab that pack  an' follow me.” Again Riggs laid hold of the\\ntwo saddles. A desperate gleam, baleful and vainglorious, flashed over\\nhis face. He was living his one great adventure.\\n\\nThe girl's eyes dilated. They looked beyond him. Her lips opened.\\n\\n“Scream again an' I'll kill you!” he cried, hoarsely and swiftly. The\\nvery opening of her lips had terrified Riggs.\\n\\n“Reckon one scream was enough,” spoke a voice, slow, but without the\\ndrawl, easy and cool, yet incalculable in some terrible sense.\\n\\nRiggs wheeled with inarticulate cry. Wilson stood a few paces off, with\\nhis gun half leveled, low down. His face seemed as usual, only his eyes\\nheld a quivering, light intensity, like boiling molten silver.\\n\\n“Girl, what made thet blood on your mouth?”\\n\\n“Riggs hit me!” she whispered. Then at something she feared or saw or\\ndivined she shrank back, dropped on her knees, and crawled into the\\nspruce shelter.\\n\\n“Wal, Riggs, I'd invite you to draw if thet 'd be any use,” said Wilson.\\nThis speech was reflective, yet it hurried a little.\\n\\nRiggs could not draw nor move nor speak. He seemed turned to stone,\\nexcept his jaw, which slowly fell.\\n\\n“Harve Riggs, gunman from down Missouri way,” continued the voice of\\nincalculable intent, “reckon you've looked into a heap of gun barrels in\\nyour day. Shore! Wal, look in this heah one!”\\n\\nWilson deliberately leveled the gun on a line with Riggs's starting\\neyes.\\n\\n“Wasn't you heard to brag in Turner's saloon  thet you could see lead\\ncomin'  an' dodge it? Shore you must be swift!... DODGE THIS HEAH\\nBULLET!”\\n\\nThe gun spouted flame and boomed. One of Riggs's starting, popping\\neyes  the right one  went out, like a lamp. The other rolled horribly,\\nthen set in blank dead fixedness. Riggs swayed in slow motion until a\\nlost balance felled him heavily, an inert mass.\\n\\nWilson bent over the prostrate form. Strange, violent contrast to the\\ncool scorn of the preceding moment! Hissing, spitting, as if poisoned by\\npassion, he burst with the hate that his character had forbidden him to\\nexpress on a living counterfeit. Wilson was shaken, as if by a palsy. He\\nchoked over passionate, incoherent invective. It was class hate first,\\nthen the hate of real manhood for a craven, then the hate of disgrace\\nfor a murder. No man so fair as a gun fighter in the Western creed of an\\n“even break”!\\n\\nWilson's terrible cataclysm of passion passed. Straightening up, he\\nsheathed his weapon and began a slow pace before the fire. Not many\\nmoments afterward he jerked his head high and listened. Horses were\\nsoftly thudding through the forest. Soon Anson rode into sight with\\nhis men and one of the strayed horses. It chanced, too, that young Burt\\nappeared on the other side of the glade. He walked quickly, as one who\\nanticipated news.\\n\\nSnake Anson as he dismounted espied the dead man.\\n\\n“Jim  I thought I heard a shot.”\\n\\nThe others exclaimed and leaped off their horses to view the prostrate\\nform with that curiosity and strange fear common to all men confronted\\nby sight of sudden death.\\n\\nThat emotion was only momentary.\\n\\n“Shot his lamp out!” ejaculated Moze.\\n\\n“Wonder how Gunman Riggs liked thet plumb center peg!” exclaimed Shady\\nJones, with a hard laugh.\\n\\n“Back of his head all gone!” gasped young Burt. Not improbably he had\\nnot seen a great many bullet marked men.\\n\\n“Jim!  the long haired fool didn't try to draw on you!” exclaimed Snake\\nAnson, astounded.\\n\\nWilson neither spoke nor ceased his pacing.\\n\\n“What was it over?” added Anson, curiously.\\n\\n“He hit the gurl,” replied Wilson.\\n\\nThen there were long drawn exclamations all around, and glance met\\nglance.\\n\\n“Jim, you saved me the job,” continued the outlaw leader. “An' I'm much\\nobliged... Fellars, search Riggs an' we'll divvy... Thet all right,\\nJim?”\\n\\n“Shore, an' you can have my share.”\\n\\nThey found bank notes in the man's pocket and considerable gold worn in\\na money belt around his waist. Shady Jones appropriated his boots, and\\nMoze his gun. Then they left him as he had fallen.\\n\\n“Jim, you'll have to track them lost hosses. Two still missin' an' one\\nof them's mine,” called Anson as Wilson paced to the end of his beat.\\n\\nThe girl heard Anson, for she put her head out of the spruce shelter and\\ncalled: “Riggs said he'd hid two of the horses. They must be close. He\\ncame that way.”\\n\\n“Howdy, kid! Thet's good news,” replied Anson. His spirits were rising.\\n“He must hev wanted you to slope with him?”\\n\\n“Yes. I wouldn't go.”\\n\\n“An' then he hit you?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Wal, recallin' your talk of yestiddy, I can't see as Mister Riggs\\nlasted much longer hyar than he'd hev lasted in Texas. We've some of\\nthet great country right in our outfit.”\\n\\nThe girl withdrew her white face.\\n\\n“It's break camp, boys,” was the leader's order. “A couple of you look\\nup them hosses. They'll be hid in some thick spruces. The rest of us 'll\\npack.”\\n\\n\\nSoon the gang was on the move, heading toward the height of land, and\\nswerving from it only to find soft and grassy ground that would not\\nleave any tracks.\\n\\nThey did not travel more than a dozen miles during the afternoon, but\\nthey climbed bench after bench until they reached the timbered plateau\\nthat stretched in sheer black slope up to the peaks. Here rose the great\\nand gloomy forest of firs and pines, with the spruce overshadowed and\\nthinned out. The last hour of travel was tedious and toilsome, a zigzag,\\nwinding, breaking, climbing hunt for the kind of camp site suited\\nto Anson's fancy. He seemed to be growing strangely irrational about\\nselecting places to camp. At last, for no reason that could have been\\nmanifest to a good woodsman, he chose a gloomy bowl in the center of the\\ndensest forest that had been traversed. The opening, if such it could\\nhave been called, was not a park or even a glade. A dark cliff, with\\nstrange holes, rose to one side, but not so high as the lofty pines that\\nbrushed it. Along its base babbled a brook, running over such formation\\nof rock that from different points near at hand it gave forth different\\nsounds, some singing, others melodious, and one at least of a hollow,\\nweird, deep sound, not loud, but strangely penetrating.\\n\\n“Sure spooky I say,” observed Shady, sentiently.\\n\\nThe little uplift of mood, coincident with the rifling of Riggs's\\nperson, had not worn over to this evening camp. What talk the outlaws\\nindulged in was necessary and conducted in low tones. The place enjoined\\nsilence.\\n\\nWilson performed for the girl very much the same service as he had the\\nnight before. Only he advised her not to starve herself; she must eat\\nto keep up her strength. She complied at the expense of considerable\\neffort.\\n\\nAs it had been a back breaking day, in which all of them, except the\\ngirl, had climbed miles on foot, they did not linger awake long enough\\nafter supper to learn what a wild, weird, and pitch black spot the\\noutlaw leader had chosen. The little spaces of open ground between the\\nhuge trunked pine trees had no counterpart up in the lofty spreading\\nfoliage. Not a star could blink a wan ray of light into that Stygian\\npit. The wind, cutting down over abrupt heights farther up, sang in the\\npine needles as if they were strings vibrant with chords. Dismal creaks\\nwere audible. They were the forest sounds of branch or tree rubbing one\\nanother, but which needed the corrective medium of daylight to convince\\nany human that they were other than ghostly. Then, despite the wind and\\ndespite the changing murmur of the brook, there seemed to be a silence\\ninsulating them, as deep and impenetrable as the darkness.\\n\\nBut the outlaws, who were fugitives now, slept the sleep of the weary,\\nand heard nothing. They awoke with the sun, when the forest seemed smoky\\nin a golden gloom, when light and bird and squirrel proclaimed the day.\\n\\nThe horses had not strayed out of this basin during the night, a\\ncircumstance that Anson was not slow to appreciate.\\n\\n“It ain't no cheerful camp, but I never seen a safer place to hole up\\nin,” he remarked to Wilson.\\n\\n“Wal, yes  if any place is safe,” replied that ally, dubiously.\\n\\n“We can watch our back tracks. There ain't any other way to git in hyar\\nthet I see.”\\n\\n“Snake, we was tolerable fair sheep rustlers, but we're no good\\nwoodsmen.”\\n\\nAnson grumbled his disdain of this comrade who had once been his\\nmainstay. Then he sent Burt out to hunt fresh meat and engaged his other\\nmen at cards. As they now had the means to gamble, they at once became\\nabsorbed. Wilson smoked and divided his thoughtful gaze between the\\ngamblers and the drooping figure of the girl. The morning air was\\nkeen, and she, evidently not caring to be near her captors beside the\\ncamp fire, had sought the only sunny spot in this gloomy dell. A couple\\nof hours passed; the sun climbed high; the air grew warmer. Once the\\noutlaw leader raised his head to scan the heavy timbered slopes that\\ninclosed the camp.\\n\\n“Jim, them hosses are strayin' off,” he observed.\\n\\nWilson leisurely rose and stalked off across the small, open patches,\\nin the direction of the horses. They had grazed around from the right\\ntoward the outlet of the brook. Here headed a ravine, dense and green.\\nTwo of the horses had gone down. Wilson evidently heard them, though\\nthey were not in sight, and he circled somewhat so as to get ahead of\\nthem and drive them back. The invisible brook ran down over the rocks\\nwith murmur and babble. He halted with instinctive action. He listened.\\nForest sounds, soft, lulling, came on the warm, pine scented breeze. It\\nwould have taken no keen ear to hear soft and rapid padded footfalls.\\nHe moved on cautiously and turned into a little open, mossy spot,\\nbrown matted and odorous, full of ferns and bluebells. In the middle\\nof this, deep in the moss, he espied a huge round track of a cougar.\\nHe bent over it. Suddenly he stiffened, then straightened guardedly. At\\nthat instant he received a hard prod in the back. Throwing up his hands,\\nhe stood still, then slowly turned. A tall hunter in gray buckskin,\\ngray eyed and square jawed, had him covered with a cocked rifle. And\\nbeside this hunter stood a monster cougar, snarling and blinking.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\n“Howdy, Dale,” drawled Wilson. “Reckon you're a little previous on me.”\\n\\n“Sssssh! Not so loud,” said the hunter, in low voice. “You're Jim\\nWilson?”\\n\\n“Shore am. Say, Dale, you showed up soon. Or did you jest happen to run\\nacrost us?”\\n\\n“I've trailed you. Wilson, I'm after the girl.”\\n\\n“I knowed thet when I seen you!”\\n\\nThe cougar seemed actuated by the threatening position of his master,\\nand he opened his mouth, showing great yellow fangs, and spat at Wilson.\\nThe outlaw apparently had no fear of Dale or the cocked rifle, but that\\nhuge, snarling cat occasioned him uneasiness.\\n\\n“Wilson, I've heard you spoken of as a white outlaw,” said Dale.\\n\\n“Mebbe I am. But shore I'll be a scared one in a minit. Dale, he's goin'\\nto jump me!”\\n\\n“The cougar won't jump you unless I make him. Wilson, if I let you go\\nwill you get the girl for me?”\\n\\n“Wal, lemme see. Supposin' I refuse?” queried Wilson, shrewdly.\\n\\n“Then, one way or another, it's all up with you.”\\n\\n“Reckon I 'ain't got much choice. Yes, I'll do it. But, Dale, are you\\ngoin' to take my word for thet an' let me go back to Anson?”\\n\\n“Yes, I am. You're no fool. An' I believe you're square. I've got Anson\\nand his gang corralled. You can't slip me  not in these woods. I could\\nrun off your horses  pick you off one by one  or turn the cougar loose\\non you at night.”\\n\\n“Shore. It's your game. Anson dealt himself this hand... Between you\\nan' me, Dale, I never liked the deal.”\\n\\n“Who shot Riggs?... I found his body.”\\n\\n“Wal, yours truly was around when thet come off,” replied Wilson, with\\nan involuntary little shudder. Some thought made him sick.\\n\\n“The girl? Is she safe  unharmed?” queried Dale, hurriedly.\\n\\n“She's shore jest as safe an' sound as when she was home. Dale, she's\\nthe gamest kid thet ever breathed! Why, no one could hev ever made me\\nbelieve a girl, a kid like her, could hev the nerve she's got. Nothin's\\nhappened to her 'cept Riggs hit her in the mouth... I killed him for\\nthet... An', so help me, God, I believe it's been workin' in me to save\\nher somehow! Now it'll not be so hard.”\\n\\n“But how?” demanded Dale.\\n\\n“Lemme see... Wal, I've got to sneak her out of camp an' meet you.\\nThet's all.”\\n\\n“It must be done quick.”\\n\\n“But, Dale, listen,” remonstrated Wilson, earnestly. “Too quick 'll\\nbe as bad as too slow. Snake is sore these days, gittin' sorer all the\\ntime. He might savvy somethin', if I ain't careful, an' kill the girl\\nor do her harm. I know these fellars. They're all ready to go to pieces.\\nAn' shore I must play safe. Shore it'd be safer to have a plan.”\\n\\nWilson's shrewd, light eyes gleamed with an idea. He was about to lower\\none of his upraised hands, evidently to point to the cougar, when he\\nthought better of that.\\n\\n“Anson's scared of cougars. Mebbe we can scare him an' the gang so it\\n'd be easy to sneak the girl off. Can you make thet big brute do tricks?\\nRush the camp at night an' squall an' chase off the horses?”\\n\\n“I'll guarantee to scare Anson out of ten years' growth,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Shore it's a go, then,” resumed Wilson, as if glad. “I'll post the\\ngirl  give her a hunch to do her part. You sneak up to night jest before\\ndark. I'll hev the gang worked up. An' then you put the cougar to his\\ntricks, whatever you want. When the gang gits wild I'll grab the girl\\nan' pack her off down heah or somewheres aboot an' whistle fer you...\\nBut mebbe thet ain't so good. If thet cougar comes pilin' into camp he\\nmight jump me instead of one of the gang. An' another hunch. He might\\nslope up on me in the dark when I was tryin' to find you. Shore thet\\nain't appealin' to me.”\\n\\n“Wilson, this cougar is a pet,” replied Dale. “You think he's dangerous,\\nbut he's not. No more than a kitten. He only looks fierce. He has never\\nbeen hurt by a person an' he's never fought anythin' himself but deer\\nan' bear. I can make him trail any scent. But the truth is I couldn't\\nmake him hurt you or anybody. All the same, he can be made to scare the\\nhair off any one who doesn't know him.”\\n\\n“Shore thet settles me. I'll be havin' a grand joke while them fellars\\nis scared to death... Dale, you can depend on me. An' I'm beholdin'\\nto you fer what 'll square me some with myself... To night, an' if it\\nwon't work then, to morrer night shore!”\\n\\nDale lowered the rifle. The big cougar spat again. Wilson dropped his\\nhands and, stepping forward, split the green wall of intersecting spruce\\nbranches. Then he turned up the ravine toward the glen. Once there, in\\nsight of his comrades, his action and expression changed.\\n\\n“Hosses all thar, Jim?” asked Anson, as he picked up, his cards.\\n\\n“Shore. They act awful queer, them hosses,” replied. Wilson. “They're\\nafraid of somethin'.”\\n\\n“A huh! Silvertip mebbe,” muttered Anson. “Jim, You jest keep watch of\\nthem hosses. We'd be done if some tarnal varmint stampeded them.”\\n\\n“Reckon I'm elected to do all the work now,” complained Wilson, “while\\nyou card sharps cheat each other. Rustle the hosses  an' water an'\\nfire wood. Cook an' wash. Hey?”\\n\\n“No one I ever seen can do them camp tricks any better 'n Jim Wilson,”\\n replied Anson.\\n\\n“Jim, you're a lady's man an' thar's our pretty hoodoo over thar to\\nfeed an' amoose,” remarked Shady Jones, with a smile that disarmed his\\nspeech.\\n\\nThe outlaws guffawed.\\n\\n“Git out, Jim, you're breakin' up the game,” said Moze, who appeared\\nloser.\\n\\n“Wal, thet gurl would starve if it wasn't fer me,” replied Wilson,\\ngenially, and he walked over toward her, beginning to address her, quite\\nloudly, as he approached. “Wal, miss, I'm elected cook an' I'd shore\\nlike to heah what you fancy fer dinner.”\\n\\nThe outlaws heard, for they guffawed again. “Haw! Haw! if Jim ain't\\nfunny!” exclaimed Anson.\\n\\nThe girl looked up amazed. Wilson was winking at her, and when he got\\nnear he began to speak rapidly and low.\\n\\n“I jest met Dale down in the woods with his pet cougar. He's after you.\\nI'm goin' to help him git you safe away. Now you do your part. I want\\nyou to pretend you've gone crazy. Savvy? Act out of your head! Shore\\nI don't care what you do or say, only act crazy. An' don't be scared.\\nWe're goin' to scare the gang so I'll hev a chance to sneak you away.\\nTo night or to morrow  shore.”\\n\\nBefore he began to speak she was pale, sad, dull of eye. Swiftly, with\\nhis words, she was transformed, and when he had ended she did not appear\\nthe same girl. She gave him one blazing flash of comprehension and\\nnodded her head rapidly.\\n\\n“Yes, I understand. I'll do it!” she whispered.\\n\\nThe outlaw turned slowly away with the most abstract air, confounded\\namid his shrewd acting, and he did not collect himself until half way\\nback to his comrades. Then, beginning to hum an old darky tune, he\\nstirred up and replenished the fire, and set about preparation for the\\nmidday meal. But he did not miss anything going on around him. He saw\\nthe girl go into her shelter and come out with her hair all down over\\nher face. Wilson, back to his comrades, grinned his glee, and he wagged\\nhis head as if he thought the situation was developing.\\n\\nThe gambling outlaws, however, did not at once see the girl preening\\nherself and smoothing her long hair in a way calculated to startle.\\n\\n“Busted!” ejaculated Anson, with a curse, as he slammed down his cards.\\n“If I ain't hoodooed I'm a two bit of a gambler!”\\n\\n“Sartin you're hoodooed,” said Shady Jones, in scorn. “Is thet jest\\ndawnin' on you?”\\n\\n“Boss, you play like a cow stuck in the mud,” remarked Moze,\\nlaconically.\\n\\n“Fellars, it ain't funny,” declared Anson, with pathetic gravity. “I'm\\njest gittin' on to myself. Somethin's wrong. Since 'way last fall no\\nluck  nothin' but the wust end of everythin'. I ain't blamin' anybody.\\nI'm the boss. It's me thet's off.”\\n\\n“Snake, shore it was the gurl deal you made,” rejoined Wilson, who had\\nlistened. “I told you. Our troubles hev only begun. An' I can see the\\nwind up. Look!”\\n\\nWilson pointed to where the girl stood, her hair flying wildly all over\\nher face and shoulders. She was making most elaborate bows to an old\\nstump, sweeping the ground with her tresses in her obeisance.\\n\\nAnson started. He grew utterly astounded. His amaze was ludicrous. And\\nthe other two men looked to stare, to equal their leader's bewilderment.\\n\\n“What 'n hell's come over her?” asked Anson, dubiously. “Must hev perked\\nup... But she ain't feelin' thet gay!”\\n\\nWilson tapped his forehead with a significant finger.\\n\\n“Shore I was scared of her this mawnin',” he whispered.\\n\\n“Naw!” exclaimed Anson, incredulously.\\n\\n“If she hain't queer I never seen no queer wimmin,” vouchsafed Shady\\nJones, and it would have been judged, by the way he wagged his head,\\nthat he had been all his days familiar with women.\\n\\nMoze looked beyond words, and quite alarmed.\\n\\n“I seen it comin',” declared Wilson, very much excited. “But I was\\nscared to say so. You all made fun of me aboot her. Now I shore wish I\\nhad spoken up.”\\n\\nAnson nodded solemnly. He did not believe the evidence of his sight,\\nbut the facts seemed stunning. As if the girl were a dangerous and\\nincomprehensible thing, he approached her step by step. Wilson followed,\\nand the others appeared drawn irresistibly.\\n\\n“Hey thar  kid!” called Anson, hoarsely.\\n\\nThe girl drew her slight form up haughtily. Through her spreading\\ntresses her eyes gleamed unnaturally upon the outlaw leader. But she\\ndeigned not to reply.\\n\\n“Hey thar  you Rayner girl!” added Anson, lamely. “What's ailin' you?”\\n\\n“My lord! did you address me?” she asked, loftily.\\n\\nShady Jones got over his consternation and evidently extracted some\\nhumor from the situation, as his dark face began to break its strain.\\n\\n“Aww!” breathed Anson, heavily.\\n\\n“Ophelia awaits your command, my lord. I've been gathering flowers,”\\n she said, sweetly, holding up her empty hands as if they contained a\\nbouquet.\\n\\nShady Jones exploded in convulsed laughter. But his merriment was not\\nshared. And suddenly it brought disaster upon him. The girl flew at him.\\n\\n“Why do you croak, you toad? I will have you whipped and put in irons,\\nyou scullion!” she cried, passionately.\\n\\nShady underwent a remarkable change, and stumbled in his backward\\nretreat. Then she snapped her fingers in Moze's face.\\n\\n“You black devil! Get hence! Avaunt!”\\n\\nAnson plucked up courage enough to touch her.\\n\\n“Aww! Now, Ophelyar  ”\\n\\nProbably he meant to try to humor her, but she screamed, and he jumped\\nback as if she might burn him. She screamed shrilly, in wild, staccato\\nnotes.\\n\\n“You! You!” she pointed her finger at the outlaw leader. “You brute to\\nwomen! You ran off from your wife!”\\n\\nAnson turned plum color and then slowly white. The girl must have sent a\\nrandom shot home.\\n\\n“And now the devil's turned you into a snake. A long, scaly snake with\\ngreen eyes! Uugh! You'll crawl on your belly soon  when my cowboy finds\\nyou. And he'll tramp you in the dust.”\\n\\nShe floated away from them and began to whirl gracefully, arms spread\\nand hair flying; and then, apparently oblivious of the staring men, she\\nbroke into a low, sweet song. Next she danced around a pine, then danced\\ninto her little green inclosure. From which presently she sent out the\\nmost doleful moans.\\n\\n“Aww! What a shame!” burst out Anson. “Thet fine, healthy, nervy kid!\\nClean gone! Daffy! Crazy 'n a bedbug!”\\n\\n“Shore it's a shame,” protested Wilson. “But it's wuss for us. Lord! if\\nwe was hoodooed before, what will we be now? Didn't I tell you, Snake\\nAnson? You was warned. Ask Shady an' Moze  they see what's up.”\\n\\n“No luck 'll ever come our way ag'in,” predicted Shady, mournfully.\\n\\n“It beats me, boss, it beats me,” muttered Moze.\\n\\n“A crazy woman on my hands! If thet ain't the last straw!” broke out\\nAnson, tragically, as he turned away. Ignorant, superstitious, worked\\nupon by things as they seemed, the outlaw imagined himself at last beset\\nby malign forces. When he flung himself down upon one of the packs his\\nbig red haired hands shook. Shady and Moze resembled two other men at\\nthe end of their ropes.\\n\\nWilson's tense face twitched, and he averted it, as apparently he fought\\noff a paroxysm of some nature. Just then Anson swore a thundering oath.\\n\\n“Crazy or not, I'll git gold out of thet kid!” he roared.\\n\\n“But, man, talk sense. Are you gittin' daffy, too? I declare this\\noutfit's been eatin' loco. You can't git gold fer her!” said Wilson,\\ndeliberately.\\n\\n“Why can't I?”\\n\\n“'Cause we're tracked. We can't make no dickers. Why, in another day or\\nso we'll be dodgin' lead.”\\n\\n“Tracked! Whar 'd you git thet idee? As soon as this?” queried Anson,\\nlifting his head like a striking snake. His men, likewise, betrayed\\nsudden interest.\\n\\n“Shore it's no idee. I 'ain't seen any one. But I feel it in my senses.\\nI hear somebody comin'  a step on our trail  all the time  night in\\nparticular. Reckon there's a big posse after us.”\\n\\n“Wal, if I see or hear anythin' I'll knock the girl on the head an'\\nwe'll dig out of hyar,” replied Anson, sullenly.\\n\\nWilson executed a swift forward motion, violent and passionate, so\\nutterly unlike what might have been looked for from him, that the three\\noutlaws gaped.\\n\\n“Then you'll shore hev to knock Jim Wilson on the haid first,” he said,\\nin voice as strange as his action.\\n\\n“Jim! You wouldn't go back on me!” implored Anson, with uplifted hands,\\nin a dignity of pathos.\\n\\n“I'm losin' my haid, too, an' you shore might as well knock it in, an'\\nyou'll hev to before I'll stand you murderin' thet pore little gurl\\nyou've drove crazy.”\\n\\n“Jim, I was only mad,” replied Anson. “Fer thet matter, I'm growin'\\ndaffy myself. Aw! we all need a good stiff drink of whisky.”\\n\\nSo he tried to throw off gloom and apprehension, but he failed. His\\ncomrades did not rally to his help. Wilson walked away, nodding his\\nhead.\\n\\n“Boss, let Jim alone,” whispered Shady. “It's orful the way you buck\\nag'in' him  when you seen he's stirred up. Jim's true blue. But you\\ngotta be careful.”\\n\\nMoze corroborated this statement by gloomy nods.\\n\\nWhen the card playing was resumed, Anson did not join the game, and\\nboth Moze and Shady evinced little of that whole hearted obsession which\\nusually attended their gambling. Anson lay at length, his head in a\\nsaddle, scowling at the little shelter where the captive girl kept\\nherself out of sight. At times a faint song or laugh, very unnatural,\\nwas wafted across the space. Wilson plodded at the cooking and\\napparently heard no sounds. Presently he called the men to eat, which\\noffice they surlily and silently performed, as if it was a favor\\nbestowed upon the cook.\\n\\n“Snake, hadn't I ought to take a bite of grub over to the gurl?” asked\\nWilson.\\n\\n“Do you hev to ask me thet?” snapped Anson. “She's gotta be fed, if we\\nhev to stuff it down her throat.”\\n\\n“Wal, I ain't stuck on the job,” replied Wilson. “But I'll tackle it,\\nseein' you all got cold feet.”\\n\\nWith plate and cup be reluctantly approached the little lean to, and,\\nkneeling, he put his head inside. The girl, quick eyed and alert, had\\nevidently seen him coming. At any rate, she greeted him with a cautious\\nsmile.\\n\\n“Jim, was I pretty good?” she whispered.\\n\\n“Miss, you was shore the finest aktress I ever seen,” he responded, in a\\nlow voice. “But you dam near overdid it. I'm goin' to tell Anson you're\\nsick now  poisoned or somethin' awful. Then we'll wait till night. Dale\\nshore will help us out.”\\n\\n“Oh, I'm on fire to get away,” she exclaimed. “Jim Wilson, I'll never\\nforget you as long as I live!”\\n\\nHe seemed greatly embarrassed.\\n\\n“Wal  miss  I  I'll do my best licks. But I ain't gamblin' none on\\nresults. Be patient. Keep your nerve. Don't get scared. I reckon between\\nme an' Dale you'll git away from heah.”\\n\\nWithdrawing his head, he got up and returned to the camp fire, where\\nAnson was waiting curiously.\\n\\n“I left the grub. But she didn't touch it. Seems sort of sick to me,\\nlike she was poisoned.”\\n\\n“Jim, didn't I hear you talkin'?” asked Anson.\\n\\n“Shore. I was coaxin' her. Reckon she ain't so ranty as she was. But she\\nshore is doubled up, an' sickish.”\\n\\n“Wuss an' wuss all the time,” said Anson, between his teeth. “An'\\nwhere's Burt? Hyar it's noon an' he left early. He never was no\\nwoodsman. He's got lost.”\\n\\n“Either thet or he's run into somethin',” replied Wilson, thoughtfully.\\n\\nAnson doubled a huge fist and cursed deep under his breath  the reaction\\nof a man whose accomplices and partners and tools, whose luck, whose\\nfaith in himself had failed him. He flung himself down under a tree, and\\nafter a while, when his rigidity relaxed, he probably fell asleep. Moze\\nand Shady kept at their game. Wilson paced to and fro, sat down, and\\nthen got up to bunch the horses again, walked around the dell and back\\nto camp. The afternoon hours were long. And they were waiting hours. The\\nact of waiting appeared on the surface of all these outlaws did.\\n\\nAt sunset the golden gloom of the glen changed to a vague, thick\\ntwilight. Anson rolled over, yawned, and sat up. As he glanced around,\\nevidently seeking Burt, his face clouded.\\n\\n“No sign of Burt?” he asked.\\n\\nWilson expressed a mild surprise. “Wal, Snake, you ain't expectin' Burt\\nnow?”\\n\\n“I am, course I am. Why not?” demanded Anson. “Any other time we'd look\\nfer him, wouldn't we?”\\n\\n“Any other time ain't now... Burt won't ever come back!” Wilson spoke\\nit with a positive finality.\\n\\n“A huh! Some more of them queer feelin's of yourn  operatin' again, hey?\\nThem onnatural kind thet you can't explain, hey?”\\n\\nAnson's queries were bitter and rancorous.\\n\\n“Yes. An', Snake, I tax you with this heah. Ain't any of them queer\\nfeelin's operatin' in you?”\\n\\n“No!” rolled out the leader, savagely. But his passionate denial was a\\nproof that he lied. From the moment of this outburst, which was a fierce\\nclinging to the old, brave instincts of his character, unless a sudden\\nchange marked the nature of his fortunes, he would rapidly deteriorate\\nto the breaking point. And in such brutal, unrestrained natures as his\\nthis breaking point meant a desperate stand, a desperate forcing of\\nevents, a desperate accumulation of passions that stalked out to deal\\nand to meet disaster and blood and death.\\n\\nWilson put a little wood on the fire and he munched a biscuit. No one\\nasked him to cook. No one made any effort to do so. One by one each man\\nwent to the pack to get some bread and meat.\\n\\nThen they waited as men who knew not what they waited for, yet hated and\\ndreaded it.\\n\\nTwilight in that glen was naturally a strange, veiled condition of the\\natmosphere. It was a merging of shade and light, which two seemed to\\nmake gray, creeping shadows.\\n\\nSuddenly a snorting and stamping of the horses startled the men.\\n\\n“Somethin' scared the hosses,” said Anson, rising. “Come on.”\\n\\nMoze accompanied him, and they disappeared in the gloom. More trampling\\nof hoofs was heard, then a cracking of brush, and the deep voices of\\nmen. At length the two outlaws returned, leading three of the horses,\\nwhich they haltered in the open glen.\\n\\nThe camp fire light showed Anson's face dark and serious.\\n\\n“Jim, them hosses are wilder 'n deer,” he said. “I ketched mine, an'\\nMoze got two. But the rest worked away whenever we come close. Some\\nvarmint has scared them bad. We all gotta rustle out thar quick.”\\n\\nWilson rose, shaking his head doubtfully. And at that moment the quiet\\nair split to a piercing, horrid neigh of a terrified horse. Prolonged to\\na screech, it broke and ended. Then followed snorts of fright, pound and\\ncrack and thud of hoofs, and crash of brush; then a gathering thumping,\\ncrashing roar, split by piercing sounds.\\n\\n“Stampede!” yelled Anson, and he ran to hold his own horse, which he had\\nhaltered right in camp. It was big and wild looking, and now reared and\\nplunged to break away. Anson just got there in time, and then it took\\nall his weight to pull the horse down. Not until the crashing, snorting,\\npounding melee had subsided and died away over the rim of the glen did\\nAnson dare leave his frightened favorite.\\n\\n“Gone! Our horses are gone! Did you hear 'em?” he exclaimed, blankly.\\n\\n“Shore. They're a cut up an' crippled bunch by now,” replied Wilson.\\n\\n“Boss, we'll never git 'ern back, not 'n a hundred years,” declared\\nMoze.\\n\\n“Thet settles us, Snake Anson,” stridently added Shady Jones. “Them\\nhosses are gone! You can kiss your hand to them... They wasn't hobbled.\\nThey hed an orful scare. They split on thet stampede an' they'll never\\ngit together. ... See what you've fetched us to!”\\n\\nUnder the force of this triple arraignment the outlaw leader dropped to\\nhis seat, staggered and silenced. In fact, silence fell upon all the men\\nand likewise enfolded the glen.\\n\\nNight set in jet black, dismal, lonely, without a star. Faintly the wind\\nmoaned. Weirdly the brook babbled through its strange chords to end in\\nthe sound that was hollow. It was never the same  a rumble, as if faint,\\ndistant thunder  a deep gurgle, as of water drawn into a vortex  a\\nrolling, as of a stone in swift current. The black cliff was invisible,\\nyet seemed to have many weird faces; the giant pines loomed spectral;\\nthe shadows were thick, moving, changing. Flickering lights from the\\ncamp fire circled the huge trunks and played fantastically over the\\nbrooding men. This camp fire did not burn or blaze cheerily; it had no\\nglow, no sputter, no white heart, no red, living embers. One by one the\\noutlaws, as if with common consent, tried their hands at making the fire\\nburn aright. What little wood had been collected was old; it would burn\\nup with false flare, only to die quickly.\\n\\nAfter a while not one of the outlaws spoke or stirred. Not one smoked.\\nTheir gloomy eyes were fixed on the fire. Each one was concerned with\\nhis own thoughts, his own lonely soul unconsciously full of a doubt of\\nthe future. That brooding hour severed him from comrade.\\n\\nAt night nothing seemed the same as it was by day. With success and\\nplenty, with full blooded action past and more in store, these outlaws\\nwere as different from their present state as this black night was\\ndifferent from the bright day they waited for. Wilson, though he played\\na deep game of deceit for the sake of the helpless girl  and thus did\\nnot have haunting and superstitious fears on her account  was probably\\nmore conscious of impending catastrophe than any of them.\\n\\nThe evil they had done spoke in the voice of nature, out of the\\ndarkness, and was interpreted by each according to his hopes and fears.\\nFear was their predominating sense. For years they had lived with some\\nspecies of fear  of honest men or vengeance, of pursuit, of starvation,\\nof lack of drink or gold, of blood and death, of stronger men, of luck,\\nof chance, of fate, of mysterious nameless force. Wilson was the type of\\nfearless spirit, but he endured the most gnawing and implacable fear of\\nall  that of himself  that he must inevitably fall to deeds beneath his\\nmanhood.\\n\\nSo they hunched around the camp fire, brooding because hope was at\\nlowest ebb; listening because the weird, black silence, with its moan\\nof wind and hollow laugh of brook, compelled them to hear; waiting for\\nsleep, for the hours to pass, for whatever was to come.\\n\\nAnd it was Anson who caught the first intimation of an impending doom.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\n“Listen!”\\n\\nAnson whispered tensely. His poise was motionless, his eyes roved\\neverywhere. He held up a shaking, bludgy finger, to command silence.\\n\\nA third and stranger sound accompanied the low, weird moan of the wind,\\nand the hollow mockery of the brook  and it seemed a barely perceptible,\\nexquisitely delicate wail or whine. It filled in the lulls between the\\nother sounds.\\n\\n“If thet's some varmint he's close,” whispered Anson.\\n\\n“But shore, it's far off,” said Wilson.\\n\\nShady Jones and Moze divided their opinions in the same way.\\n\\nAll breathed freer when the wail ceased, relaxing to their former\\nlounging positions around the fire. An impenetrable wall of blackness\\ncircled the pale space lighted by the camp fire; and this circle\\ncontained the dark, somber group of men in the center, the dying\\ncamp fire, and a few spectral trunks of pines and the tethered horses on\\nthe outer edge. The horses scarcely moved from their tracks, and their\\nerect, alert heads attested to their sensitiveness to the peculiarities\\nof the night.\\n\\nThen, at an unusually quiet lull the strange sound gradually arose to a\\nwailing whine.\\n\\n“It's thet crazy wench cryin',” declared the outlaw leader.\\n\\nApparently his allies accepted that statement with as much relief as\\nthey had expressed for the termination of the sound.\\n\\n“Shore, thet must be it,” agreed Jim Wilson, gravely.\\n\\n“We'll git a lot of sleep with thet gurl whinin' all night,” growled\\nShady Jones.\\n\\n“She gives me the creeps,” said Moze.\\n\\nWilson got up to resume his pondering walk, head bent, hands behind his\\nback, a grim, realistic figure of perturbation.\\n\\n“Jim  set down. You make me nervous,” said Anson, irritably.\\n\\nWilson actually laughed, but low, as if to keep his strange mirth well\\nconfined.\\n\\n“Snake, I'll bet you my hoss an' my gun ag'in' a biscuit thet in aboot\\nsix seconds more or less I'll be stampedin like them hosses.”\\n\\nAnson's lean jaw dropped. The other two outlaws stared with round\\neyes. Wilson was not drunk, they evidently knew; but what he really was\\nappeared a mystery.\\n\\n“Jim Wilson, are you showin' yellow?” queried Anson, hoarsely.\\n\\n“Mebbe. The Lord only knows. But listen heah... Snake, you've seen an'\\nheard people croak?”\\n\\n“You mean cash in  die?”\\n\\n“Shore.”\\n\\n“Wal, yes  a couple or so,” replied Anson, grimly.\\n\\n“But you never seen no one die of shock  of an orful scare?”\\n\\n“No, I reckon I never did.”\\n\\n“I have. An' thet's what's ailin' Jim Wilson,” and he resumed his dogged\\nsteps.\\n\\nAnson and his two comrades exchanged bewildered glances with one\\nanother.\\n\\n“A huh! Say, what's thet got to do with us hyar? asked Anson, presently.\\n\\n“Thet gurl is dyin'!” retorted Wilson, in a voice cracking like a whip.\\n\\nThe three outlaws stiffened in their seats, incredulous, yet\\nirresistibly swayed by emotions that stirred to this dark, lonely,\\nill omened hour.\\n\\nWilson trudged to the edge of the lighted circle, muttering to himself,\\nand came back again; then he trudged farther, this time almost out\\nof sight, but only to return; the third time he vanished in the\\nimpenetrable wall of light. The three men scarcely moved a muscle as\\nthey watched the place where he had disappeared. In a few moments he\\ncame stumbling back.\\n\\n“Shore she's almost gone,” he said, dismally. “It took my nerve, but\\nI felt of her face... Thet orful wail is her breath chokin' in her\\nthroat... Like a death rattle, only long instead of short.”\\n\\n“Wal, if she's gotta croak it's good she gits it over quick,” replied\\nAnson. “I 'ain't hed sleep fer three nights. ... An' what I need is\\nwhisky.”\\n\\n“Snake, thet's gospel you're spoutin',” remarked Shady Jones, morosely.\\n\\nThe direction of sound in the glen was difficult to be assured of, but\\nany man not stirred to a high pitch of excitement could have told that\\nthe difference in volume of this strange wail must have been caused by\\ndifferent distances and positions. Also, when it was loudest, it was\\nmost like a whine. But these outlaws heard with their consciences.\\n\\nAt last it ceased abruptly.\\n\\nWilson again left the group to be swallowed up by the night. His absence\\nwas longer than usual, but he returned hurriedly.\\n\\n“She's daid!” he exclaimed, solemnly. “Thet innocent kid  who never\\nharmed no one  an' who'd make any man better fer seein' her  she's\\ndaid!... Anson, you've shore a heap to answer fer when your time comes.”\\n\\n“What's eatin' you?” demanded the leader, angrily. “Her blood ain't on\\nmy hands.”\\n\\n“It shore is,” shouted Wilson, shaking his hand at Anson. “An' you'll\\nhev to take your medicine. I felt thet comin' all along. An' I feel some\\nmore.”\\n\\n“Aw! She's jest gone to sleep,” declared Anson, shaking his long frame\\nas he rose. “Gimme a light.”\\n\\n“Boss, you're plumb off to go near a dead gurl thet's jest died crazy,”\\n protested Shady Jones.\\n\\n“Off! Haw! Haw! Who ain't off in this outfit, I'd like to know?” Anson\\npossessed himself of a stick blazing at one and, and with this he\\nstalked off toward the lean to where the girl was supposed to be dead.\\nHis gaunt figure, lighted by the torch, certainly fitted the weird,\\nblack surroundings. And it was seen that once near the girl's shelter he\\nproceeded more slowly, until he halted. He bent to peer inside.\\n\\n“SHE'S GONE!” he yelled, in harsh, shaken accents.\\n\\nThan the torch burned out, leaving only a red glow. He whirled it about,\\nbut the blaze did not rekindle. His comrades, peering intently, lost\\nsight of his tall form and the end of the red ended stick. Darkness like\\npitch swallowed him. For a moment no sound intervened. Again the moan of\\nwind, the strange little mocking hollow roar, dominated the place. Then\\nthere came a rush of something, perhaps of air, like the soft swishing\\nof spruce branches swinging aside. Dull, thudding footsteps followed it.\\nAnson came running back to the fire. His aspect was wild, his face pale,\\nhis eyes were fierce and starting from their sockets. He had drawn his\\ngun.\\n\\n“Did  ye  see er hear  anythin'?” he panted, peering back, then all\\naround, and at last at his man.\\n\\n“No. An' I shore was lookin' an' listenin',” replied Wilson.\\n\\n“Boss, there wasn't nothin',” declared Moze.\\n\\n“I ain't so sartin,” said Shady Jones, with doubtful, staring eyes. “I\\nbelieve I heerd a rustlin'.”\\n\\n“She wasn't there!” ejaculated Anson, in wondering awe. “She's gone!...\\nMy torch went out. I couldn't see. An' jest then I felt somethin' was\\npassin'. Fast! I jerked 'round. All was black, an' yet if I didn't see\\na big gray streak I'm crazier 'n thet gurl. But I couldn't swear to\\nanythin' but a rushin' of wind. I felt thet.”\\n\\n“Gone!” exclaimed Wilson, in great alarm. “Fellars, if thet's so, then\\nmebbe she wasn't daid an' she wandered off. ... But she was daid! Her\\nheart hed quit beatin'. I'll swear to thet.”\\n\\n“I move to break camp,” said Shady Jones, gruffly, and he stood up. Moze\\nseconded that move by an expressive flash of his black visage.\\n\\n“Jim, if she's dead  an' gone  what 'n hell's come off?” huskily asked\\nAnson. “It, only seems thet way. We're all worked up... Let's talk\\nsense.”\\n\\n“Anson, shore there's a heap you an' me don't know,” replied Wilson.\\n“The world come to an end once. Wal, it can come to another end... I\\ntell you I ain't surprised  ”\\n\\n“THAR!” cried Anson, whirling, with his gun leaping out.\\n\\nSomething huge, shadowy, gray against the black rushed behind the men\\nand trees; and following it came a perceptible acceleration of the air.\\n\\n“Shore, Snake, there wasn't nothin',” said Wilson, “presently.”\\n\\n“I heerd,” whispered Shady Jones.\\n\\n“It was only a breeze blowin' thet smoke,” rejoined Moze.\\n\\n“I'd bet my soul somethin' went back of me,” declared Anson, glaring\\ninto the void.\\n\\n“Listen an' let's make shore,” suggested Wilson.\\n\\nThe guilty, agitated faces of the outlaws showed plain enough in the\\nflickering light for each to see a convicting dread in his fellow. Like\\nstatues they stood, watching and listening.\\n\\nFew sounds stirred in the strange silence. Now and then the horses\\nheaved heavily, but stood still; a dismal, dreary note of the wind in\\nthe pines vied with a hollow laugh of the brook. And these low sounds\\nonly fastened attention upon the quality of the silence. A breathing,\\nlonely spirit of solitude permeated the black dell. Like a pit of\\nunplumbed depths the dark night yawned. An evil conscience, listening\\nthere, could have heard the most peaceful, beautiful, and mournful\\nsounds of nature only as strains of a calling hell.\\n\\nSuddenly the silent, oppressive, surcharged air split to a short,\\npiercing scream.\\n\\nAnson's big horse stood up straight, pawing the air, and came down with\\na crash. The other horses shook with terror.\\n\\n“Wasn't  thet  a cougar?” whispered Anson, thickly.\\n\\n“Thet was a woman's scream,” replied Wilson, and he appeared to be\\nshaking like a leaf in the wind.\\n\\n“Then  I figgered right  the kid's alive  wonderin' around  an' she let\\nout thet orful scream,” said Anson.\\n\\n“Wonderin' 'round, yes  but she's daid!”\\n\\n“My Gawd! it ain't possible!”\\n\\n“Wal, if she ain't wonderin' round daid she's almost daid,” replied\\nWilson. And he began to whisper to himself.\\n\\n“If I'd only knowed what thet deal meant I'd hev plugged Beasley instead\\nof listenin'... An' I ought to hev knocked thet kid on the head an'\\nmade sartin she'd croaked. If she goes screamin' 'round thet way  ”\\n\\nHis voice failed as there rose a thin, splitting, high pointed shriek,\\nsomewhat resembling the first scream, only less wild. It came apparently\\nfrom the cliff.\\n\\nFrom another point in the pitch black glen rose the wailing, terrible\\ncry of a woman in agony. Wild, haunting, mournful wail!\\n\\nAnson's horse, loosing the halter, plunged back, almost falling over a\\nslight depression in the rocky ground. The outlaw caught him and dragged\\nhim nearer the fire. The other horses stood shaking and straining. Moze\\nran between them and held them. Shady Jones threw green brush on the\\nfire. With sputter and crackle a blaze started, showing Wilson standing\\ntragically, his arms out, facing the black shadows.\\n\\nThe strange, live shriek was not repeated. But the cry, like that of\\na woman in her death throes, pierced the silence again. It left a\\nquivering ring that softly died away. Then the stillness clamped down\\nonce more and the darkness seemed to thicken. The men waited, and when\\nthey had begun to relax the cry burst out appallingly close, right\\nbehind the trees. It was human  the personification of pain and\\nterror  the tremendous struggle of precious life against horrible death.\\nSo pure, so exquisite, so wonderful was the cry that the listeners\\nwrithed as if they saw an innocent, tender, beautiful girl torn\\nfrightfully before their eyes. It was full of suspense; it thrilled\\nfor death; its marvelous potency was the wild note  that beautiful and\\nghastly note of self preservation.\\n\\nIn sheer desperation the outlaw leader fired his gun at the black wall\\nwhence the cry came. Then he had to fight his horse to keep him from\\nplunging away. Following the shot was an interval of silence; the horses\\nbecame tractable; the men gathered closer to the fire, with the halters\\nstill held firmly.\\n\\n“If it was a cougar  thet 'd scare him off,” said Anson.\\n\\n“Shore, but it ain't a cougar,” replied Wilson. “Wait an' see!”\\n\\nThey all waited, listening with ears turned to different points, eyes\\nroving everywhere, afraid of their very shadows. Once more the moan of\\nwind, the mockery of brook, deep gurgle, laugh and babble, dominated the\\nsilence of the glen.\\n\\n“Boss, let's shake this spooky hole,” whispered Moze.\\n\\nThe suggestion attracted Anson, and he pondered it while slowly shaking\\nhis head.\\n\\n“We've only three hosses. An' mine 'll take ridin'  after them squalls,”\\n replied the leader. “We've got packs, too. An' hell 'ain't nothin' on\\nthis place fer bein' dark.”\\n\\n“No matter. Let's go. I'll walk an' lead the way,” said Moze, eagerly.\\n“I got sharp eyes. You fellars can ride an' carry a pack. We'll git out\\nof here an' come back in daylight fer the rest of the outfit.”\\n\\n“Anson, I'm keen fer thet myself,” declared Shady Jones.\\n\\n“Jim, what d'ye say to thet?” queried Anson. “Rustlin' out of this black\\nhole?”\\n\\n“Shore it's a grand idee,” agreed Wilson.\\n\\n“Thet was a cougar,” avowed Anson, gathering courage as the silence\\nremained unbroken. “But jest the same it was as tough on me as if it hed\\nbeen a woman screamin' over a blade twistin' in her gizzards.”\\n\\n“Snake, shore you seen a woman heah lately?” deliberately asked Wilson.\\n\\n“Reckon I did. Thet kid,” replied Anson, dubiously.\\n\\n“Wal, you seen her go crazy, didn't you?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“'An' she wasn't heah when you went huntin' fer her?”\\n\\n“Correct.”\\n\\n“Wal, if thet's so, what do you want to blab about cougars for?”\\n\\nWilson's argument seemed incontestable. Shady and Moze nodded gloomily\\nand shifted restlessly from foot to foot. Anson dropped his head.\\n\\n“No matter  if we only don't hear  ” he began, suddenly to grow mute.\\n\\nRight upon them, from some place, just out the circle of light, rose a\\nscream, by reason of its proximity the most piercing and agonizing yet\\nheard, simply petrifying the group until the peal passed. Anson's huge\\nhorse reared, and with a snort of terror lunged in tremendous leap,\\nstraight out. He struck Anson with thudding impact, knocking him over\\nthe rocks into the depression back of the camp fire, and plunging after\\nhim. Wilson had made a flying leap just in time to avoid being struck,\\nand he turned to see Anson go down. There came a crash, a groan, and\\nthen the strike and pound of hoofs as the horse struggled up. Apparently\\nhe had rolled over his master.\\n\\n“Help, fellars!” yelled Wilson, quick to leap down over the little bank,\\nand in the dim light to grasp the halter. The three men dragged the\\nhorse out and securely tied him close to a tree. That done, they\\npeered down into the depression. Anson's form could just barely be\\ndistinguished in the gloom. He lay stretched out. Another groan escaped\\nhim.\\n\\n“Shore I'm scared he's hurt,” said Wilson.\\n\\n“Hoss rolled right on top of him. An' thet hoss's heavy,” declared Moze.\\n\\nThey got down and knelt beside their leader. In the darkness his face\\nlooked dull gray. His breathing was not right.\\n\\n“Snake, old man, you ain't  hurt?” asked Wilson, with a tremor in his\\nvoice. Receiving no reply, he said to his comrades, “Lay hold an' we'll\\nheft him up where we can see.”\\n\\nThe three men carefully lifted Anson up on the bank and laid him near\\nthe fire in the light. Anson was conscious. His face was ghastly. Blood\\nshowed on his lips.\\n\\nWilson knelt beside him. The other outlaws stood up, and with one dark\\ngaze at one another damned Anson's chance of life. And on the instant\\nrose that terrible distressing scream of acute agony  like that of a\\nwoman being dismembered. Shady Jones whispered something to Moze. Then\\nthey stood up, gazing down at their fallen leader.\\n\\n“Tell me where you're hurt?” asked Wilson.\\n\\n“He  smashed  my chest,” said Anson, in a broken, strangled whisper.\\n\\nWilson's deft hands opened the outlaw's shirt and felt of his chest.\\n\\n“No. Shore your breast bone ain't smashed,” replied Wilson, hopefully.\\nAnd he began to run his hand around one side of Anson's body and then\\nthe other. Abruptly he stopped, averted his gaze, then slowly ran the\\nhand all along that side. Anson's ribs had been broken and crushed in\\nby the weight of the horse. He was bleeding at the mouth, and his slow,\\npainful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth, which showed that\\nthe broken bones had penetrated the lungs. An injury sooner or later\\nfatal!\\n\\n“Pard, you busted a rib or two,” said Wilson.\\n\\n“Aw, Jim  it must be  wuss 'n thet!” he whispered. “I'm  in orful  pain.\\nAn' I can't  git any  breath.”\\n\\n“Mebbe you'll be better,” said Wilson, with a cheerfulness his face\\nbelied.\\n\\nMoze bent close over Anson, took a short scrutiny of that ghastly face,\\nat the blood stained lips, and the lean hands plucking at nothing. Then\\nhe jerked erect.\\n\\n“Shady, he's goin' to cash. Let's clear out of this.”\\n\\n“I'm yours pertickler previous,” replied Jones.\\n\\nBoth turned away. They untied the two horses and led them up to where\\nthe saddles lay. Swiftly the blankets went on, swiftly the saddles\\nswung up, swiftly the cinches snapped. Anson lay gazing up at Wilson,\\ncomprehending this move. And Wilson stood strangely grim and silent,\\nsomehow detached coldly from that self of the past few hours.\\n\\n“Shady, you grab some bread an' I'll pack a bunk of meat,” said Moze.\\nBoth men came near the fire, into the light, within ten feet of where\\nthe leader lay.\\n\\n“Fellars  you ain't  slopin'?” he whispered, in husky amaze.\\n\\n“Boss, we air thet same. We can't do you no good an' this hole ain't\\nhealthy,” replied Moze.\\n\\nShady Jones swung himself astride his horse, all about him sharp, eager,\\nstrung.\\n\\n“Moze, I'll tote the grub an' you lead out of hyar, till we git past the\\nwust timber,” he said.\\n\\n“Aw, Moze  you wouldn't leave  Jim hyar  alone,” implored Anson.\\n\\n“Jim can stay till he rots,” retorted Moze. “I've hed enough of this\\nhole.”\\n\\n“But, Moze  it ain't square  ” panted Anson. “Jim wouldn't  leave me.\\nI'd stick  by you... I'll make it  all up to you.”\\n\\n“Snake, you're goin' to cash,” sardonically returned Moze.\\n\\nA current leaped all through Anson's stretched frame. His ghastly face\\nblazed. That was the great and the terrible moment which for long had\\nbeen in abeyance. Wilson had known grimly that it would come, by one\\nmeans or another. Anson had doggedly and faithfully struggled against\\nthe tide of fatal issues. Moze and Shady Jones, deep locked in their\\nself centered motives, had not realized the inevitable trend of their\\ndark lives.\\n\\nAnson, prostrate as he was, swiftly drew his gun and shot Moze. Without\\nsound or movement of hand Moze fell. Then the plunge of Shady's horse\\ncaused Anson's second shot to miss. A quick third shot brought no\\napparent result but Shady's cursing resort to his own weapon. He tried\\nto aim from his plunging horse. His bullets spattered dust and gravel\\nover Anson. Then Wilson's long arm stretched and his heavy gun banged.\\nShady collapsed in the saddle, and the frightened horse, throwing him,\\nplunged out of the circle of light. Thudding hoofs, crashings of brush,\\nquickly ceased.\\n\\n“Jim  did you  git him?” whispered Anson.\\n\\n“Shore did, Snake,” was the slow, halting response. Jim Wilson must have\\nsustained a sick shudder as he replied. Sheathing his gun, he folded a\\nblanket and put it under Anson's head.\\n\\n“Jim  my feet  air orful cold,” whispered Anson.\\n\\n“Wal, it's gittin' chilly,” replied Wilson, and, taking a second\\nblanket, he laid that over Anson's limbs. “Snake, I'm feared Shady hit\\nyou once.”\\n\\n“A huh! But not so I'd care  much  if I hed  no wuss hurt.”\\n\\n“You lay still now. Reckon Shady's hoss stopped out heah a ways. An'\\nI'll see.”\\n\\n“Jim  I 'ain't heerd  thet scream fer  a little.”\\n\\n“Shore it's gone... Reckon now thet was a cougar.”\\n\\n“I knowed it!”\\n\\nWilson stalked away into the darkness. That inky wall did not seem so\\nimpenetrable and black after he had gotten out of the circle of light.\\nHe proceeded carefully and did not make any missteps. He groped from\\ntree to tree toward the cliff and presently brought up against a huge\\nflat rock as high as his head. Here the darkness was blackest, yet he\\nwas able to see a light form on the rock.\\n\\n“Miss, are you there  all right?” he called, softly.\\n\\n“Yes, but I'm scared to death,” she whispered in reply.\\n\\n“Shore it wound up sudden. Come now. I reckon your trouble's over.”\\n\\nHe helped her off the rock, and, finding her unsteady on her feet, he\\nsupported her with one arm and held the other out in front of him to\\nfeel for objects. Foot by foot they worked out from under the dense\\nshadow of the cliff, following the course of the little brook. It\\nbabbled and gurgled, and almost drowned the low whistle Wilson sent out.\\nThe girl dragged heavily upon him now, evidently weakening. At length he\\nreached the little open patch at the head of the ravine. Halting here,\\nhe whistled. An answer came from somewhere behind him and to the right.\\nWilson waited, with the girl hanging on his arm.\\n\\n“Dale's heah,” he said. “An' don't you keel over now  after all the\\nnerve you hed.”\\n\\nA swishing of brush, a step, a soft, padded footfall; a looming, dark\\nfigure, and a long, low gray shape, stealthily moving  it was the last\\nof these that made Wilson jump.\\n\\n“Wilson!” came Dale's subdued voice.\\n\\n“Heah. I've got her, Dale. Safe an sound,” replied Wilson, stepping\\ntoward the tall form. And he put the drooping girl into Dale's arms.\\n\\n“Bo! Bo! You're all right?” Dale's deep voice was tremulous.\\n\\nShe roused up to seize him and to utter little cries of joy\\n\\n“Oh, Dale!... Oh, thank Heaven! I'm ready to drop now... Hasn't it been\\na night  an adventure?... I'm well  safe  sound... Dale, we owe it to\\nthis Jim Wilson.”\\n\\n“Bo, I  we'll all thank him  all our lives,” replied Dale. “Wilson,\\nyou're a man!... If you'll shake that gang  ”\\n\\n“Dale, shore there ain't much of a gang left, onless you let Burt git\\naway,” replied Wilson.\\n\\n“I didn't kill him  or hurt him. But I scared him so I'll bet he's\\nrunnin' yet... Wilson, did all the shootin' mean a fight?”\\n\\n“Tolerable.”\\n\\n“Oh, Dale, it was terrible! I saw it all. I  ”\\n\\n“Wal, Miss, you can tell him after I go... I'm wishin' you good luck.”\\n\\nHis voice was a cool, easy drawl, slightly tremulous.\\n\\nThe girl's face flashed white in the gloom. She pressed against the\\noutlaw  wrung his hands.\\n\\n“Heaven help you, Jim Wilson! You ARE from Texas!... I'll remember\\nyou  pray for you all my life!”\\n\\nWilson moved away, out toward the pale glow of light under the black\\npines.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\nAs Helen Rayner watched Dale ride away on a quest perilous to him, and\\nwhich meant almost life or death for her, it was surpassing strange that\\nshe could think of nothing except the thrilling, tumultuous moment when\\nshe had put her arms round his neck.\\n\\nIt did not matter that Dale  splendid fellow that he was  had made\\nthe ensuing moment free of shame by taking her action as he had taken\\nit  the fact that she had actually done it was enough. How utterly\\nimpossible for her to anticipate her impulses or to understand them,\\nonce they were acted upon! Confounding realization then was that when\\nDale returned with her sister, Helen knew she would do the same thing\\nover again!\\n\\n“If I do  I won't be two faced about it,” she soliloquized, and a hot\\nblush flamed her cheeks.\\n\\nShe watched Dale until he rode out of sight.\\n\\nWhen he had gone, worry and dread replaced this other confusing emotion.\\nShe turned to the business of meeting events. Before supper she packed\\nher valuables and books, papers, and clothes, together with Bo's, and\\nhad them in readiness so if she was forced to vacate the premises she\\nwould have her personal possessions.\\n\\nThe Mormon boys and several other of her trusted men slept in their\\ntarpaulin beds on the porch of the ranch house that night, so that Helen\\nat least would not be surprised. But the day came, with its manifold\\nduties undisturbed by any event. And it passed slowly with the leaden\\nfeet of listening, watching vigilance.\\n\\nCarmichael did not come back, nor was there news of him to be had. The\\nlast known of him had been late the afternoon of the preceding day, when\\na sheep herder had seen him far out on the north range, headed for the\\nhills. The Beemans reported that Roy's condition had improved, and also\\nthat there was a subdued excitement of suspense down in the village.\\n\\nThis second lonely night was almost unendurable for Helen. When she\\nslept it was to dream horrible dreams; when she lay awake it was to have\\nher heart leap to her throat at a rustle of leaves near the window, and\\nto be in torture of imagination as to poor Bo's plight. A thousand times\\nHelen said to herself that Beasley could have had the ranch and welcome,\\nif only Bo had been spared. Helen absolutely connected her enemy with\\nher sister's disappearance. Riggs might have been a means to it.\\n\\nDaylight was not attended by so many fears; there were things to do\\nthat demanded attention. And thus it was that the next morning, shortly\\nbefore noon, she was recalled to her perplexities by a shouting out at\\nthe corrals and a galloping of horses somewhere near. From the window\\nshe saw a big smoke.\\n\\n“Fire! That must be one of the barns  the old one, farthest out,”\\n she said, gazing out of the window. “Some careless Mexican with his\\neverlasting cigarette!”\\n\\nHelen resisted an impulse to go out and see what had happened. She had\\ndecided to stay in the house. But when footsteps sounded on the porch\\nand a rap on the door, she unhesitatingly opened it. Four Mexicans stood\\nclose. One of them, quick as thought, flashed a hand in to grasp her,\\nand in a single motion pulled her across the threshold.\\n\\n“No hurt, Senora,” he said, and pointed  making motions she must go.\\n\\nHelen did not need to be told what this visit meant. Many as her\\nconjectures had been, however, she had not thought of Beasley subjecting\\nher to this outrage. And her blood boiled.\\n\\n“How dare you!” she said, trembling in her effort to control her temper.\\nBut class, authority, voice availed nothing with these swarthy Mexicans.\\nThey grinned. Another laid hold of Helen with dirty, brown hand. She\\nshrank from the contact.\\n\\n“Let go!” she burst out, furiously. And instinctively she began to\\nstruggle to free herself. Then they all took hold of her. Helen's\\ndignity might never have been! A burning, choking rush of blood was\\nher first acquaintance with the terrible passion of anger that was her\\ninheritance from the Auchinclosses. She who had resolved never to lay\\nherself open to indignity now fought like a tigress. The Mexicans,\\njabbering in their excitement, had all they could do, until they\\nlifted her bodily from the porch. They handled her as if she had been a\\nhalf empty sack of corn. One holding each hand and foot they packed her,\\nwith dress disarranged and half torn off, down the path to the lane and\\ndown the lane to the road. There they stood upright and pushed her off\\nher property.\\n\\nThrough half blind eyes Helen saw them guarding the gateway, ready to\\nprevent her entrance. She staggered down the road to the village.\\nIt seemed she made her way through a red dimness  that there was a\\ncongestion in her brain  that the distance to Mrs. Cass's cottage was\\ninsurmountable. But she got there, to stagger up the path, to hear the\\nold woman's cry. Dizzy, faint, sick, with a blackness enveloping all she\\nlooked at, Helen felt herself led into the sitting room and placed in\\nthe big chair.\\n\\nPresently sight and clearness of mind returned to her. She saw Roy,\\nwhite as a sheet, questioning her with terrible eyes. The old woman\\nhung murmuring over her, trying to comfort her as well as fasten the\\ndisordered dress.\\n\\n“Four greasers  packed me down  the hill  threw me off my ranch  into\\nthe road!” panted Helen.\\n\\nShe seemed to tell this also to her own consciousness and to realize the\\nmighty wave of danger that shook her whole body.\\n\\n“If I'd known  I would have killed them!”\\n\\nShe exclaimed that, full voiced and hard, with dry, hot eyes on her\\nfriends. Roy reached out to take her hand, speaking huskily. Helen\\ndid not distinguish what he said. The frightened old woman knelt, with\\nunsteady fingers fumbling over the rents in Helen's dress. The moment\\ncame when Helen's quivering began to subside, when her blood quieted\\nto let her reason sway, when she began to do battle with her rage, and\\nslowly to take fearful stock of this consuming peril that had been a\\nsleeping tigress in her veins.\\n\\n“Oh, Miss Helen, you looked so turrible, I made sure you was hurted,”\\n the old woman was saying.\\n\\nHelen gazed strangely at her bruised wrists, at the one stocking that\\nhung down over her shoe top, at the rent which had bared her shoulder to\\nthe profane gaze of those grinning, beady eyed Mexicans.\\n\\n“My body's  not hurt,” she whispered.\\n\\nRoy had lost some of his whiteness, and where his eyes had been fierce\\nthey were now kind.\\n\\n“Wal, Miss Nell, it's lucky no harm's done... Now if you'll only see\\nthis whole deal clear!... Not let it spoil your sweet way of lookin' an'\\nhopin'! If you can only see what's raw in this West  an' love it jest\\nthe same!”\\n\\nHelen only half divined his meaning, but that was enough for a future\\nreflection. The West was beautiful, but hard. In the faces of these\\nfriends she began to see the meaning of the keen, sloping lines, and\\nshadows of pain, of a lean, naked truth, cut as from marble.\\n\\n“For the land's sakes, tell us all about it,” importuned Mrs. Cass.\\n\\nWhereupon Helen shut her eyes and told the brief narrative of her\\nexpulsion from her home.\\n\\n“Shore we all expected thet,” said Roy. “An' it's jest as well you're\\nhere with a whole skin. Beasley's in possession now an' I reckon we'd\\nall sooner hev you away from thet ranch.”\\n\\n“But, Roy, I won't let Beasley stay there,” cried Helen.\\n\\n“Miss Nell, shore by the time this here Pine has growed big enough fer\\nlaw you'll hev gray in thet pretty hair. You can't put Beasley off with\\nyour honest an' rightful claim. Al Auchincloss was a hard driver. He\\nmade enemies an' he made some he didn't kill. The evil men do lives\\nafter them. An' you've got to suffer fer Al's sins, though Al was as\\ngood as any man who ever prospered in these parts.”\\n\\n“Oh, what can I do? I won't give up. I've been robbed. Can't the people\\nhelp me? Must I meekly sit with my hands crossed while that half breed\\nthief  Oh, it's unbelievable!”\\n\\n“I reckon you'll jest hev to be patient fer a few days,” said Roy,\\ncalmly. “It'll all come right in the end.”\\n\\n“Roy! You've had this deal, as you call it, all worked out in mind for a\\nlong time!” exclaimed Helen.\\n\\n“Shore, an' I 'ain't missed a reckonin' yet.”\\n\\n“Then what will happen  in a few days?”\\n\\n“Nell Rayner, are you goin' to hev some spunk an' not lose your nerve\\nagain or go wild out of your head?”\\n\\n“I'll try to be brave, but  but I must be prepared,” she replied,\\ntremulously.\\n\\n“Wal, there's Dale an' Las Vegas an' me fer Beasley to reckon with.\\nAn', Miss Nell, his chances fer long life are as pore as his chances fer\\nheaven!”\\n\\n“But, Roy, I don't believe in deliberate taking of life,” replied\\nHelen, shuddering. “That's against my religion. I won't allow it...\\nAnd  then  think, Dale, all of you  in danger!”\\n\\n“Girl, how 're you ever goin' to help yourself? Shore you might hold\\nDale back, if you love him, an' swear you won't give yourself to him...\\nAn' I reckon I'd respect your religion, if you was goin' to suffer\\nthrough me... But not Dale nor you  nor Bo  nor love or heaven or hell\\ncan ever stop thet cowboy Las Vegas!”\\n\\n“Oh, if Dale brings Bo back to me  what will I care for my ranch?”\\n murmured Helen.\\n\\n“Reckon you'll only begin to care when thet happens. Your big hunter has\\ngot to be put to work,” replied Roy, with his keen smile.\\n\\n\\nBefore noon that day the baggage Helen had packed at home was left on\\nthe porch of Widow Cass's cottage, and Helen's anxious need of the hour\\nwas satisfied. She was made comfortable in the old woman's one spare\\nroom, and she set herself the task of fortitude and endurance.\\n\\nTo her surprise, many of Mrs. Cass's neighbors came unobtrusively to\\nthe back door of the little cottage and made sympathetic inquiries. They\\nappeared a subdued and apprehensive group, and whispered to one another\\nas they left. Helen gathered from their visits a conviction that the\\nwives of the men dominated by Beasley believed no good could come of\\nthis high handed taking over of the ranch. Indeed, Helen found at the\\nend of the day that a strength had been borne of her misfortune.\\n\\nThe next day Roy informed her that his brother John had come down the\\npreceding night with the news of Beasley's descent upon the ranch. Not a\\nshot had been fired, and the only damage done was that of the burning of\\na hay filled barn. This had been set on fire to attract Helen's men to\\none spot, where Beasley had ridden down upon them with three times their\\nnumber. He had boldly ordered them off the land, unless they wanted to\\nacknowledge him boss and remain there in his service. The three Beemans\\nhad stayed, having planned that just in this event they might be\\nvaluable to Helen's interests. Beasley had ridden down into Pine the\\nsame as upon any other day. Roy reported also news which had come in\\nthat morning, how Beasley's crowd had celebrated late the night before.\\n\\nThe second and third and fourth days endlessly wore away, and Helen\\nbelieved they had made her old. At night she lay awake most of the time,\\nthinking and praying, but during the afternoon she got some sleep. She\\ncould think of nothing and talk of nothing except her sister, and Dale's\\nchances of saving her.\\n\\n“Well, shore you pay Dale a pore compliment,” finally protested the\\npatient Roy. “I tell you  Milt Dale can do anythin' he wants to do in\\nthe woods. You can believe thet. ... But I reckon he'll run chances\\nafter he comes back.”\\n\\nThis significant speech thrilled Helen with its assurance of hope, and\\nmade her blood curdle at the implied peril awaiting the hunter.\\n\\nOn the afternoon of the fifth day Helen was abruptly awakened from her\\nnap. The sun had almost set. She heard voices  the shrill, cackling\\nnotes of old Mrs. Cass, high in excitement, a deep voice that made Helen\\ntingle all over, a girl's laugh, broken but happy. There were footsteps\\nand stamping of hoofs. Dale had brought Bo back! Helen knew it. She grew\\nvery weak, and had to force herself to stand erect. Her heart began to\\npound in her very ears. A sweet and perfect joy suddenly flooded her\\nsoul. She thanked God her prayers had been answered. Then suddenly alive\\nwith sheer mad physical gladness, she rushed out.\\n\\nShe was just in time to see Roy Beeman stalk out as if he had never been\\nshot, and with a yell greet a big, gray clad, gray faced man  Dale.\\n\\n“Howdy, Roy! Glad to see you up,” said Dale. How the quiet voice\\nsteadied Helen! She beheld Bo. Bo, looking the same, except a little\\npale and disheveled! Then Bo saw her and leaped at her, into her arms.\\n\\n“Nell! I'm here! Safe  all right! Never was so happy in my life...\\nOh h! talk about your adventures! Nell, you dear old mother to me  I've\\nhad e enough forever!”\\n\\nBo was wild with joy, and by turns she laughed and cried. But Helen\\ncould not voice her feelings. Her eyes were so dim that she could\\nscarcely see Dale when he loomed over her as she held Bo. But he found\\nthe hand she put shakily out.\\n\\n“Nell!... Reckon it's been harder  on you.” His voice was earnest and\\nhalting. She felt his searching gaze upon her face. “Mrs. Cass said you\\nwere here. An' I know why.”\\n\\nRoy led them all indoors.\\n\\n“Milt, one of the neighbor boys will take care of thet hoss,” he said,\\nas Dale turned toward the dusty and weary Ranger. “Where'd you leave the\\ncougar?”\\n\\n“I sent him home,” replied Date.\\n\\n“Laws now, Milt, if this ain't grand!” cackled Mrs. Cass. “We've worried\\nsome here. An' Miss Helen near starved a hopin' fer you.”\\n\\n“Mother, I reckon the girl an' I are nearer starved than anybody you\\nknow,” replied Dale, with a grim laugh.\\n\\n“Fer the land's sake! I'll be fixin' supper this minit.”\\n\\n“Nell, why are you here?” asked Bo, suspiciously.\\n\\nFor answer Helen led her sister into the spare room and closed the door.\\nBo saw the baggage. Her expression changed. The old blaze leaped to the\\ntelltale eyes.\\n\\n“He's done it!” she cried, hotly.\\n\\n“Dearest  thank God. I've got you  back again!” murmured Helen, finding\\nher voice. “Nothing else matters!... I've prayed only for that!”\\n\\n“Good old Nell!” whispered Bo, and she kissed and embraced Helen. “You\\nreally mean that, I know. But nix for yours truly! I'm back alive and\\nkicking, you bet... Where's my  where's Tom?”\\n\\n“Bo, not a word has been heard of him for five days. He's searching for\\nyou, of course.”\\n\\n“And you've been  been put off the ranch?”\\n\\n“Well, rather,” replied Helen, and in a few trembling words she told the\\nstory of her eviction.\\n\\nBo uttered a wild word that had more force than elegance, but it became\\nher passionate resentment of this outrage done her sister.\\n\\n“Oh!... Does Tom Carmichael know this?” she added, breathlessly.\\n\\n“How could he?”\\n\\n“When he finds out, then  Oh, won't there be hell? I'm glad I got here\\nfirst... Nell, my boots haven't been off the whole blessed time. Help\\nme. And oh, for some soap and hot water and some clean clothes! Nell,\\nold girl, I wasn't raised right for these Western deals. Too luxurious!”\\n\\nAnd then Helen had her ears filled with a rapid fire account of running\\nhorses and Riggs and outlaws and Beasley called boldly to his teeth, and\\na long ride and an outlaw who was a hero  a fight with Riggs  blood and\\ndeath  another long ride  a wild camp in black woods  night  lonely,\\nghostly sounds  and day again  plot  a great actress lost to the\\nworld  Ophelia  Snakes and Ansons  hoodooed outlaws  mournful moans\\nand terrible cries  cougar  stampede  fight and shots, more blood and\\ndeath  Wilson hero  another Tom Carmichael  fallen in love with outlaw\\ngun fighter if  black night and Dale and horse and rides and starved\\nand, “Oh, Nell, he WAS from Texas!”\\n\\nHelen gathered that wonderful and dreadful events had hung over\\nthe bright head of this beloved little sister, but the bewilderment\\noccasioned by Bo's fluent and remarkable utterance left only that last\\nsentence clear.\\n\\nPresently Helen got a word in to inform Bo that Mrs. Cass had knocked\\ntwice for supper, and that welcome news checked Bo's flow of speech when\\nnothing else seemed adequate.\\n\\nIt was obvious to Helen that Roy and Dale had exchanged stories. Roy\\ncelebrated this reunion by sitting at table the first time since he\\nhad been shot; and despite Helen's misfortune and the suspended waiting\\nbalance in the air the occasion was joyous. Old Mrs. Cass was in the\\nheight of her glory. She sensed a romance here, and, true to her sex,\\nshe radiated to it.\\n\\nDaylight was still lingering when Roy got up and went out on the porch.\\nHis keen ears had heard something. Helen fancied she herself had heard\\nrapid hoof beats.\\n\\n“Dale, come out!” called Roy, sharply.\\n\\nThe hunter moved with his swift, noiseless agility. Helen and Bo\\nfollowed, halting in the door.\\n\\n“Thet's Las Vegas,” whispered Dale.\\n\\nTo Helen it seemed that the cowboy's name changed the very atmosphere.\\n\\nVoices were heard at the gate; one that, harsh and quick, sounded like\\nCarmichael's. And a spirited horse was pounding and scattering\\ngravel. Then a lithe figure appeared, striding up the path. It was\\nCarmichael  yet not the Carmichael Helen knew. She heard Bo's strange\\nlittle cry, a corroboration of her own impression.\\n\\nRoy might never have been shot, judging from the way he stepped out,\\nand Dale was almost as quick. Carmichael reached them  grasped them with\\nswift, hard hands.\\n\\n“Boys  I jest rode in. An' they said you'd found her!”\\n\\n“Shore, Las Vegas. Dale fetched her home safe an' sound... There she\\nis.”\\n\\nThe cowboy thrust aside the two men, and with a long stride he faced the\\nporch, his piercing eyes on the door. All that Helen could think of his\\nlook was that it seemed terrible. Bo stepped outside in front of Helen.\\nProbably she would have run straight into Carmichael's arms if some\\nstrange instinct had not withheld her. Helen judged it to be fear; she\\nfound her heart lifting painfully.\\n\\n“Bo!” he yelled, like a savage, yet he did not in the least resemble\\none.\\n\\n“Oh  Tom!” cried Bo, falteringly. She half held out her arms.\\n\\n“You, girl?” That seemed to be his piercing query, like the quivering\\nblade in his eyes. Two more long strides carried him close up to her,\\nand his look chased the red out of Bo's cheek. Then it was beautiful to\\nsee his face marvelously change until it was that of the well remembered\\nLas Vegas magnified in all his old spirit.\\n\\n“Aw!” The exclamation was a tremendous sigh. “I shore am glad!”\\n\\nThat beautiful flash left his face as he wheeled to the men. He wrung\\nDale's hand long and hard, and his gaze confused the older man.\\n\\n“RIGGS!” he said, and in the jerk of his frame as he whipped out the\\nword disappeared the strange, fleeting signs of his kindlier emotion.\\n\\n“Wilson killed him,” replied Dale.\\n\\n“Jim Wilson  that old Texas Ranger!... Reckon he lent you a hand?”\\n\\n“My friend, he saved Bo,” replied Dale, with emotion. “My old cougar an'\\nme  we just hung 'round.”\\n\\n“You made Wilson help you?” cut in the hard voice.\\n\\n“Yes. But he killed Riggs before I come up an' I reckon he'd done well\\nby Bo if I'd never got there.”\\n\\n“How about the gang?”\\n\\n“All snuffed out, I reckon, except Wilson.”\\n\\n“Somebody told me Beasley hed ran Miss Helen off the ranch. Thet so?”\\n\\n“Yes. Four of his greasers packed her down the hill  most tore her\\nclothes off, so Roy tells me.”\\n\\n“Four greasers!... Shore it was Beasley's deal clean through?”\\n\\n“Yes. Riggs was led. He had an itch for a bad name, you know. But\\nBeasley made the plan. It was Nell they wanted instead of Bo.”\\n\\nAbruptly Carmichael stalked off down the darkening path, his silver\\nheel plates ringing, his spurs jingling.\\n\\n“Hold on, Carmichael,” called Dale, taking a step.\\n\\n“Oh, Tom!” cried Bo.\\n\\n“Shore folks callin' won't be no use, if anythin would be,” said Roy.\\n“Las Vegas has hed a look at red liquor.”\\n\\n“He's been drinking! Oh, that accounts!... he never  never even touched\\nme!”\\n\\nFor once Helen was not ready to comfort Bo. A mighty tug at her heart\\nhad sent her with flying, uneven steps toward Dale. He took another\\nstride down the path, and another.\\n\\n“Dale  oh  please stop!” she called, very low.\\n\\nHe halted as if he had run sharply into a bar across the path. When he\\nturned Helen had come close. Twilight was deep there in the shade of the\\npeach trees, but she could see his face, the hungry, flaring eyes.\\n\\n“I  I haven't thanked you  yet  for bringing Bo home,” she whispered.\\n\\n“Nell, never mind that,” he said, in surprise. “If you must  why, wait.\\nI've got to catch up with that cowboy.”\\n\\n“No. Let me thank you now,” she whispered, and, stepping closer, she put\\nher arms up, meaning to put them round his neck. That action must be her\\nself punishment for the other time she had done it. Yet it might also\\nserve to thank him. But, strangely, her hands got no farther than his\\nbreast, and fluttered there to catch hold of the fringe of his buckskin\\njacket. She felt a heave of his deep chest.\\n\\n“I  I do thank you  with all my heart,” she said, softly. “I owe you\\nnow  for myself and her  more than I can ever repay.”\\n\\n“Nell, I'm your friend,” he replied, hurriedly. “Don't talk of repayin'\\nme. Let me go now  after Las Vegas.”\\n\\n“What for?” she queried, suddenly.\\n\\n“I mean to line up beside him  at the bar  or wherever he goes,”\\n returned Dale.\\n\\n“Don't tell me that. I know. You're going straight to meet Beasley.”\\n\\n“Nell, if you hold me up any longer I reckon I'll have to run  or never\\nget to Beasley before that cowboy.”\\n\\nHelen locked her fingers in the fringe of his jacket  leaned closer to\\nhim, all her being responsive to a bursting gust of blood over her.\\n\\n“I'll not let you go,” she said.\\n\\nHe laughed, and put his great hands over hers. “What 're you sayin',\\ngirl? You can't stop me.”\\n\\n“Yes, I can. Dale, I don't want you to risk your life.”\\n\\nHe stared at her, and made as if to tear her hands from their hold.\\n\\n“Listen  please  oh  please!” she implored. “If you go deliberately\\nto kill Beasley  and do it  that will be murder... It's against my\\nreligion... I would be unhappy all my life.”\\n\\n“But, child, you'll be ruined all your life if Beasley is not dealt\\nwith  as men of his breed are always dealt with in the West,” he\\nremonstrated, and in one quick move he had freed himself from her\\nclutching fingers.\\n\\nHelen, with a move as swift, put her arms round his neck and clasped her\\nhands tight.\\n\\n“Milt, I'm finding myself,” she said. “The other day, when I\\ndid  this  you made an excuse for me... I'm not two faced now.”\\n\\nShe meant to keep him from killing Beasley if she sacrificed every last\\nshred of her pride. And she stamped the look of his face on her heart\\nof hearts to treasure always. The thrill, the beat of her pulses, almost\\nobstructed her thought of purpose.\\n\\n“Nell, just now  when you're overcome  rash with feelin's  don't say to\\nme  a word  a  ”\\n\\nHe broke down huskily.\\n\\n“My first friend  my  Oh Dale, I KNOW you love me! she whispered. And\\nshe hid her face on his breast, there to feel a tremendous tumult.\\n\\n“Oh, don't you?” she cried, in low, smothered voice, as his silence\\ndrove her farther on this mad, yet glorious purpose.\\n\\n“If you need to be told  yes  I reckon I do love you, Nell Rayner,” he\\nreplied.\\n\\nIt seemed to Helen that he spoke from far off. She lifted her face, her\\nheart on her lips.\\n\\n“If you kill Beasley I'll never marry you,” she said.\\n\\n“Who's expectin' you to?” he asked, with low, hoarse laugh. “Do you\\nthink you have to marry me to square accounts? This's the only time you\\never hurt me, Nell Rayner... I'm 'shamed you could think I'd expect\\nyou  out of gratitude  ”\\n\\n“Oh  you  you are as dense as the forest where you live,” she cried.\\nAnd then she shut her eyes again, the better to remember that\\ntransfiguration of his face, the better to betray herself.\\n\\n“Man  I love you!” Full and deep, yet tremulous, the words burst from\\nher heart that had been burdened with them for many a day.\\n\\nThen it seemed, in the throbbing riot of her senses, that she was\\nlifted and swung into his arms, and handled with a great and terrible\\ntenderness, and hugged and kissed with the hunger and awkwardness of a\\nbear, and held with her feet off the ground, and rendered blind, dizzy,\\nrapturous, and frightened, and utterly torn asunder from her old calm,\\nthinking self.\\n\\nHe put her down  released her.\\n\\n“Nothin' could have made me so happy as what you said.” He finished with\\na strong sigh of unutterable, wondering joy.\\n\\n“Then you will not go to  to meet  ”\\n\\nHelen's happy query froze on her lips.\\n\\n“I've got to go!” he rejoined, with his old, quiet voice. “Hurry in to\\nBo... An' don't worry. Try to think of things as I taught you up in the\\nwoods.”\\n\\nHelen heard his soft, padded footfalls swiftly pass away. She was left\\nthere, alone in the darkening twilight, suddenly cold and stricken, as\\nif turned to stone.\\n\\nThus she stood an age long moment until the upflashing truth galvanized\\nher into action. Then she flew in pursuit of Dale. The truth was that,\\nin spite of Dale's' early training in the East and the long years of\\nsolitude which had made him wonderful in thought and feeling, he had\\nalso become a part of this raw, bold, and violent West.\\n\\nIt was quite dark now and she had run quite some distance before she saw\\nDale's tall, dark form against the yellow light of Turner's saloon.\\n\\nSomehow, in that poignant moment, when her flying feet kept pace with\\nher heart, Helen felt in herself a force opposing itself against this\\nraw, primitive justice of the West. She was one of the first influences\\nemanating from civilized life, from law and order. In that flash of\\ntruth she saw the West as it would be some future time, when through\\nwomen and children these wild frontier days would be gone forever. Also,\\njust as clearly she saw the present need of men like Roy Beeman and Dale\\nand the fire blooded Carmichael. Beasley and his kind must be killed.\\nBut Helen did not want her lover, her future husband, and the probable\\nfather of her children to commit what she held to be murder.\\n\\nAt the door of the saloon she caught up with Dale.\\n\\n“Milt  oh  wait!'  wait!” she panted.\\n\\nShe heard him curse under his breath as he turned. They were alone in\\nthe yellow flare of light. Horses were champing bits and drooping before\\nthe rails.\\n\\n“You go back!” ordered Dale, sternly. His face was pale, his eyes were\\ngleaming.\\n\\n“No! Not till  you take me  or carry me!” she replied, resolutely, with\\nall a woman's positive and inevitable assurance.\\n\\nThen he laid hold of her with ungentle hands. His violence, especially\\nthe look on his face, terrified Helen, rendered her weak. But nothing\\ncould have shaken her resolve. She felt victory. Her sex, her love, and\\nher presence would be too much for Dale.\\n\\nAs he swung Helen around, the low hum of voices inside the saloon\\nsuddenly rose to sharp, hoarse roars, accompanied by a scuffling of feet\\nand crashing of violently sliding chairs or tables. Dale let go of Helen\\nand leaped toward the door. But a silence inside, quicker and stranger\\nthan the roar, halted him. Helen's heart contracted, then seemed to\\ncease beating. There was absolutely not a perceptible sound. Even the\\nhorses appeared, like Dale, to have turned to statues.\\n\\nTwo thundering shots annihilated this silence. Then quickly came a\\nlighter shot  the smash of glass. Dale ran into the saloon. The horses\\nbegan to snort, to rear, to pound. A low, muffled murmur terrified Helen\\neven as it drew her. Dashing at the door, she swung it in and entered.\\n\\nThe place was dim, blue hazed, smelling of smoke. Dale stood just inside\\nthe door. On the floor lay two men. Chairs and tables were overturned.\\nA motley, dark, shirt sleeved, booted, and belted crowd of men appeared\\nhunched against the opposite wall, with pale, set faces, turned to the\\nbar. Turner, the proprietor, stood at one end, his face livid, his hands\\naloft and shaking. Carmichael leaned against the middle of the bar. He\\nheld a gun low down. It was smoking.\\n\\nWith a gasp Helen flashed her eyes back to Dale. He had seen her  was\\nreaching an arm toward her. Then she saw the man lying almost at her\\nfeet. Jeff Mulvey  her uncle's old foreman! His face was awful to\\nbehold. A smoking gun lay near his inert hand. The other man had fallen\\non his face. His garb proclaimed him a Mexican. He was not yet dead.\\nThen Helen, as she felt Dale's arm encircle her, looked farther, because\\nshe could not prevent it  looked on at that strange figure against the\\nbar  this boy who had been such a friend in her hour of need  this naive\\nand frank sweetheart of her sister's.\\n\\nShe saw a man now  wild, white, intense as fire, with some terrible cool\\nkind of deadliness in his mien. His left elbow rested upon the bar, and\\nhis hand held a glass of red liquor. The big gun, low down in his other\\nhand, seemed as steady as if it were a fixture.\\n\\n“Heah's to thet  half breed Beasley an' his outfit!”\\n\\nCarmichael drank, while his flaming eyes held the crowd; then with\\nsavage action of terrible passion he flung the glass at the quivering\\nform of the still living Mexican on the floor.\\n\\nHelen felt herself slipping. All seemed to darken around her. She could\\nnot see Dale, though she knew he held her. Then she fainted.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nLas Vegas Carmichael was a product of his day.\\n\\nThe Pan Handle of Texas, the old Chisholm Trail along which were\\ndriven the great cattle herds northward, Fort Dodge, where the cowboys\\nconflicted with the card sharps  these hard places had left their marks\\non Carmichael. To come from Texas was to come from fighting stock. And\\na cowboy's life was strenuous, wild, violent, and generally brief. The\\nexceptions were the fortunate and the swiftest men with guns; and they\\ndrifted from south to north and west, taking with them the reckless,\\nchivalrous, vitriolic spirit peculiar to their breed.\\n\\nThe pioneers and ranchers of the frontier would never have made the West\\nhabitable had it not been for these wild cowboys, these hard drinking,\\nhard riding, hard living rangers of the barrens, these easy, cool,\\nlaconic, simple young men whose blood was tinged with fire and who\\npossessed a magnificent and terrible effrontery toward danger and death.\\n\\nLas Vegas ran his horse from Widow Cass's cottage to Turner's saloon,\\nand the hoofs of the goaded steed crashed in the door. Las Vegas's\\nentrance was a leap. Then he stood still with the door ajar and the\\nhorse pounding and snorting back. All the men in that saloon who saw the\\nentrance of Las Vegas knew what it portended. No thunderbolt could\\nhave more quickly checked the drinking, gambling, talking crowd. They\\nrecognized with kindred senses the nature of the man and his arrival.\\nFor a second the blue hazed room was perfectly quiet, then men breathed,\\nmoved, rose, and suddenly caused a quick, sliding crash of chairs and\\ntables.\\n\\nThe cowboy's glittering eyes flashed to and fro, and then fixed on\\nMulvey and his Mexican companion. That glance singled out these two, and\\nthe sudden rush of nervous men proved it. Mulvey and the sheep herder\\nwere left alone in the center of the floor.\\n\\n“Howdy, Jeff! Where's your boss?” asked Las Vegas. His voice was cool,\\nfriendly; his manner was easy, natural; but the look of him was what\\nmade Mulvey pale and the Mexican livid.\\n\\n“Reckon he's home,” replied Mulvey.\\n\\n“Home? What's he call home now?”\\n\\n“He's hangin' out hyar at Auchincloss's,” replied Mulvey. His voice was\\nnot strong, but his eyes were steady, watchful.\\n\\nLas Vegas quivered all over as if stung. A flame that seemed white and\\nred gave his face a singular hue.\\n\\n“Jeff, you worked for old Al a long time, an' I've heard of your\\ndifferences,” said Las Vegas. “Thet ain't no mix of mine... But you\\ndouble crossed Miss Helen!”\\n\\nMulvey made no attempt to deny this. He gulped slowly. His hands\\nappeared less steady, and he grew paler. Again Las Vegas's words\\nsignified less than his look. And that look now included the Mexican.\\n\\n“Pedro, you're one of Beasley's old hands,” said Las Vegas, accusingly.\\n“An'  you was one of them four greasers thet  ”\\n\\nHere the cowboy choked and bit over his words as if they were a material\\npoison. The Mexican showed his guilt and cowardice. He began to jabber.\\n\\n“Shet up!” hissed Las Vegas, with a savage and significant jerk of\\nhis arm, as if about to strike. But that action was read for its true\\nmeaning. Pell mell the crowd split to rush each way and leave an open\\nspace behind the three.\\n\\nLas Vegas waited. But Mulvey seemed obstructed. The Mexican looked\\ndangerous through his fear. His fingers twitched as if the tendons\\nrunning up into his arms were being pulled.\\n\\nAn instant of suspense  more than long enough for Mulvey to be tried and\\nfound wanting  and Las Vegas, with laugh and sneer, turned his back upon\\nthe pair and stepped to the bar. His call for a bottle made Turner jump\\nand hold it out with shaking hands. Las Vegas poured out a drink, while\\nhis gaze was intent on the scarred old mirror hanging behind the bar.\\n\\nThis turning his back upon men he had just dared to draw showed what\\nkind of a school Las Vegas had been trained in. If those men had been\\nworthy antagonists of his class he would never have scorned them. As it\\nwas, when Mulvey and the Mexican jerked at their guns, Las Vegas swiftly\\nwheeled and shot twice. Mulvey's gun went off as he fell, and the\\nMexican doubled up in a heap on the floor. Then Las Vegas reached around\\nwith his left hand for the drink he had poured out.\\n\\nAt this juncture Dale burst into the saloon, suddenly to check his\\nimpetus, to swerve aside toward the bar and halt. The door had not\\nceased swinging when again it was propelled inward, this time to admit\\nHelen Rayner, white and wide eyed.\\n\\nIn another moment then Las Vegas had spoken his deadly toast to\\nBeasley's gang and had fiercely flung the glass at the writhing Mexican\\non the floor. Also Dale had gravitated toward the reeling Helen to catch\\nher when she fainted.\\n\\nLas Vegas began to curse, and, striding to Dale, he pushed him out of\\nthe saloon.\\n\\n“  ! What 're you doin' heah?” he yelled, stridently. “Hevn't you got\\nthet girl to think of? Then do it, you big Indian! Lettin' her run after\\nyou heah  riskin' herself thet way! You take care of her an' Bo an'\\nleave this deal to me!”\\n\\nThe cowboy, furious as he was at Dale, yet had keen, swift eyes for the\\nhorses near at hand, and the men out in the dim light. Dale lifted\\nthe girl into his arms, and, turning without a word, stalked away to\\ndisappear in the darkness. Las Vegas, holding his gun low, returned to\\nthe bar room. If there had been any change in the crowd it was slight.\\nThe tension had relaxed. Turner no longer stood with hands up.\\n\\n“You all go on with your fun,” called the cowboy, with a sweep of his\\ngun. “But it'd be risky fer any one to start leavin'.”\\n\\nWith that he backed against the bar, near where the black bottle stood.\\nTurner walked out to begin righting tables and chairs, and presently the\\ncrowd, with some caution and suspense, resumed their games and drinking.\\nIt was significant that a wide berth lay between them and the door. From\\ntime to time Turner served liquor to men who called for it.\\n\\nLas Vegas leaned with back against the bar. After a while he sheathed\\nhis gun and reached around for the bottle. He drank with his piercing\\neyes upon the door. No one entered and no one went out. The games\\nof chance there and the drinking were not enjoyed. It was a hard\\nscene  that smoky, long, ill smelling room, with its dim, yellow lights,\\nand dark, evil faces, with the stealthy stepping Turner passing to and\\nfro, and the dead Mulvey staring in horrible fixidity at the ceiling,\\nand the Mexican quivering more and more until he shook violently, then\\nlay still, and with the drinking, somber, waiting cowboy, more fiery and\\nmore flaming with every drink, listening for a step that did not come.\\n\\nTime passed, and what little change it wrought was in the cowboy. Drink\\naffected him, but he did not become drunk. It seemed that the liquor he\\ndrank was consumed by a mounting fire. It was fuel to a driving passion.\\nHe grew more sullen, somber, brooding, redder of eye and face, more\\ncrouching and restless. At last, when the hour was so late that there\\nwas no probability of Beasley appearing, Las Vegas flung himself out of\\nthe saloon.\\n\\nAll lights of the village had now been extinguished. The tired horses\\ndrooped in the darkness. Las Vegas found his horse and led him away down\\nthe road and out a lane to a field where a barn stood dim and dark in\\nthe starlight. Morning was not far off. He unsaddled the horse and,\\nturning him loose, went into the barn. Here he seemed familiar with\\nhis surroundings, for he found a ladder and climbed to a loft, where he\\nthrew himself on the hay.\\n\\nHe rested, but did not sleep. At daylight he went down and brought his\\nhorse into the barn. Sunrise found Las Vegas pacing to and fro the short\\nlength of the interior, and peering out through wide cracks between\\nthe boards. Then during the succeeding couple of hours he watched\\nthe occasional horseman and wagon and herder that passed on into the\\nvillage.\\n\\nAbout the breakfast hour Las Vegas saddled his horse and rode back the\\nway he had come the night before. At Turner's he called for something\\nto eat as well as for whisky. After that he became a listening, watching\\nmachine. He drank freely for an hour; then he stopped. He seemed to\\nbe drunk, but with a different kind of drunkenness from that usual in\\ndrinking men. Savage, fierce, sullen, he was one to avoid. Turner waited\\non him in evident fear.\\n\\nAt length Las Vegas's condition became such that action was involuntary.\\nHe could not stand still nor sit down. Stalking out, he passed the\\nstore, where men slouched back to avoid him, and he went down the road,\\nwary and alert, as if he expected a rifle shot from some hidden enemy.\\nUpon his return down that main thoroughfare of the village not a person\\nwas to be seen. He went in to Turner's. The proprietor was there at his\\npost, nervous and pale. Las Vegas did not order any more liquor.\\n\\n“Turner, I reckon I'll bore you next time I run in heah,” he said, and\\nstalked out.\\n\\nHe had the stores, the road, the village, to himself; and he patrolled a\\nbeat like a sentry watching for an Indian attack.\\n\\nToward noon a single man ventured out into the road to accost the\\ncowboy.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, I'm tellin' you  all the greasers air leavin' the range,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\n“Howdy, Abe!” replied Las Vegas. “What 'n hell you talkin' about?”\\n\\nThe man repeated his information. And Las Vegas spat out frightful\\ncurses.\\n\\n“Abe  you heah what Beasley's doin'?”\\n\\n“Yes. He's with his men  up at the ranch. Reckon he can't put off ridin'\\ndown much longer.”\\n\\nThat was where the West spoke. Beasley would be forced to meet the enemy\\nwho had come out single handed against him. Long before this hour a\\nbraver man would have come to face Las Vegas. Beasley could not hire\\nany gang to bear the brunt of this situation. This was the test by which\\neven his own men must judge him. All of which was to say that as the\\nwildness of the West had made possible his crimes, so it now held him\\nresponsible for them.\\n\\n“Abe, if thet  greaser don't rustle down heah I'm goin' after him.”\\n\\n“Sure. But don't be in no hurry,” replied Abe.\\n\\n“I'm waltzin' to slow music... Gimme a smoke.”\\n\\nWith fingers that slightly trembled Abe rolled a cigarette, lit it from\\nhis own, and handed it to the cowboy.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, I reckon I hear hosses,” he said, suddenly.\\n\\n“Me, too,” replied Las Vegas, with his head high like that of a\\nlistening deer. Apparently he forgot the cigarette and also his friend.\\nAbe hurried back to the store, where he disappeared.\\n\\nLas Vegas began his stalking up and down, and his action now was an\\nexaggeration of all his former movements. A rational, ordinary mortal\\nfrom some Eastern community, happening to meet this red faced cowboy,\\nwould have considered him drunk or crazy. Probably Las Vegas looked\\nboth. But all the same he was a marvelously keen and strung and\\nefficient instrument to meet the portending issue. How many thousands of\\ntimes, on the trails, and in the wide streeted little towns all over the\\nWest, had this stalk of the cowboy's been perpetrated! Violent, bloody,\\ntragic as it was, it had an importance in that pioneer day equal to the\\nuse of a horse or the need of a plow.\\n\\nAt length Pine was apparently a deserted village, except for Las Vegas,\\nwho patrolled his long beat in many ways  he lounged while he\\nwatched; he stalked like a mountaineer; he stole along Indian fashion,\\nstealthily, from tree to tree, from corner to corner; he disappeared in\\nthe saloon to reappear at the back; he slipped round behind the barns to\\ncome out again in the main road; and time after time he approached his\\nhorse as if deciding to mount.\\n\\nThe last visit he made into Turner's saloon he found no one there.\\nSavagely he pounded on the bar with his gun. He got no response. Then\\nthe long pent up rage burst. With wild whoops he pulled another gun and\\nshot at the mirror, the lamps. He shot the neck off a bottle and drank\\ntill he choked, his neck corded, bulging, and purple. His only slow and\\ndeliberate action was the reloading of his gun. Then he crashed through\\nthe doors, and with a wild yell leaped sheer into the saddle, hauling\\nhis horse up high and goading him to plunge away.\\n\\nMen running to the door and windows of the store saw a streak of dust\\nflying down the road. And then they trooped out to see it disappear. The\\nhour of suspense ended for them. Las Vegas had lived up to the code of\\nthe West, had dared his man out, had waited far longer than needful to\\nprove that man a coward. Whatever the issue now, Beasley was branded\\nforever. That moment saw the decline of whatever power he had wielded.\\nHe and his men might kill the cowboy who had ridden out alone to face\\nhim, but that would not change the brand.\\n\\nThe preceding night Beasley bad been finishing a late supper at his\\nnewly acquired ranch, when Buck Weaver, one of his men, burst in upon\\nhim with news of the death of Mulvey and Pedro.\\n\\n“Who's in the outfit? How many?” he had questioned, quickly.\\n\\n“It's a one man outfit, boss,” replied Weaver.\\n\\nBeasley appeared astounded. He and his men had prepared to meet the\\nfriends of the girl whose property he had taken over, and because of the\\nsuperiority of his own force he had anticipated no bloody or extended\\nfeud. This amazing circumstance put the case in very much more difficult\\nform.\\n\\n“One man!” he ejaculated.\\n\\n“Yep. Thet cowboy Las Vegas. An', boss, he turns out to be a gun slinger\\nfrom Texas. I was in Turner's. Hed jest happened to step in the other\\nroom when Las Vegas come bustin' in on his hoss an' jumped off... Fust\\nthing he called Jeff an' Pedro. They both showed yaller. An' then, damn\\nif thet cowboy didn't turn his back on them an' went to the bar fer a\\ndrink. But he was lookin' in the mirror an' when Jeff an' Pedro went fer\\ntheir guns why he whirled quick as lightnin' an' bored them both... I\\nsneaked out an  ”\\n\\n“Why didn't you bore him?” roared Beasley.\\n\\nBuck Weaver steadily eyed his boss before he replied. “I ain't\\ntakin' shots at any fellar from behind doors. An' as fer meetin' Las\\nVegas  excoose me, boss! I've still a hankerin' fer sunshine an' red\\nliquor. Besides, I 'ain't got nothin' ag'in' Las Vegas. If he's rustled\\nover here at the head of a crowd to put us off I'd fight, jest as we'd\\nall fight. But you see we figgered wrong. It's between you an' Las\\nVegas!... You oughter seen him throw thet hunter Dale out of Turner's.”\\n\\n“Dale! Did he come?” queried Beasley.\\n\\n“He got there just after the cowboy plugged Jeff. An' thet big eyed\\ngirl, she came runnin' in, too. An' she keeled over in Dale's arms. Las\\nVegas shoved him out  cussed him so hard we all heerd... So, Beasley,\\nthere ain't no fight comin' off as we figgered on.”\\n\\nBeasley thus heard the West speak out of the mouth of his own man. And\\ngrim, sardonic, almost scornful, indeed, were the words of Buck Weaver.\\nThis rider had once worked for Al Auchincloss and had deserted to\\nBeasley under Mulvey's leadership. Mulvey was dead and the situation was\\nvastly changed.\\n\\nBeasley gave Weaver a dark, lowering glance, and waved him away. From\\nthe door Weaver sent back a doubtful, scrutinizing gaze, then slouched\\nout. That gaze Beasley had not encountered before.\\n\\nIt meant, as Weaver's cronies meant, as Beasley's long faithful riders,\\nand the people of the range, and as the spirit of the West meant, that\\nBeasley was expected to march down into the village to face his single\\nfoe.\\n\\nBut Beasley did not go. Instead he paced to and fro the length of Helen\\nRayner's long sitting room with the nervous energy of a man who\\ncould not rest. Many times he hesitated, and at others he made sudden\\nmovements toward the door, only to halt. Long after midnight he went\\nto bed, but not to sleep. He tossed and rolled all night, and at dawn\\narose, gloomy and irritable.\\n\\nHe cursed the Mexican serving women who showed their displeasure at\\nhis authority. And to his amaze and rage not one of his men came to\\nthe house. He waited and waited. Then he stalked off to the corrals and\\nstables carrying a rifle with him. The men were there, in a group that\\ndispersed somewhat at his advent. Not a Mexican was in sight.\\n\\nBeasley ordered the horses to be saddled and all hands to go down into\\nthe village with him. That order was disobeyed. Beasley stormed and\\nraged. His riders sat or lounged, with lowered faces. An unspoken\\nhostility seemed present. Those who had been longest with him were least\\ndistant and strange, but still they did not obey. At length Beasley\\nroared for his Mexicans.\\n\\n“Boss, we gotta tell you thet every greaser on the ranch hes\\nsloped  gone these two hours  on the way to Magdalena,” said Buck\\nWeaver.\\n\\nOf all these sudden uprising perplexities this latest was the most\\nastounding. Beasley cursed with his questioning wonder.\\n\\n“Boss, they was sure scared of thet gun slingin' cowboy from Texas,”\\n replied Weaver, imperturbably.\\n\\nBeasley's dark, swarthy face changed its hue. What of the subtle\\nreflection in Weaver's slow speech! One of the men came out of a corral\\nleading Beasley's saddled and bridled horse. This fellow dropped the\\nbridle and sat down among his comrades without a word. No one spoke. The\\npresence of the horse was significant. With a snarling, muttered curse,\\nBeasley took up his rifle and strode back to the ranch house.\\n\\nIn his rage and passion he did not realize what his men had known for\\nhours  that if he had stood any chance at all for their respect as well\\nas for his life the hour was long past.\\n\\nBeasley avoided the open paths to the house, and when he got there he\\nnervously poured out a drink. Evidently something in the fiery liquor\\nfrightened him, for he threw the bottle aside. It was as if that bottle\\ncontained a courage which was false.\\n\\nAgain he paced the long sitting room, growing more and more wrought up\\nas evidently he grew familiar with the singular state of affairs. Twice\\nthe pale serving woman called him to dinner.\\n\\nThe dining room was light and pleasant, and the meal, fragrant and\\nsteaming, was ready for him. But the women had disappeared. Beasley\\nseated himself  spread out his big hands on the table.\\n\\nThen a slight rustle  a clink of spur  startled him. He twisted his\\nhead.\\n\\n“Howdy, Beasley!” said Las Vegas, who had appeared as if by magic.\\n\\nBeasley's frame seemed to swell as if a flood had been loosed in his\\nveins. Sweat drops stood out on his pallid face.\\n\\n“What  you  want?” he asked, huskily.\\n\\n“Wal now, my boss, Miss Helen, says, seein' I am foreman heah, thet it'd\\nbe nice an' proper fer me to drop in an' eat with you  THE LAST TIME!”\\n replied the cowboy. His drawl was slow and cool, his tone was friendly\\nand pleasant. But his look was that of a falcon ready to drive deep its\\nbeak.\\n\\nBeasley's reply was loud, incoherent, hoarse.\\n\\nLas Vegas seated himself across from Beasley.\\n\\n“Eat or not, it's shore all the same to me,” said Las Vegas, and he\\nbegan to load his plate with his left hand. His right hand rested very\\nlightly, with just the tips of his vibrating fingers on the edge of\\nthe table; and he never for the slightest fraction of a second took his\\npiercing eyes off Beasley.\\n\\n“Wal, my half breed greaser guest, it shore roils up my blood to see you\\nsittin' there  thinkin' you've put my boss, Miss Helen, off this ranch,”\\n began Las Vegas, softly. And then he helped himself leisurely to food\\nand drink. “In my day I've shore stacked up against a lot of outlaws,\\nthieves, rustlers, an' sich like, but fer an out an' out dirty low down\\nskunk, you shore take the dough!... I'm goin, to kill you in a minit or\\nso, jest as soon as you move one of them dirty paws of yourn. But I hope\\nyou'll be polite an' let me say a few words. I'll never be happy again\\nif you don't... Of all the  yaller greaser dogs I ever seen, you're the\\nworst!... I was thinkin' last night mebbe you'd come down an' meet me\\nlike a man, so 's I could wash my hands ever afterward without gettin'\\nsick to my stummick. But you didn't come... Beasley, I'm so ashamed of\\nmyself thet I gotta call you  when I ought to bore you, thet  I ain't\\neven second cousin to my old self when I rode fer Chisholm. It don't\\nmean nuthin' to you to call you liar! robber! blackleg! a sneakin'\\ncoyote! an' a cheat thet hires others to do his dirty work!... By\\nGawd!  ”\\n\\n“Carmichael, gimme a word in,” hoarsely broke out Beasley. “You're\\nright, it won't do no good to call me... But let's talk... I'll buy\\nyou off. Ten thousand dollars  ”\\n\\n“Haw! Haw! Haw!” roared Las Vegas. He was as tense as a strung cord and\\nhis face possessed a singular pale radiance. His right hand began to\\nquiver more and more.\\n\\n“I'll  double  it!” panted Beasley. “I'll  make over  half the\\nranch  all the stock  ”\\n\\n“Swaller thet!” yelled Las Vegas, with terrible strident ferocity.\\n\\n“Listen  man!... I take  it back!... I'll give up  Auchincloss's ranch!”\\n Beasley was now a shaking, whispering, frenzied man, ghastly white, with\\nrolling eyes.\\n\\nLas Vegas's left fist pounded hard on the table.\\n\\n“GREASER, COME ON!” he thundered.\\n\\nThen Beasley, with desperate, frantic action, jerked for his gun.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\nFor Helen Rayner that brief, dark period of expulsion from her home had\\nbecome a thing of the past, almost forgotten.\\n\\nTwo months had flown by on the wings of love and work and the joy of\\nfinding her place there in the West. All her old men had been only too\\nglad of the opportunity to come back to her, and under Dale and Roy\\nBeeman a different and prosperous order marked the life of the ranch.\\n\\nHelen had made changes in the house by altering the arrangement of\\nrooms and adding a new section. Only once had she ventured into the old\\ndining room where Las Vegas Carmichael had sat down to that fatal dinner\\nfor Beasley. She made a store room of it, and a place she would never\\nagain enter.\\n\\nHelen was happy, almost too happy, she thought, and therefore made\\nmore than needful of the several bitter drops in her sweet cup of\\nlife. Carmichael had ridden out of Pine, ostensibly on the trail of the\\nMexicans who had executed Beasley's commands. The last seen of him\\nhad been reported from Show Down, where he had appeared red eyed and\\ndangerous, like a hound on a scent. Then two months had flown by without\\na word.\\n\\nDale had shaken his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboy's\\nabsence. It would be just like Las Vegas never to be heard of again.\\nAlso it would be more like him to remain away until all trace of his\\ndrunken, savage spell had departed from him and had been forgotten by\\nhis friends. Bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than\\nHelen. But Bo grew more restless, wilder, and more wilful than ever.\\nHelen thought she guessed Bo's secret; and once she ventured a hint\\nconcerning Carmichael's return.\\n\\n“If Tom doesn't come back pretty soon I'll marry Milt Dale,” retorted\\nBo, tauntingly.\\n\\nThis fired Helen's cheeks with red.\\n\\n“But, child,” she protested, half angry, half grave. “Milt and I are\\nengaged.”\\n\\n“Sure. Only you're so slow. There's many a slip  you know.”\\n\\n“Bo, I tell you Tom will come back,” replied Helen, earnestly. “I feel\\nit. There was something fine in that cowboy. He understood me better\\nthan you or Milt, either... And he was perfectly wild in love with\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Oh! WAS he?”\\n\\n“Very much more than you deserved, Bo Rayner.”\\n\\nThen occurred one of Bo's sweet, bewildering, unexpected\\ntransformations. Her defiance, resentment, rebelliousness, vanished from\\na softly agitated face.\\n\\n“Oh, Nell, I know that... You just watch me if I ever get another\\nchance at him!... Then  maybe he'd never drink again!”\\n\\n“Bo, be happy  and be good. Don't ride off any more  don't tease the\\nboys. It'll all come right in the end.”\\n\\nBo recovered her equanimity quickly enough.\\n\\n“Humph! You can afford to be cheerful. You've got a man who can't live\\nwhen you're out of his sight. He's like a fish on dry land... And\\nyou  why, once you were an old pessimist!”\\n\\nBo was not to be consoled or changed. Helen could only sigh and pray\\nthat her convictions would be verified.\\n\\n\\nThe first day of July brought an early thunder storm, just at sunrise.\\nIt roared and flared and rolled away, leaving a gorgeous golden cloud\\npageant in the sky and a fresh, sweetly smelling, glistening green range\\nthat delighted Helen's eye.\\n\\nBirds were twittering in the arbors and bees were humming in the\\nflowers. From the fields down along the brook came a blended song of\\nswamp blackbird and meadow lark. A clarion voiced burro split the air\\nwith his coarse and homely bray. The sheep were bleating, and a soft baa\\nof little lambs came sweetly to Helen's ears. She went her usual rounds\\nwith more than usual zest and thrill. Everywhere was color, activity,\\nlife. The wind swept warm and pine scented down from the mountain\\nheights, now black and bold, and the great green slopes seemed to call\\nto her.\\n\\nAt that very moment she came suddenly upon Dale, in his shirt sleeves,\\ndusty and hot, standing motionless, gazing at the distant mountains.\\nHelen's greeting startled him.\\n\\n“I  I was just looking away yonder,” he said, smiling. She thrilled at\\nthe clear, wonderful light of his eyes.\\n\\n“So was I  a moment ago,” she replied, wistfully. “Do you miss the\\nforest  very much?”\\n\\n“Nell, I miss nothing. But I'd like to ride with you under the pines\\nonce more.”\\n\\n“We'll go,” she cried.\\n\\n“When?” he asked, eagerly.\\n\\n“Oh  soon!” And then with flushed face and downcast eyes she passed on.\\nFor long Helen had cherished a fond hope that she might be married in\\nParadise Park, where she had fallen in love with Dale and had realized\\nherself. But she had kept that hope secret. Dale's eager tone, his\\nflashing eyes, had made her feel that her secret was there in her\\ntelltale face.\\n\\nAs she entered the lane leading to the house she encountered one of the\\nnew stable boys driving a pack mule.\\n\\n“Jim, whose pack is that?” she asked.\\n\\n“Ma'am, I dunno, but I heard him tell Roy he reckoned his name was mud,”\\n replied the boy, smiling.\\n\\nHelen's heart gave a quick throb. That sounded like Las Vegas. She\\nhurried on, and upon entering the courtyard she espied Roy Beeman\\nholding the halter of a beautiful, wild looking mustang. There was\\nanother horse with another man, who was in the act of dismounting on the\\nfar side. When he stepped into better view Helen recognized Las Vegas.\\nAnd he saw her at the same instant.\\n\\nHelen did not look up again until she was near the porch. She had\\ndreaded this meeting, yet she was so glad that she could have cried\\naloud.\\n\\n“Miss Helen, I shore am glad to see you,” he said, standing bareheaded\\nbefore her, the same young, frank faced cowboy she had seen first from\\nthe train.\\n\\n“Tom!” she exclaimed, and offered her hands.\\n\\nHe wrung them hard while he looked at her. The swift woman's glance\\nHelen gave in return seemed to drive something dark and doubtful out of\\nher heart. This was the same boy she had known  whom she had liked so\\nwell  who had won her sister's love. Helen imagined facing him thus was\\nlike awakening from a vague nightmare of doubt. Carmichael's face was\\nclean, fresh, young, with its healthy tan; it wore the old glad smile,\\ncool, easy, and natural; his eyes were like Dale's  penetrating, clear\\nas crystal, without a shadow. What had evil, drink, blood, to do\\nwith the real inherent nobility of this splendid specimen of Western\\nhardihood? Wherever he had been, whatever he had done during that\\nlong absence, he had returned long separated from that wild and savage\\ncharacter she could now forget. Perhaps there would never again be call\\nfor it.\\n\\n“How's my girl?” he asked, just as naturally as if he had been gone a\\nfew days on some errand of his employer's.\\n\\n“Bo? Oh, she's well  fine. I  I rather think she'll be glad to see you,”\\n replied Helen, warmly.\\n\\n“An' how's thet big Indian, Dale?” he drawled.\\n\\n“Well, too  I'm sure.”\\n\\n“Reckon I got back heah in time to see you all married?”\\n\\n“I  I assure you I  no one around here has been married yet,” replied\\nHelen, with a blush.\\n\\n“Thet shore is fine. Was some worried,” he said, lazily. “I've been\\nchasin' wild hosses over in New Mexico, an' I got after this heah blue\\nroan. He kept me chasin' him fer a spell. I've fetched him back for Bo.”\\n\\nHelen looked at the mustang Roy was holding, to be instantly delighted.\\nHe was a roan almost blue in color, neither large nor heavy, but\\npowerfully built, clean limbed, and racy, with a long mane and tail,\\nblack as coal, and a beautiful head that made Helen love him at once.\\n\\n“Well, I'm jealous,” declared Helen, archly. “I never did see such a\\npony.”\\n\\n“I reckoned you'd never ride any hoss but Ranger,” said Las Vegas.\\n\\n“No, I never will. But I can be jealous, anyhow, can't I?”\\n\\n“Shore. An I reckon if you say you're goin' to have him  wal, Bo 'd be\\nfunny,” he drawled.\\n\\n“I reckon she would be funny,” retorted Helen. She was so happy that\\nshe imitated his speech. She wanted to hug him. It was too good to be\\ntrue  the return of this cowboy. He understood her. He had come back\\nwith nothing that could alienate her. He had apparently forgotten the\\nterrible role he had accepted and the doom he had meted out to her\\nenemies. That moment was wonderful for Helen in its revelation of the\\nstrange significance of the West as embodied in this cowboy. He was\\ngreat. But he did not know that.\\n\\nThen the door of the living room opened, and a sweet, high voice pealed\\nout:\\n\\n“Roy! Oh, what a mustang! Whose is he?”\\n\\n“Wal, Bo, if all I hear is so he belongs to you,” replied Roy with a\\nhuge grin.\\n\\nBo appeared in the door. She stepped out upon the porch. She saw the\\ncowboy. The excited flash of her pretty face vanished as she paled.\\n\\n“Bo, I shore am glad to see you,” drawled Las Vegas, as he stepped\\nforward, sombrero in hand. Helen could not see any sign of confusion in\\nhim. But, indeed, she saw gladness. Then she expected to behold Bo run\\nright into the cowboys's arms. It appeared, however, that she was doomed\\nto disappointment.\\n\\n“Tom, I'm glad to see you,” she replied.\\n\\nThey shook hands as old friends.\\n\\n“You're lookin' right fine,” he said.\\n\\n“Oh, I'm well... And how have you been these six months?” she queried.\\n\\n“Reckon I though it was longer,” he drawled. “Wal, I'm pretty tip top\\nnow, but I was laid up with heart trouble for a spell.”\\n\\n“Heart trouble?” she echoed, dubiously.\\n\\n“Shore... I ate too much over heah in New Mexico.”\\n\\n“It's no news to me  where your heart's located,” laughed Bo. Then she\\nran off the porch to see the blue mustang. She walked round and round\\nhim, clasping her hands in sheer delight.\\n\\n“Bo, he's a plumb dandy,” said Roy. “Never seen a prettier hoss. He'll\\nrun like a streak. An' he's got good eyes. He'll be a pet some day. But\\nI reckon he'll always be spunky.”\\n\\n“Bo ventured to step closer, and at last got a hand on the mustang, and\\nthen another. She smoothed his quivering neck and called softly to him,\\nuntil he submitted to her hold.\\n\\n“What's his name?” she asked.\\n\\n“Blue somethin' or other,” replied Roy.\\n\\n“Tom, has my new mustang a name?” asked Bo, turning to the cowboy.\\n\\n“Shore.”\\n\\n“What then?”\\n\\n“Wal, I named him Blue Bo,” answered Las Vegas, with a smile.\\n\\n“Blue Boy?”\\n\\n“Nope. He's named after you. An' I chased him, roped him, broke him all\\nmyself.”\\n\\n“Very well. Blue Bo he is, then... And he's a wonderful darling horse.\\nOh, Nell, just look at him... Tom, I can't thank you enough.”\\n\\n“Reckon I don't want any thanks,” drawled the cowboy. “But see heah, Bo,\\nyou shore got to live up to conditions before you ride him.”\\n\\n“What!” exclaimed Bo, who was startled by his slow, cool, meaning tone,\\nof voice.\\n\\nHelen delighted in looking at Las Vegas then. He had never appeared to\\nbetter advantage. So cool, careless, and assured! He seemed master of\\na situation in which his terms must be accepted. Yet he might have been\\nactuated by a cowboy motive beyond the power of Helen to divine.\\n\\n“Bo Rayner,” drawled Las Vegas, “thet blue mustang will be yours, an'\\nyou can ride him  when you're MRS. TOM CARMICHAEL!”\\n\\nNever had he spoken a softer, more drawling speech, nor gazed at Bo\\nmore mildly. Roy seemed thunderstruck. Helen endeavored heroically to\\nrestrain her delicious, bursting glee. Bo's wide eyes stared at her\\nlover  darkened  dilated. Suddenly she left the mustang to confront the\\ncowboy where he lounged on the porch steps.\\n\\n“Do you mean that?” she cried.\\n\\n“Shore do.”\\n\\n“Bah! It's only a magnificent bluff,” she retorted. “You're only in fun.\\nIt's your  your darned nerve!”\\n\\n“Why, Bo,” began Las Vegas, reproachfully. “You shore know I'm not the\\nfour flusher kind. Never got away with a bluff in my life! An' I'm jest\\nin daid earnest aboot this heah.”\\n\\nAll the same, signs were not wanting in his mobile face that he was\\nalmost unable to restrain his mirth.\\n\\nHelen realized then that Bo saw through the cowboy  that the ultimatum\\nwas only one of his tricks.\\n\\n“It IS a bluff and I CALL you!” declared Bo, ringingly.\\n\\nLas Vegas suddenly awoke to consequences. He essayed to speak, but she\\nwas so wonderful then, so white and blazing eyed, that he was stricken\\nmute.\\n\\n“I'll ride Blue Bo this afternoon,” deliberately stated the girl.\\n\\nLas Vegas had wit enough to grasp her meaning, and he seemed about to\\ncollapse.\\n\\n“Very well, you can make me Mrs. Tom Carmichael to day  this\\nmorning  just before dinner... Go get a preacher to marry us  and\\nmake yourself look a more presentable bridegroom  UNLESS IT WAS ONLY A\\nBLUFF!”\\n\\nHer imperiousness changed as the tremendous portent of her words seemed\\nto make Las Vegas a blank, stone image of a man. With a wild rose color\\nsuffusing her face, she swiftly bent over him, kissed him, and flashed\\naway into the house. Her laugh pealed back, and it thrilled Helen, so\\ndeep and strange was it for the wilful sister, so wild and merry and\\nfull of joy.\\n\\nIt was then that Roy Beeman recovered from his paralysis, to let out\\nsuch a roar of mirth as to frighten the horses. Helen was laughing, and\\ncrying, too, but laughing mostly. Las Vegas Carmichael was a sight for\\nthe gods to behold. Bo's kiss had unclamped what had bound him. The\\nsudden truth, undeniable, insupportable, glorious, made him a madman.\\n\\n“Bluff  she called me  ride Blue Bo saf'ternoon!” he raved,\\nreaching wildly for Helen. “Mrs.  Tom  Carmichael  before\\ndinner  preacher  presentable bridegroom!... Aw! I'm drunk again! I  who\\nswore off forever!”\\n\\n“No, Tom, you're just happy,” said Helen.\\n\\nBetween her and Roy the cowboy was at length persuaded to accept the\\nsituation and to see his wonderful opportunity.\\n\\n“Now  now, Miss Helen  what'd Bo mean by pre  presentable bridegroom?...\\nPresents? Lord, I'm clean busted flat!”\\n\\n“She meant you must dress up in your best, of course,” replied Helen.\\n\\n“Where 'n earth will I get a preacher?... Show Down's forty miles...\\nCan't ride there in time... Roy, I've gotta have a preacher... Life or\\ndeath deal fer me.”\\n\\n“Wal, old man, if you'll brace up I'll marry you to Bo,” said Roy, with\\nhis glad grin.\\n\\n“Aw!” gasped Las Vegas, as if at the coming of a sudden beautiful hope.\\n\\n“Tom, I'm a preacher,” replied Roy, now earnestly. “You didn't know\\nthet, but I am. An' I can marry you an' Bo as good as any one, an'\\ntighter 'n most.”\\n\\nLas Vegas reached for his friend as a drowning man might have reached\\nfor solid rock.\\n\\n“Roy, can you really marry them  with my Bible  and the service of my\\nchurch?” asked Helen, a happy hope flushing her face.\\n\\n“Wal, indeed I can. I've married more 'n one couple whose religion\\nwasn't mine.”\\n\\n“B b before  d d din ner!” burst out Las Vegas, like a stuttering idiot.\\n\\n“I reckon. Come on, now, an' make yourself pre senttible,” said Roy.\\n“Miss Helen, you tell Bo thet it's all settled.”\\n\\nHe picked up the halter on the blue mustang and turned away toward the\\ncorrals. Las Vegas put the bridle of his horse over his arm, and seemed\\nto be following in a trance, with his dazed, rapt face held high.\\n\\n“Bring Dale,” called Helen, softly after them.\\n\\n\\nSo it came about as naturally as it was wonderful that Bo rode the blue\\nmustang before the afternoon ended.\\n\\nLas Vegas disobeyed his first orders from Mrs. Tom Carmichael and rode\\nout after her toward the green rising range. Helen seemed impelled to\\nfollow. She did not need to ask Dale the second time. They rode swiftly,\\nbut never caught up with Bo and Las Vegas, whose riding resembled their\\nhappiness.\\n\\nDale read Helen's mind, or else his own thoughts were in harmony with\\nhers, for he always seemed to speak what she was thinking. And as they\\nrode homeward he asked her in his quiet way if they could not spare a\\nfew days to visit his old camp.\\n\\n“And take Bo  and Tom? Oh, of all things I'd like to'” she replied.\\n\\n“Yes  an' Roy, too,” added Dale, significantly.\\n\\n“Of course,” said Helen, lightly, as if she had not caught his meaning.\\nBut she turned her eyes away, while her heart thumped disgracefully and\\nall her body was aglow. “Will Tom and Bo go?”\\n\\n“It was Tom who got me to ask you,” replied Dale. “John an' Hal can look\\nafter the men while we're gone.”\\n\\n“Oh  so Tom put it in your head? I guess  maybe  I won't go.”\\n\\n“It is always in my mind, Nell,” he said, with his slow seriousness.\\n“I'm goin' to work all my life for you. But I'll want to an' need to go\\nback to the woods often... An' if you ever stoop to marry me  an' make\\nme the richest of men  you'll have to marry me up there where I fell in\\nlove with you.”\\n\\n“Ah! Did Las Vegas Tom Carmichael say that, too?” inquired Helen,\\nsoftly.\\n\\n“Nell, do you want to know what Las Vegas said?”\\n\\n“By all means.”\\n\\n“He said this  an' not an hour ago. 'Milt, old hoss, let me give you a\\nhunch. I'm a man of family now  an' I've been a devil with the wimmen\\nin my day. I can see through 'em. Don't marry Nell Rayner in or near the\\nhouse where I killed Beasley. She'd remember. An' don't let her remember\\nthet day. Go off into the woods. Paradise Park! Bo an' me will go with\\nyou.”\\n\\nHelen gave him her hand, while they walked the horses homeward in the\\nlong sunset shadows. In the fullness of that happy hour she had time for\\na grateful wonder at the keen penetration of the cowboy Carmichael. Dale\\nhad saved her life, but it was Las Vegas who had saved her happiness.\\n\\n\\nNot many days later, when again the afternoon shadows were slanting low,\\nHelen rode out upon the promontory where the dim trail zigzagged far\\nabove Paradise Park.\\n\\nRoy was singing as he drove the pack burros down the slope; Bo and Las\\nVegas were trying to ride the trail two abreast, so they could hold\\nhands; Dale had dismounted to stand beside Helen's horse, as she gazed\\ndown the shaggy black slopes to the beautiful wild park with its gray\\nmeadows and shining ribbons of brooks.\\n\\nIt was July, and there were no golden red glorious flames and blazes of\\ncolor such as lingered in Helen's memory. Black spruce slopes and green\\npines and white streaks of aspens and lacy waterfall of foam and dark\\noutcroppings of rock  these colors and forms greeted her gaze with all\\nthe old enchantment. Wildness, beauty, and loneliness were there, the\\nsame as ever, immutable, like the spirit of those heights.\\n\\nHelen would fain have lingered longer, but the others called, and Ranger\\nimpatiently snorted his sense of the grass and water far below. And she\\nknew that when she climbed there again to the wide outlook she would be\\nanother woman.\\n\\n“Nell, come on,” said Dale, as he led on. “It's better to look up.”\\n\\n\\nThe sun had just sunk behind the ragged fringe of mountain rim when\\nthose three strong and efficient men of the open had pitched camp and\\nhad prepared a bountiful supper. Then Roy Beeman took out the little\\nworn Bible which Helen had given him to use when he married Bo, and as\\nhe opened it a light changed his dark face.\\n\\n“Come, Helen an' Dale,” he said.\\n\\nThey arose to stand before him. And he married them there under the\\ngreat, stately pines, with the fragrant blue smoke curling upward, and\\nthe wind singing through the branches, while the waterfall murmured its\\nlow, soft, dreamy music, and from the dark slope came the wild, lonely\\ncry of a wolf, full of the hunger for life and a mate.\\n\\n“Let us pray,” said Roy, as he closed the Bible, and knelt with them.\\n\\n“There is only one God, an' Him I beseech in my humble office for the\\nwoman an' man I have just wedded in holy bonds. Bless them an' watch\\nthem an' keep them through all the comin' years. Bless the sons of\\nthis strong man of the woods an' make them like him, with love an'\\nunderstandin' of the source from which life comes. Bless the daughters\\nof this woman an' send with them more of her love an' soul, which must\\nbe the softenin' an' the salvation of the hard West. O Lord, blaze the\\ndim, dark trail for them through the unknown forest of life! O Lord,\\nlead the way across the naked range of the future no mortal knows! We\\nask in Thy name! Amen.”\\n\\nWhen the preacher stood up again and raised the couple from their\\nkneeling posture, it seemed that a grave and solemn personage had left\\nhim. This young man was again the dark faced, clear eyed Roy, droll and\\ndry, with the enigmatic smile on his lips.\\n\\n“Mrs. Dale,” he said, taking her hands, “I wish you joy... An' now,\\nafter this here, my crownin' service in your behalf  I reckon I'll claim\\na reward.”\\n\\nThen he kissed her. Bo came next with her warm and loving felicitations,\\nand the cowboy, with characteristic action, also made at Helen.\\n\\n“Nell, shore it's the only chance I'll ever have to kiss you,” he\\ndrawled. “Because when this heah big Indian once finds out what kissin'\\nis  !”\\n\\nLas Vegas then proved how swift and hearty he could be upon occasions.\\nAll this left Helen red and confused and unutterably happy. She\\nappreciated Dale's state. His eyes reflected the precious treasure\\nwhich manifestly he saw, but realization of ownership had not yet become\\ndemonstrable.\\n\\nThen with gay speech and happy laugh and silent look these five partook\\nof the supper. When it was finished Roy made known his intention to\\nleave. They all protested and coaxed, but to no avail. He only laughed\\nand went on saddling his horse.\\n\\n“Roy, please stay,” implored Helen. “The day's almost ended. You're\\ntired.”\\n\\n“Nope. I'll never be no third party when there's only two.”\\n\\n“But there are four of us.”\\n\\n“Didn't I just make you an' Dale one?... An', Mrs. Dale, you forget I've\\nbeen married more 'n once.”\\n\\nHelen found herself confronted by an unanswerable side of the argument.\\nLas Vegas rolled on the grass in his mirth. Dale looked strange.\\n\\n“Roy, then that's why you're so nice,” said Bo, with a little devil in\\nher eyes. “Do you know I had my mind made up if Tom hadn't come around I\\nwas going to make up to you, Roy... I sure was. What number wife would\\nI have been?”\\n\\nIt always took Bo to turn the tables on anybody. Roy looked mightily\\nembarrassed. And the laugh was on him. He did not face them again until\\nhe had mounted.\\n\\n“Las Vegas, I've done my best for you  hitched you to thet blue eyed\\ngirl the best I know how,” he declared. “But I shore ain't guaranteein'\\nnothin'. You'd better build a corral for her.”\\n\\n“Why, Roy, you shore don't savvy the way to break these wild ones,”\\n drawled Las Vegas. “Bo will be eatin' out of my hand in about a week.”\\n\\nBo's blue eyes expressed an eloquent doubt as to this extraordinary\\nclaim.\\n\\n“Good by, friends,” said Roy, and rode away to disappear in the spruces.\\n\\nThereupon Bo and Las Vegas forgot Roy, and Dale and Helen, the camp\\nchores to be done, and everything else except themselves. Helen's first\\nwifely duty was to insist that she should and could and would help her\\nhusband with the work of cleaning up after the sumptuous supper. Before\\nthey had finished a sound startled them. It came from Roy, evidently\\nhigh on the darkening slope, and was a long, mellow pealing halloo, that\\nrang on the cool air, burst the dreamy silence, and rapped across\\nfrom slope to slope and cliff to cliff, to lose its power and die away\\nhauntingly in the distant recesses.\\n\\nDale shook his head as if he did not care to attempt a reply to that\\nbeautiful call. Silence once again enfolded the park, and twilight\\nseemed to be born of the air, drifting downward.\\n\\n“Nell, do you miss anythin'?” asked Dale.\\n\\n“No. Nothing in all the world,” she murmured. “I am happier than I ever\\ndared pray to be.”\\n\\n“I don't mean people or things. I mean my pets.”\\n\\n“Ah! I had forgotten... Milt, where are they?”\\n\\n“Gone back to the wild,” he said. “They had to live in my absence. An'\\nI've been away long.”\\n\\nJust then the brooding silence, with its soft murmur of falling water\\nand faint sigh of wind in the pines, was broken by a piercing scream,\\nhigh, quivering, like that of a woman in exquisite agony.\\n\\n“That's Tom!” exclaimed Dale.\\n\\n“Oh  I was so  so frightened!” whispered Helen.\\n\\nBo came running, with Las Vegas at her heels.\\n\\n“Milt, that was your tame cougar,” cried Bo, excitedly. “Oh, I'll never\\nforget him! I'll hear those cries in my dreams!”\\n\\n“Yes, it was Tom,” said Dale, thoughtfully. “But I never heard him cry\\njust like that.”\\n\\n“Oh, call him in!”\\n\\nDale whistled and called, but Tom did not come. Then the hunter stalked\\noff in the gloom to call from different points under the slope. After\\na while he returned without the cougar. And at that moment, from far\\nup the dark ravine, drifted down the same wild cry, only changed by\\ndistance, strange and tragic in its meaning.\\n\\n“He scented us. He remembers. But he'll never come back,” said Dale.\\n\\n\\nHelen felt stirred anew with the convictions of Dale's deep knowledge of\\nlife and nature. And her imagination seemed to have wings. How full and\\nperfect her trust, her happiness in the realization that her love and\\nher future, her children, and perhaps grandchildren, would come under\\nthe guidance of such a man! Only a little had she begun to comprehend\\nthe secrets of good and ill in their relation to the laws of nature.\\nAges before men had lived on the earth there had been the creatures of\\nthe wilderness, and the holes of the rocks, and the nests of the trees,\\nand rain, frost, heat, dew, sunlight and night, storm and calm, the\\nhoney of the wildflower and the instinct of the bee  all the beautiful\\nand multiple forms of life with their inscrutable design. To know\\nsomething of them and to love them was to be close to the kingdom of\\nearth  perhaps to the greater kingdom of heaven. For whatever breathed\\nand moved was a part of that creation. The coo of the dove, the lichen\\non the mossy rock, the mourn of a hunting wolf, and the murmur of the\\nwaterfall, the ever green and growing tips of the spruces, and the\\nthunderbolts along the battlements of the heights  these one and all\\nmust be actuated by the great spirit  that incalculable thing in the\\nuniverse which had produced man and soul.\\n\\nAnd there in the starlight, under the wide gnarled pines, sighing low\\nwith the wind, Helen sat with Dale on the old stone that an avalanche\\nof a million years past had flung from the rampart above to serve as\\ncamp table and bench for lovers in the wilderness; the sweet scent of\\nspruce mingled with the fragrance of wood smoke blown in their faces.\\nHow white the stars, and calm and true! How they blazed their single\\ntask! A coyote yelped off on the south slope, dark now as midnight. A\\nbit of weathered rock rolled and tapped from shelf to shelf. And the\\nwind moaned. Helen felt all the sadness and mystery and nobility of this\\nlonely fastness, and full on her heart rested the supreme consciousness\\nthat all would some day be well with the troubled world beyond.\\n\\n“Nell, I'll homestead this park,” said Dale. “Then it'll always be\\nours.”\\n\\n“Homestead! What's that?” murmured Helen, dreamily. The word sounded\\nsweet.\\n\\n“The government will give land to men who locate an' build,” replied\\nDale. “We'll run up a log cabin.”\\n\\n“And come here often... Paradise Park!” whispered Helen.\\n\\nDale's first kisses were on her lips then, hard and cool and clean, like\\nthe life of the man, singularly exalting to her, completing her woman's\\nstrange and unutterable joy of the hour, and rendering her mute.\\n\\nBo's melodious laugh, and her voice with its old mockery of torment,\\ndrifted softly on the night breeze. And the cowboy's “Aw, Bo,” drawling\\nhis reproach and longing, was all that the tranquil, waiting silence\\nneeded.\\n\\nParadise Park was living again one of its romances. Love was no stranger\\nto that lonely fastness. Helen heard in the whisper of the wind through\\nthe pine the old earth story, beautiful, ever new, and yet eternal.\\nShe thrilled to her depths. The spar pointed spruces stood up black\\nand clear against the noble stars. All that vast solitude breathed and\\nwaited, charged full with its secret, ready to reveal itself to her\\ntremulous soul.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Man of the Forest, by Zane Grey\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN OF THE FOREST ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 3457 0.txt or 3457 0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/4/5/3457/\\n\\nProduced by Richard Fane\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one  the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.

       " 'At sunset hour the forest was still, lonely, sweet with tang of fir and\\nspruce, blazing in gold and red and green; and the man who glided on\\nunder the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and, disappearing,\\nto have become a part of the wild woodland.',\n",
       " 'Old Baldy, highest of the White Mountains, stood up round and bare,\\nrimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun. Then, as the\\nfire dropped behind the domed peak, a change, a cold and darkening\\nblight, passed down the black spear pointed slopes over all that\\nmountain world.',\n",
       " 'It was a wild, richly timbered, and abundantly watered region of dark\\nforests and grassy parks, ten thousand feet above sea level, isolated\\non all sides by the southern Arizona desert  the virgin home of elk and\\ndeer, of bear and lion, of wolf and fox, and the birthplace as well as\\nthe hiding place of the fierce Apache.',\n",
       " 'September in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze\\nfollowing shortly after sundown. Twilight appeared to come on its wings,\\nas did faint sounds, not distinguishable before in the stillness.',\n",
       " 'Milt Dale, man of the forest, halted at the edge of a timbered ridge, to\\nlisten and to watch. Beneath him lay a narrow valley, open and grassy,\\nfrom which rose a faint murmur of running water. Its music was pierced\\nby the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote. From overhead in the\\ngiant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the\\nnight; and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild\\nturkeys going to roost.',\n",
       " \"To Dale's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been,\\nbetokening an unchanged serenity of forestland. He was glad, for he had\\nexpected to hear the clipclop of white men's horses  which to hear up\\nin those fastnesses was hateful to him. He and the Indian were friends.\\nThat fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter. But there hid\\nsomewhere in the forest a gang of bad men, sheep thieves, whom Dale did\\nnot want to meet.\",\n",
       " \"As he started out upon the slope, a sudden flaring of the afterglow of\\nsunset flooded down from Old Baldy, filling the valley with lights and\\nshadows, yellow and blue, like the radiance of the sky. The pools in the\\ncurves of the brook shone darkly bright. Dale's gaze swept up and down\\nthe valley, and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook\\nwhere the wall of spruce stood up, its speared and spiked crest against\\nthe pale clouds. The wind began to moan in the trees and there was a\\nfeeling of rain in the air. Dale, striking a trail, turned his back to\\nthe fading afterglow and strode down the valley.\",\n",
       " 'With night at hand and a rain storm brewing, he did not head for his\\nown camp, some miles distant, but directed his steps toward an old log\\ncabin. When he reached it darkness had almost set in. He approached with\\ncaution. This cabin, like the few others scattered in the valleys, might\\nharbor Indians or a bear or a panther. Nothing, however, appeared to be\\nthere. Then Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky, and he felt\\nthe cool dampness of a fine, misty rain on his face. It would rain off\\nand on during the night. Whereupon he entered the cabin.',\n",
       " 'And the next moment he heard quick hoof beats of trotting horses.\\nPeering out, he saw dim, moving forms in the darkness, quite close\\nat hand. They had approached against the wind so that sound had been\\ndeadened. Five horses with riders, Dale made out  saw them loom close.\\nThen he heard rough voices. Quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a\\nladder he knew led to a loft; and finding it, he quickly mounted, taking\\ncare not to make a noise with his rifle, and lay down upon the floor\\nof brush and poles. Scarcely had he done so when heavy steps, with\\naccompaniment of clinking spurs, passed through the door below into the\\ncabin.',\n",
       " '“Wal, Beasley, are you here?” queried a loud voice.',\n",
       " 'There was no reply. The man below growled under his breath, and again\\nthe spurs jingled.',\n",
       " \"“Fellars, Beasley ain't here yet,” he called. “Put the hosses under the\\nshed. We'll wait.”\",\n",
       " \"“Wait, huh!” came a harsh reply. “Mebbe all night  an' we got nuthin' to\\neat.”\",\n",
       " \"“Shut up, Moze. Reckon you're no good for anythin' but eatin'. Put them\\nhosses away an' some of you rustle fire wood in here.”\",\n",
       " 'Low, muttered curses, then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain\\nof leather and heaves of tired horses.',\n",
       " 'Another shuffling, clinking footstep entered the cabin.',\n",
       " \"“Snake, it'd been sense to fetch a pack along,” drawled this newcomer.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon so, Jim. But we didn't, an' what's the use hollerin'? Beasley\\nwon't keep us waitin' long.”\",\n",
       " \"Dale, lying still and prone, felt a slow start in all his blood  a\\nthrilling wave. That deep voiced man below was Snake Anson, the worst\\nand most dangerous character of the region; and the others, undoubtedly,\\ncomposed his gang, long notorious in that sparsely settled country.\\nAnd the Beasley mentioned  he was one of the two biggest ranchers and\\nsheep raisers of the White Mountain ranges. What was the meaning of\\na rendezvous between Snake Anson and Beasley? Milt Dale answered that\\nquestion to Beasley's discredit; and many strange matters pertaining to\\nsheep and herders, always a mystery to the little village of Pine, now\\nbecame as clear as daylight.\",\n",
       " 'Other men entered the cabin.',\n",
       " \"“It ain't a goin' to rain much,” said one. Then came a crash of wood\\nthrown to the ground.\",\n",
       " \"“Jim, hyar's a chunk of pine log, dry as punk,” said another.\",\n",
       " 'Rustlings and slow footsteps, and then heavy thuds attested to the\\nprobability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to\\nsplit off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured.',\n",
       " \"“Snake, lemme your pipe, an' I'll hev a fire in a jiffy.”\",\n",
       " \"“Wal, I want my terbacco an' I ain't carin' about no fire,” replied\\nSnake.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon you're the meanest cuss in these woods,” drawled Jim.\",\n",
       " \"Sharp click of steel on flint  many times  and then a sound of hard\\nblowing and sputtering told of Jim's efforts to start a fire. Presently\\nthe pitchy blackness of the cabin changed; there came a little crackling\\nof wood and the rustle of flame, and then a steady growing roar.\",\n",
       " 'As it chanced, Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft, and right\\nnear his eyes there were cracks between the boughs. When the fire blazed\\nup he was fairly well able to see the men below. The only one he had\\never seen was Jim Wilson, who had been well known at Pine before Snake\\nAnson had ever been heard of. Jim was the best of a bad lot, and he had\\nfriends among the honest people. It was rumored that he and Snake did\\nnot pull well together.',\n",
       " \"“Fire feels good,” said the burly Moze, who appeared as broad as he was\\nblack visaged. “Fall's sure a comin'... Now if only we had some grub!”\",\n",
       " \"“Moze, there's a hunk of deer meat in my saddle bag, an' if you git it\\nyou can have half,” spoke up another voice.\",\n",
       " 'Moze shuffled out with alacrity.',\n",
       " \"In the firelight Snake Anson's face looked lean and serpent like, his\\neyes glittered, and his long neck and all of his long length carried out\\nthe analogy of his name.\",\n",
       " \"“Snake, what's this here deal with Beasley?” inquired Jim.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon you'll l'arn when I do,” replied the leader. He appeared tired\\nand thoughtful.\",\n",
       " \"“Ain't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herders  for\\nnothin'?” queried the youngest of the gang, a boy in years, whose hard,\\nbitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades.\",\n",
       " \"“You're dead right, Burt  an' that's my stand,” replied the man who\\nhad sent Moze out. “Snake, snow 'll be flyin' round these woods before\\nlong,” said Jim Wilson. “Are we goin' to winter down in the Tonto Basin\\nor over on the Gila?”\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon we'll do some tall ridin' before we strike south,” replied\\nSnake, gruffly.\",\n",
       " 'At the juncture Moze returned.',\n",
       " \"“Boss, I heerd a hoss comin' up the trail,” he said.\",\n",
       " 'Snake rose and stood at the door, listening. Outside the wind moaned\\nfitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin.',\n",
       " '“A huh!” exclaimed Snake, in relief.',\n",
       " 'Silence ensued then for a moment, at the end of which interval Dale\\nheard a rapid clip clop on the rocky trail outside. The men below\\nshuffled uneasily, but none of them spoke. The fire cracked cheerily.\\nSnake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that\\nexpressed both doubt and caution.',\n",
       " 'The trotting horse had halted out there somewhere.',\n",
       " '“Ho there, inside!” called a voice from the darkness.',\n",
       " '“Ho yourself!” replied Anson.',\n",
       " '“That you, Snake?” quickly followed the query.',\n",
       " '“Reckon so,” returned Anson, showing himself.',\n",
       " 'The newcomer entered. He was a large man, wearing a slicker that shone\\nwet in the firelight. His sombrero, pulled well down, shadowed his face,\\nso that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked.\\nHe had a black, drooping mustache, and a chin like a rock.

       " 'CHAPTER II',\n",
       " 'Milt Dale quietly sat up to gaze, with thoughtful eyes, into the gloom.',\n",
       " 'He was thirty years old. As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his\\nschool and home in Iowa and, joining a wagon train of pioneers, he was\\none of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the White\\nMountains. But he had not taken kindly to farming or sheep raising or\\nmonotonous home toil, and for twelve years he had lived in the forest,\\nwith only infrequent visits to Pine and Show Down and Snowdrop. This\\nwandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for\\nthe villagers, for he did care, and he was welcome everywhere, but\\nthat he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive\\ninstinctive force of a savage.',\n",
       " 'And on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one\\nof all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a\\nfriend.',\n",
       " \"“That man Beasley!” he soliloquized. “Beasley  in cahoots with Snake\\nAnson!... Well, he was right. Al Auchincloss is on his last legs. Poor\\nold man! When I tell him he'll never believe ME, that's sure!”\",\n",
       " 'Discovery of the plot meant to Dale that he must hurry down to Pine.',\n",
       " '“A girl  Helen Rayner  twenty years old,” he mused. “Beasley wants her\\nmade off with... That means  worse than killed!”',\n",
       " \"Dale accepted facts of life with that equanimity and fatality acquired\\nby one long versed in the cruel annals of forest lore. Bad men worked\\ntheir evil just as savage wolves relayed a deer. He had shot wolves for\\nthat trick. With men, good or bad, he had not clashed. Old women and\\nchildren appealed to him, but he had never had any interest in girls.\\nThe image, then, of this Helen Rayner came strangely to Dale; and he\\nsuddenly realized that he had meant somehow to circumvent Beasley, not\\nto befriend old Al Auchincloss, but for the sake of the girl. Probably\\nshe was already on her way West, alone, eager, hopeful of a future home.\\nHow little people guessed what awaited them at a journey's end! Many\\ntrails ended abruptly in the forest  and only trained woodsmen could\\nread the tragedy.\",\n",
       " '“Strange how I cut across country to day from Spruce Swamp,” reflected\\nDale. Circumstances, movements, usually were not strange to him. His\\nmethods and habits were seldom changed by chance. The matter, then, of\\nhis turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason, and\\nof his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl, was\\nindeed an adventure to provoke thought. It provoked more, for Dale grew\\nconscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins. He who had\\nlittle to do with the strife of men, and nothing to do with anger, felt\\nhis blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl.',\n",
       " \"“Old Al won't listen to me,” pondered Dale. “An' even if he did, he\\nwouldn't believe me. Maybe nobody will... All the same, Snake Anson\\nwon't get that girl.”\",\n",
       " 'With these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position, and\\nhis pondering ceased. Taking his rifle, he descended from the loft and\\npeered out of the door. The night had grown darker, windier, cooler;\\nbroken clouds were scudding across the sky; only a few stars showed;\\nfine rain was blowing from the northwest; and the forest seemed full of\\na low, dull roar.',\n",
       " \"“Reckon I'd better hang up here,” he said, and turned to the fire. The\\ncoals were red now. From the depths of his hunting coat he procured a\\nlittle bag of salt and some strips of dried meat. These strips he laid\\nfor a moment on the hot embers, until they began to sizzle and curl;\\nthen with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter\\ngrateful for little.\",\n",
       " 'He sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of\\nthe fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing, glowing, golden embers.\\nOutside, the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased\\nto a roar. Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him, drowsily\\nlulling; and he heard the storm wind in the trees, now like a waterfall,\\nand anon like a retreating army, and again low and sad; and he saw\\npictures in the glowing embers, strange as dreams.',\n",
       " 'Presently he rose and, climbing to the loft, he stretched himself out,\\nand soon fell asleep.',\n",
       " \"\\nWhen the gray dawn broke he was on his way, 'cross country, to the\\nvillage of Pine.\",\n",
       " 'During the night the wind had shifted and the rain had ceased. A\\nsuspicion of frost shone on the grass in open places. All was gray  the\\nparks, the glades  and deeper, darker gray marked the aisles of the\\nforest. Shadows lurked under the trees and the silence seemed consistent\\nwith spectral forms. Then the east kindled, the gray lightened, the\\ndreaming woodland awoke to the far reaching rays of a bursting red sun.',\n",
       " \"This was always the happiest moment of Dale's lonely days, as sunset\\nwas his saddest. He responded, and there was something in his blood that\\nanswered the whistle of a stag from a near by ridge. His strides were\\nlong, noiseless, and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the\\ndew laden grass.\",\n",
       " 'Dale pursued a zigzag course over the ridges to escape the hardest\\nclimbing, but the “senacas”  those parklike meadows so named by Mexican\\nsheep herders  were as round and level as if they had been made by man\\nin beautiful contrast to the dark green, rough, and rugged ridges. Both\\nopen senaca and dense wooded ridge showed to his quick eye an abundance\\nof game. The cracking of twigs and disappearing flash of gray among the\\nspruces, a round black lumbering object, a twittering in the brush,\\nand stealthy steps, were all easy signs for Dale to read. Once, as he\\nnoiselessly emerged into a little glade, he espied a red fox stalking\\nsome quarry, which, as he advanced, proved to be a flock of partridges.\\nThey whirred up, brushing the branches, and the fox trotted away. In\\nevery senaca Dale encountered wild turkeys feeding on the seeds of the\\nhigh grass.',\n",
       " 'It had always been his custom, on his visits to Pine, to kill and\\npack fresh meat down to several old friends, who were glad to give him\\nlodging. And, hurried though he was now, he did not intend to make an\\nexception of this trip.',\n",
       " 'At length he got down into the pine belt, where the great, gnarled,\\nyellow trees soared aloft, stately, and aloof from one another, and the\\nground was a brown, odorous, springy mat of pine needles, level as a\\nfloor. Squirrels watched him from all around, scurrying away at his\\nnear approach  tiny, brown, light striped squirrels, and larger ones,\\nrusset colored, and the splendid dark grays with their white bushy tails\\nand plumed ears.',\n",
       " 'This belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide, gray, rolling, open land,\\nalmost like a prairie, with foot hills lifting near and far, and the\\nred gold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun. Here Dale\\nflushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their\\nsubdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build,\\nshowed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock. They began\\nto run pell mell out into the grass, until only their heads appeared\\nbobbing along, and finally disappeared. Dale caught a glimpse of\\nskulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys, and as\\nthey saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the\\nhindmost. His bullet struck low, as he had meant it to, but too low, and\\nthe coyote got only a dusting of earth and pine needles thrown up into\\nhis face. This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt\\ninto a tree, rolled over, gained his feet, and then the cover of the\\nforest. Dale was amused at this. His hand was against all the predatory\\nbeasts of the forest, though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf\\nand fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the\\ngentle, beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed. But some he\\nloved better than others, and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty.',\n",
       " 'He crossed the wide, grassy plain and struck another gradual descent\\nwhere aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm, sun lighted\\nglades bordered along a sparkling brook. Here he heard a turkey gobble,\\nand that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching,\\nsilent detour around a clump of aspens. In a sunny patch of grass\\na dozen or more big gobblers stood, all suspiciously facing in his\\ndirection, heads erect, with that wild aspect peculiar to their species.\\nOld wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk. Dale\\nshot two of them. The others began to run like ostriches, thudding over\\nthe ground, spreading their wings, and with that running start launched\\ntheir heavy bodies into whirring flight. They flew low, at about the\\nheight of a man from the grass, and vanished in the woods.',\n",
       " 'Dale threw the two turkeys over his shoulder and went on his way. Soon\\nhe came to a break in the forest level, from which he gazed down a\\nleague long slope of pine and cedar, out upon the bare, glistening\\ndesert, stretching away, endlessly rolling out to the dim, dark horizon\\nline.',\n",
       " 'The little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered\\nforest. A road, running parallel with a dark watered, swift flowing\\nstream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue\\nsmoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow\\nin the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted\\nwith horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site\\nappeared to be a natural clearing, for there was no evidence of cut\\ntimber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene,\\ntranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and\\nhappy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.',\n",
       " 'Dale halted before a neat little log cabin and a little patch of garden\\nbordered with sunflowers. His call was answered by an old woman, gray\\nand bent, but remarkably spry, who appeared at the door.',\n",
       " \"“Why, land's sakes, if it ain't Milt Dale!” she exclaimed, in welcome.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon it's me, Mrs. Cass,” he replied. “An' I've brought you a\\nturkey.”\",\n",
       " \"“Milt, you're that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass... What\\na gobbler! First one I've seen this fall. My man Tom used to fetch home\\ngobblers like that... An' mebbe he'll come home again sometime.”\",\n",
       " 'Her husband, Tom Cass, had gone into the forest years before and had\\nnever returned. But the old woman always looked for him and never gave\\nup hope.',\n",
       " \"“Men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back,” replied Dale, as\\nhe had said to her many a time.\",\n",
       " '“Come right in. You air hungry, I know. Now, son, when last did you eat\\na fresh egg or a flapjack?”',\n",
       " '“You should remember,” he answered, laughing, as he followed her into a\\nsmall, clean kitchen.',\n",
       " \"“Laws a' me! An' thet's months ago,” she replied, shaking her gray head.\\n“Milt, you should give up that wild life  an' marry  an' have a home.”\",\n",
       " '“You always tell me that.”',\n",
       " \"“Yes, an' I'll see you do it yet... Now you set there, an' pretty soon\\nI'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water.”\",\n",
       " \"“What's the news, Auntie?” he asked.\",\n",
       " \"“Nary news in this dead place. Why, nobody's been to Snowdrop in two\\nweeks!... Sary Jones died, poor old soul  she's better off  an' one of\\nmy cows run away. Milt, she's wild when she gits loose in the woods.\\nAn' you'll have to track her, 'cause nobody else can. An' John Dakker's\\nheifer was killed by a lion, an' Lem Harden's fast hoss  you know his\\nfavorite  was stole by hoss thieves. Lem is jest crazy. An' that reminds\\nme, Milt, where's your big ranger, thet you'd never sell or lend?”\",\n",
       " '“My horses are up in the woods, Auntie; safe, I reckon, from\\nhorse thieves.”',\n",
       " \"“Well, that's a blessin'. We've had some stock stole this summer, Milt,\\nan' no mistake.”\",\n",
       " \"Thus, while preparing a meal for Dale, the old woman went on recounting\\nall that had happened in the little village since his last visit. Dale\\nenjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy, and it was exceedingly good\\nto sit at her table. In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been\\nsuch butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple\\npie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of\\nDale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest.\",\n",
       " \"“How's old Al Auchincloss?” presently inquired Dale.\",\n",
       " \"“Poorly  poorly,” sighed Mrs. Cass. “But he tramps an' rides around\\nsame as ever. Al's not long for this world... An', Milt, that reminds\\nme  there's the biggest news you ever heard.”\",\n",
       " \"“You don't say so!” exclaimed Dale, to encourage the excited old woman.\",\n",
       " \"“Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece, Helen Rayner. She's to\\ninherit all his property. We've heard much of her  a purty lass, they\\nsay... Now, Milt Dale, here's your chance. Stay out of the woods an' go\\nto work... You can marry that girl!”\",\n",
       " '“No chance for me, Auntie,” replied Dale, smiling.',\n",
       " \"The old woman snorted. “Much you know! Any girl would have you, Milt\\nDale, if you'd only throw a kerchief.”\",\n",
       " \"“Me!... An' why, Auntie?” he queried, half amused, half thoughtful. When\\nhe got back to civilization he always had to adjust his thoughts to the\\nideas of people.\",\n",
       " \"“Why? I declare, Milt, you live so in the woods you're like a boy of\\nten  an' then sometimes as old as the hills... There's no young man to\\ncompare with you, hereabouts. An' this girl  she'll have all the spunk\\nof the Auchinclosses.”\",\n",

       " 'Dale bade good by again to his old friend and strode away, thoughtful\\nand serious. Beasley would not only be difficult to circumvent, but he\\nwould be dangerous to oppose. There did not appear much doubt of his\\ndriving his way rough shod to the dominance of affairs there in Pine.\\nDale, passing down the road, began to meet acquaintances who had\\nhearty welcome for his presence and interest in his doings, so that his\\npondering was interrupted for the time being. He carried the turkey to\\nanother old friend, and when he left her house he went on to the village\\nstore. This was a large log cabin, roughly covered with clapboards, with\\na wide plank platform in front and a hitching rail in the road. Several\\nhorses were standing there, and a group of lazy, shirt sleeved loungers.',\n",

       " \"After a long period of absence Dale always experienced a singular warmth\\nof feeling when he met these acquaintances. It faded quickly when he got\\nback to the intimacy of his woodland, and that was because the people of\\nPine, with few exceptions  though they liked him and greatly admired his\\noutdoor wisdom  regarded him as a sort of nonentity. Because he loved\\nthe wild and preferred it to village and range life, they had classed\\nhim as not one of them. Some believed him lazy; others believed him\\nshiftless; others thought him an Indian in mind and habits; and there\\nwere many who called him slow witted. Then there was another side to\\ntheir regard for him, which always afforded him good natured amusement.\\nTwo of this group asked him to bring in some turkey or venison; another\\nwanted to hunt with him. Lem Harden came out of the store and appealed\\nto Dale to recover his stolen horse. Lem's brother wanted a wild running\\nmare tracked and brought home. Jesse Lyons wanted a colt broken, and\\nbroken with patience, not violence, as was the method of the hard riding\\nboys at Pine. So one and all they besieged Dale with their selfish\\nneeds, all unconscious of the flattering nature of these overtures. And\\non the moment there happened by two women whose remarks, as they entered\\nthe store, bore strong testimony to Dale's personality.\",\n",

       " \"The flat, square stone and log cabin of unusually large size stood upon\\na little hill half a mile out of the village. A home as well as a fort,\\nit had been the first structure erected in that region, and the process\\nof building had more than once been interrupted by Indian attacks.\\nThe Apaches had for some time, however, confined their fierce raids to\\npoints south of the White Mountain range. Auchincloss's house looked\\ndown upon barns and sheds and corrals of all sizes and shapes, and\\nhundreds of acres of well cultivated soil. Fields of oats waved gray and\\nyellow in the afternoon sun; an immense green pasture was divided by a\\nwillow bordered brook, and here were droves of horses, and out on the\\nrolling bare flats were straggling herds of cattle.\",\n",
       " \"The whole ranch showed many years of toil and the perseverance of\\nman. The brook irrigated the verdant valley between the ranch and the\\nvillage. Water for the house, however, came down from the high, wooded\\nslope of the mountain, and had been brought there by a simple expedient.\\nPine logs of uniform size had been laid end to end, with a deep trough\\ncut in them, and they made a shining line down the slope, across the\\nvalley, and up the little hill to the Auchincloss home. Near the house\\nthe hollowed halves of logs had been bound together, making a crude\\npipe. Water ran uphill in this case, one of the facts that made the\\nranch famous, as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small\\nboys of Pine. The two good women who managed Auchincloss's large\\nhousehold were often shocked by the strange things that floated into\\ntheir kitchen with the ever flowing stream of clear, cold mountain\\nwater.\",\n",
       " 'As it happened this day Dale encountered Al Auchincloss sitting in the\\nshade of a porch, talking to some of his sheep herders and stockmen.\\nAuchincloss was a short man of extremely powerful build and great width\\nof shoulder. He had no gray hairs, and he did not look old, yet there\\nwas in his face a certain weariness, something that resembled sloping\\nlines of distress, dim and pale, that told of age and the ebb tide of\\nvitality. His features, cast in large mold, were clean cut and comely,\\nand he had frank blue eyes, somewhat sad, yet still full of spirit.',\n",
       " 'Dale had no idea how his visit would be taken, and he certainly would\\nnot have been surprised to be ordered off the place. He had not set foot\\nthere for years.

       " 'Helen Rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twenty four\\nhours before she made an alarming discovery.',\n",
       " \"Accompanied by her sister Bo, a precocious girl of sixteen, Helen had\\nleft St. Joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at\\nhome, yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life\\nin the Far West. All her people had the pioneer spirit; love of change,\\naction, adventure, was in her blood. Then duty to a widowed mother\\nwith a large and growing family had called to Helen to accept this rich\\nuncle's offer. She had taught school and also her little brothers and\\nsisters; she had helped along in other ways. And now, though the\\ntearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard, this opportunity was\\nirresistible in its call. The prayer of her dreams had been answered. To\\nbring good fortune to her family; to take care of this beautiful, wild\\nlittle sister; to leave the yellow, sordid, humdrum towns for the great,\\nrolling, boundless open; to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day\\nto be her own; to have fulfilled a deep, instinctive, and undeveloped\\nlove of horses, cattle, sheep, of desert and mountain, of trees and\\nbrooks and wild flowers  all this was the sum of her most passionate\\nlongings, now in some marvelous, fairylike way to come true.\",\n",
       " 'A check to her happy anticipations, a blank, sickening dash of cold\\nwater upon her warm and intimate dreams, had been the discovery\\nthat Harve Riggs was on the train. His presence could mean only one\\nthing  that he had followed her. Riggs had been the worst of many\\nsore trials back there in St. Joseph. He had possessed some claim or\\ninfluence upon her mother, who favored his offer of marriage to Helen;\\nhe was neither attractive, nor good, nor industrious, nor anything that\\ninterested her; he was the boastful, strutting adventurer, not genuinely\\nWestern, and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety. Helen had\\nsuspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his,\\nand also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be bad  as\\nWestern men were bad. But on the train, in the station at La Junta, one\\nglimpse of him, manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of\\nher sight, warned Helen that she now might have a problem on her hands.',\n",
       " \"The recognition sobered her. All was not to be a road of roses to this\\nnew home in the West. Riggs would follow her, if he could not accompany\\nher, and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything. Helen felt the\\nstartling realization of being cast upon her own resources, and then\\na numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness. But these\\nfeelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her\\ntemper. Opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to\\nit. She would not have been Al Auchincloss's niece if she had faltered.\\nAnd, when temper was succeeded by genuine anger, she could have laughed\\nto scorn this Harve Riggs and his schemes, whatever they were. Once\\nand for all she dismissed fear of him. When she left St. Joseph she had\\nfaced the West with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of\\nthat West. Homes had to be made out there in that far country, so Uncle\\nAl had written, and women were needed to make homes. She meant to be one\\nof these women and to make of her sister another. And with the thought\\nthat she would know definitely what to say to Riggs when he approached\\nher, sooner or later, Helen dismissed him from mind.\",\n",
       " \"While the train was in motion, enabling Helen to watch the ever changing\\nscenery, and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping Bo well in\\nhand at stations, she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests\\nand the red, rocky gullies and the dim, bold mountains. She saw the sun\\nset over distant ranges of New Mexico  a golden blaze of glory, as new\\nto her as the strange fancies born in her, thrilling and fleeting by.\\nBo's raptures were not silent, and the instant the sun sank and the\\ncolor faded she just as rapturously importuned Helen to get out the huge\\nbasket of food they had brought from home.\",\n",
       " 'They had two seats, facing each other, at the end of the coach, and\\npiled there, with the basket on top, was luggage that constituted all\\nthe girls owned in the world. Indeed, it was very much more than they\\nhad ever owned before, because their mother, in her care for them and\\ndesire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle, had spent\\nmoney and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes.',\n",
       " 'The girls sat together, with the heavy basket on their knees, and ate\\nwhile they gazed out at the cool, dark ridges. The train clattered\\nslowly on, apparently over a road that was all curves. And it was\\nsupper time for everybody in that crowded coach. If Helen had not been\\nso absorbed by the great, wild mountain land she would have had more\\ninterest in the passengers. As it was she saw them, and was amused\\nand thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car, all\\nmiddle class people, poor and hopeful, traveling out there to the New\\nWest to find homes. It was splendid and beautiful, this fact, yet it\\ninspired a brief and inexplicable sadness. From the train window, that\\nworld of forest and crag, with its long bare reaches between, seemed so\\nlonely, so wild, so unlivable. How endless the distance! For hours and\\nmiles upon miles no house, no hut, no Indian tepee! It was amazing, the\\nlength and breadth of this beautiful land.

Evidently\\nhe caught Bo's admiring gaze, for, with a word to his companions, he\\nsauntered toward the window where the girls sat. His gait was singular,\\nalmost awkward, as if he was not accustomed to walking. The long spurs\\njingled musically. He removed his sombrero and stood at ease, frank,\\ncool, smiling.

Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican children that\\ndarted into adobe huts as the train clattered by, and she exclaimed her\\npleasure in the Indians, and the mustangs, and particularly in a group\\nof cowboys riding into town on spirited horses. Helen saw all Bo pointed\\nout, but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung\\nlongest, and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something\\nfrom her. She had never before experienced any feeling like that; she\\nhad never seen a tenth so far. And the sight awoke something strange\\nin her. The sun was burning hot, as she could tell when she put a hand\\noutside the window, and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the\\ntrain. She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest\\nwere the sun and the dust and the wind. And her realization made her\\nlove them. It was there; the open, the wild, the beautiful, the lonely\\nland; and she felt the poignant call of blood in her  to seek, to\\nstrive, to find, to live. One look down that yellow valley, endless\\nbetween its dark iron ramparts, had given her understanding of her\\nuncle. She must be like him in spirit, as it was claimed she resembled\\nhim otherwise.',\n",
       " 'At length Bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life, and,\\nwith her bright head on the faded cloak, she went to sleep. But Helen\\nkept steady, farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain; and\\nduring the long hours, as she watched through clouds of dust and veils\\nof heat, some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to\\nchange and then to fix. It was her physical acceptance  her eyes and her\\nsenses taking the West as she had already taken it in spirit.',\n",
       " 'A woman should love her home wherever fate placed her, Helen believed,\\nand not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living. How\\ncould life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous\\nvastness of bare earth and open sky, where the need to achieve made\\nthinking and pondering superficial?',\n",
       " 'It was with regret that she saw the last of the valley of the Rio\\nGrande, and then of its paralleled mountain ranges. But the miles\\nbrought compensation in other valleys, other bold, black upheavals of\\nrock, and then again bare, boundless yellow plains, and sparsely cedared\\nridges, and white dry washes, ghastly in the sunlight, and dazzling\\nbeds of alkali, and then a desert space where golden and blue flowers\\nbloomed.',\n",
       " 'She noted, too, that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had\\nbegun to shade to red  and this she knew meant an approach to\\nArizona. Arizona, the wild, the lonely, the red desert, the green\\nplateau  Arizona with its thundering rivers, its unknown spaces, its\\npasture lands and timber lands, its wild horses, cowboys, outlaws,\\nwolves and lions and savages! As to a boy, that name stirred and\\nthrilled and sang to her of nameless, sweet, intangible things,\\nmysterious and all of adventure. But she, being a girl of twenty, who\\nhad accepted responsibilities, must conceal the depths of her heart and\\nthat which her mother had complained was her misfortune in not being\\nborn a boy.',\n",
       " \"Time passed, while Helen watched and learned and dreamed. The train\\nstopped, at long intervals, at wayside stations where there seemed\\nnothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans, and dust and heat.

And she was full of\\nconjectures as to who would meet them, what would happen. So Helen was\\ndrawn back to sober realities, in which there was considerable zest.\\nAssuredly she did not know what was going to happen. Twice Riggs passed\\nup and down the aisle, his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile\\ndeliberately forced upon her sight. But again Helen fought a growing\\ndread with contemptuous scorn. This fellow was not half a man. It was\\nnot conceivable what he could do, except annoy her, until she arrived\\nat Pine. Her uncle was to meet her or send for her at Snowdrop, which\\nplace, Helen knew, was distant a good long ride by stage from Magdalena.\\nThis stage ride was the climax and the dread of all the long journey, in\\nHelen's considerations.\",\n",

It was a hard moment and, though she shivered inwardly, she\\nwelcomed the initial and inevitable step. This man Dale, by his dress of\\nbuckskin, must be either scout or hunter. His size, his action, the tone\\nof his voice had been reassuring. But Helen must decide from what she\\nsaw in his face whether or not to trust him.

       " 'Dale laid off his sombrero and leaned forward, holding his rifle between\\nhis knees. The light shone better upon his features now that he was\\nbareheaded.

And now that\\nthe die was cast she could not tell why she had trusted it. There was\\nsingular force in it, but she did not recognize what kind of force. One\\ninstant she thought it was stern, and the next that it was sweet, and\\nagain that it was neither.',\n",

       " \"“For reasons you ought to guess,” replied Dale, and he leaned forward\\nagain. Neither his voice nor face changed in the least, but yet there\\nwas a something about him that fascinated Helen. “I'm a hunter. I live\\nin the woods. A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm\\nan' I took to an old log cabin. Soon as I got there I heard horses.\\nI hid up in the loft. Some men rode up an' come in. It was dark. They\\ncouldn't see me. An' they talked. It turned out they were Snake Anson\\nan' his gang of sheep thieves. They expected to meet Beasley there.\\nPretty soon he came. He told Anson how old Al, your uncle, was on his\\nlast legs  how he had sent for you to have his property when he died.\\nBeasley swore he had claims on Al. An' he made a deal with Anson to get\\nyou out of the way. He named the day you were to reach Magdalena. With\\nAl dead an' you not there, Beasley could get the property. An' then he\\nwouldn't care if you did come to claim it. It 'd be too late... Well,\\nthey rode away that night. An' next day I rustled down to Pine. They're\\nall my friends at Pine, except old Al. But they think I'm queer. I\\ndidn't want to confide in many people. Beasley is strong in Pine, an'\\nfor that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides\\nBeasley. So I went to see your uncle. He never had any use for me\\nbecause he thought I was lazy like an Indian. Old Al hates lazy men.\\nThen we fell out  or he fell out  because he believed a tame lion of\\nmine had killed some of his sheep. An' now I reckon that Tom might have\\ndone it. I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasley's about you, but\\nold Al wouldn't listen. He's cross  very cross. An' when I tried to tell\\nhim, why, he went right out of his head. Sent me off the ranch. Now I\\nreckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in. Finally I went to four\\nfriends I could trust. They're Mormon boys  brothers. That's Joe out\\non top, with the driver. I told them all about Beasley's deal an' asked\\nthem to help me. So we planned to beat Anson an' his gang to Magdalena.\\nIt happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine.\\nAn' we had to go careful. But the boys had a couple of friends\\nhere  Mormons, too, who agreed to help us. They had this old stage...\\nAn' here you are.” Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at\\nHelen and then at Bo.\",\n",
       " \"“You're perfectly splendid!” cried Bo, ringingly. She was white; her\\nfingers were clenched; her eyes blazed.\",\n",
       " \"Dale appeared startled out of his gravity, and surprised, then pleased.\\nA smile made his face like a boy's. Helen felt her body all rigid, yet\\nslightly trembling. Her hands were cold. The horror of this revelation\\nheld her speechless. But in her heart she echoed Bo's exclamation of\\nadmiration and gratitude.\",\n",
       " \"“So far, then,” resumed Dale, with a heavy breath of relief. “No wonder\\nyou're upset. I've a blunt way of talkin'... Now we've thirty miles to\\nride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off. To day sometime the\\nrest of the boys  Roy, John, an' Hal  were to leave Show Down, which's\\na town farther on from Snowdrop. They have my horses an' packs besides\\ntheir own. Somewhere on the road we'll meet them  to night, maybe  or\\ntomorrow. I hope not to night, because that 'd mean Anson's gang was\\nridin' in to Magdalena.”\",\n",
       " 'Helen wrung her hands helplessly.',\n",
       " '“Oh, have I no courage?” she whispered.',\n",
       " \"“Nell, I'm as scared as you are,” said Bo, consolingly, embracing her\\nsister.\",\n",
       " \"“I reckon that's natural,” said Dale, as if excusing them. “But, scared\\nor not, you both brace up. It's a bad job. But I've done my best. An'\\nyou'll be safer with me an' the Beeman boys than you'd be in Magdalena,\\nor anywhere else, except your uncle's.”\",\n",
       " \"“Mr.  Mr. Dale,” faltered Helen, with her tears falling, “don't think me\\na coward  or  or ungrateful. I'm neither. It's only I'm so  so shocked.\\nAfter all we hoped and expected  this  this  is such a  a terrible\\nsurprise.”\",\n",

       " \"“Good! We may have some hard ridin' before I get you up to Pine. Hello!\\nWhat's that?”\",\n",
       " 'Above the creaking, rattling, rolling roar of the stage Helen heard a\\nrapid beat of hoofs. A horse flashed by, galloping hard.',\n",
       " 'Dale opened the door and peered out. The stage rolled to a halt. He\\nstepped down and gazed ahead.',\n",
       " '“Joe, who was that?” he queried.',\n",
       " \"“Nary me. An' Bill didn't know him, either,” replied Joe. “I seen him\\n'way back. He was ridin' some. An' he slowed up goin' past us. Now he's\\nrunnin' again.”\",\n",

       " 'His words, meant to be kind and reassuring, were almost as sinister to\\nHelen as the menace to her own life. Long had she known how cheap life\\nwas held in the West, but she had only known it abstractly, and she had\\nnever let the fact remain before her consciousness. This cheerful young\\nman spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf. The thought it roused\\nwas tragic  for bloodshed was insupportable to her  and then the thrills\\nwhich followed were so new, strange, bold, and tingling that they were\\nrevolting. Helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths, of instincts at\\nwhich she was amazed and ashamed.',\n",
       " \"“Joe, hand down that basket of grub  the small one with the canteen,”\\n said Dale, reaching out a long arm. Presently he placed a cloth covered\\nbasket inside the stage. “Girls, eat all you want an' then some.”\",\n",

       " \"With that he took his rifle and, closing the door, clambered up to the\\ndriver's seat. Then the stage lurched again and began to roll along.\",\n",

       " 'Whereupon she found herself actually hungry, and while she ate she\\nglanced out of the stage, first from one side and then from the other.\\nThese windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in.\\nThe sun had long since sunk. Out to the west, where a bold, black\\nhorizon line swept away endlessly, the sky was clear gold, shading\\nto yellow and blue above. Stars were out, pale and wan, but growing\\nbrighter.

       " '“I heard some animal yelp,” said Bo, suddenly, and she listened with\\nhead poised.',\n",

There were dim shapes in the gloom ahead, and always they\\ngave Helen uneasiness, until closer approach proved them to be rocks\\nor low, scrubby trees. These increased in both size and number as the\\nhorses progressed. Often Helen looked back into the gloom behind.\\nThis act was involuntary and occasioned her sensations of dread. Dale\\nexpected to be pursued. And Helen experienced, along with the dread,\\nflashes of unfamiliar resentment. Not only was there an attempt afoot\\nto rob her of her heritage, but even her personal liberty. Then she\\nshuddered at the significance of Dale's words regarding her possible\\nabduction by this hired gang. It seemed monstrous, impossible.

The pines were big,\\nbrown barked, seamed, and knotted, with no typical conformation except\\na majesty and beauty. They grew far apart. Few small pines and little\\nunderbrush flourished beneath them. The floor of this forest appeared\\nremarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and\\nwide brown areas of pine needles. These manifestly were what Roy\\nhad meant by pine mats. Here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or\\nrotting. Helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and\\nthe strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all, and when\\nthey did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log. Likewise\\nshe became aware of a springy nature of the ground. And then she saw\\nthat the pine mats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the\\nhorses, and after they had passed sprang back to place again, leaving no\\ntrack. Helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind. Indeed,\\nit would take a sharp eye to follow Dale through that forest. This\\nknowledge was infinitely comforting to Helen, and for the first time\\nsince the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind\\nand heart. It left her free for some of the appreciation she might have\\nhad in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances.',\n",

But here under the stately pines there were\\nno birds. Squirrels, however, began to be seen here and there, and in\\nthe course of an hour's travel became abundant. The only one with which\\nshe was familiar was the chipmunk. All the others, from the slim bright\\nblacks to the striped russets and the white tailed grays, were totally\\nnew to her. They appeared tame and curious. The reds barked and scolded\\nat the passing cavalcade; the blacks glided to some safe branch, there\\nto watch; the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their\\ndomain.\",\n",
       " 'Once Dale, halting his horse, pointed with long arm, and Helen,\\nfollowing the direction, descried several gray deer standing in a glade,\\nmotionless, with long ears up. They made a wild and beautiful picture.\\nSuddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides.',\n",
       " 'The forest on the whole held to the level, open character, but there\\nwere swales and stream beds breaking up its regular conformity. Toward\\nnoon, however, it gradually changed, a fact that Helen believed she\\nmight have observed sooner had she been more keen. The general lay of\\nthe land began to ascend, and the trees to grow denser.',\n",
       " 'She made another discovery. Ever since she had entered the forest she\\nhad become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting\\nher nostrils. She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But\\npresently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine\\nodor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch.\\nThe smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength.\\nAlso her throat and lungs seemed to burn.',\n",
       " 'When she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings\\nit was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied\\nrecognition. Thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they\\ngrew worse. One, especially, was a pain beyond all her experience.\\nIt lay in the muscles of her side, above her hip, and it grew to be a\\ntreacherous thing, for it was not persistent. It came and went. After it\\ndid come, with a terrible flash, it could be borne by shifting or easing\\nthe body. But it gave no warning. When she expected it she was mistaken;\\nwhen she dared to breathe again, then, with piercing swiftness,\\nit returned like a blade in her side. This, then, was one of the\\nriding pains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride. It\\nwas almost too much to be borne. The beauty of the forest, the living\\ncreatures to be seen scurrying away, the time, distance  everything\\nfaded before that stablike pain. To her infinite relief she found that\\nit was the trot that caused this torture. When Ranger walked she did not\\nhave to suffer it. Therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared\\nor until Dale and Bo were almost out of sight; then she loped him ahead\\nuntil he had caught up.',\n",
       " 'So the hours passed, the sun got around low, sending golden shafts\\nunder the trees, and the forest gradually changed to a brighter, but a\\nthicker, color. This slowly darkened. Sunset was not far away.',\n",
       " 'She heard the horses splashing in water, and soon she rode up to see the\\ntiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss.\\nShe crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a\\nmore open place in the forest where the pines were huge, towering,\\nand far apart. A low, gray bluff of stone rose to the right, perhaps\\none third as high as the trees. From somewhere came the rushing sound of\\nrunning water.',\n",
       " '“Big Spring,” announced Dale. “We camp here. You girls have done well.”',\n",
       " 'Another glance proved to Helen that all those little streams poured from\\nunder this gray bluff.',\n",
       " \"“I'm dying for a drink,” cried Bo with her customary hyperbole.\",\n",
       " \"“I reckon you'll never forget your first drink here,” remarked Dale.\",\n",
       " 'Bo essayed to dismount, and finally fell off, and when she did get to\\nthe ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function, and she\\nfell flat. Dale helped her up.',\n",
       " \"“What's wrong with me, anyhow?” she demanded, in great amaze.\",\n",
       " '“Just stiff, I reckon,” replied Dale, as he led her a few awkward steps.',\n",
       " '“Bo, have you any hurts?” queried Helen, who still sat her horse, loath\\nto try dismounting, yet wanting to beyond all words.',\n",
       " 'Bo gave her an eloquent glance.',\n",
       " \"“Nell, did you have one in your side, like a wicked, long\\ndarning needle, punching deep when you weren't ready?”\",\n",
       " \"“That one I'll never get over!” exclaimed Helen, softly. Then, profiting\\nby Bo's experience, she dismounted cautiously, and managed to keep\\nupright. Her legs felt like wooden things.\",\n",
       " 'Presently the girls went toward the spring.',\n",
       " '“Drink slow,” called out Dale.',\n",
       " 'Big Spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray, weathered\\nbluff, from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water.\\nIts fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold\\nstone.',\n",
       " \"Helen and Bo lay flat on a mossy bank, seeing their faces as they bent\\nover, and they sipped a mouthful, by Dale's advice, and because they\\nwere so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a\\nprecious opportunity.\",\n",
       " 'The water was so cold that it sent a shock over Helen, made her teeth\\nache, and a singular, revivifying current steal all through her,\\nwonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh, irresistible\\nin its appeal to thirst. Helen raised her head to look at this water. It\\nwas colorless as she had found it tasteless.',\n",
       " '“Nell  drink!” panted Bo. “Think of our  old spring  in the\\norchard  full of pollywogs!”',\n",

       " 'The first camp duty Dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the\\nhorses, and, opening it, he took out tarpaulin and blankets, which he\\narranged on the ground under a pine tree.',\n",
       " '“You girls rest,” he said, briefly.',\n",
       " \"“Can't we help?” asked Helen, though she could scarcely stand.\",\n",
       " \"“You'll be welcome to do all you like after you're broke in.”\",\n",
       " \"“Broke in!” ejaculated Bo, with a little laugh. “I'm all broke UP now.”\",\n",

       " \"“It does,” replied Bo, as slowly she sat down upon the blankets,\\nstretched out with a long sigh, and laid her head on a saddle. “Nell,\\ndidn't he say not to call him Mister?”\",\n",
       " 'Dale was throwing the packs off the other horses.',\n",
       " 'Helen lay down beside Bo, and then for once in her life she experienced\\nthe sweetness of rest.',\n",
       " '“Well, sister, what do you intend to call him?” queried Helen,\\ncuriously.',\n",
       " '“Milt, of course,” replied Bo.',\n",
       " 'Helen had to laugh despite her weariness and aches.',\n",
       " '“I suppose, then, when your Las Vegas cowboy comes along you will call\\nhim what he called you.”',\n",
       " 'Bo blushed, which was a rather unusual thing for her.',\n",
       " \"“I will if I like,” she retorted. “Nell, ever since I could remember\\nyou've raved about the West. Now you're OUT West, right in it good and\\ndeep. So wake up!”\",\n",
       " \"That was Bo's blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination\\nof Helen's superficialities. It sank deep. Helen had no retort. Her\\nambition, as far as the West was concerned, had most assuredly not been\\nfor such a wild, unheard of jaunt as this. But possibly the West  a\\nliving from day to day  was one succession of adventures, trials,\\ntests, troubles, and achievements. To make a place for others to live\\ncomfortably some day! That might be Bo's meaning, embodied in her\\nforceful hint. But Helen was too tired to think it out then. She found\\nit interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch Dale.\",\n",
       " 'He hobbled the horses and turned them loose. Then with ax in hand he\\napproached a short, dead tree, standing among a few white barked\\naspens. Dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax. With his coat off,\\ndisplaying his wide shoulders, straight back, and long, powerful arms,\\nhe looked a young giant. He was lithe and supple, brawny but not bulky.\\nThe ax rang on the hard wood, reverberating through the forest. A few\\nstrokes sufficed to bring down the stub. Then he split it up. Helen was\\ncurious to see how he kindled a fire. First he ripped splinters out of\\nthe heart of the log, and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground.\\nThen from a saddlebag which hung on a near by branch he took flint and\\nsteel and a piece of what Helen supposed was rag or buckskin, upon\\nwhich powder had been rubbed. At any rate, the first strike of the steel\\nbrought sparks, a blaze, and burning splinters. Instantly the flame\\nleaped a foot high. He put on larger pieces of wood crosswise, and the\\nfire roared.',\n",
       " 'That done, he stood erect, and, facing the north, he listened. Helen\\nremembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before\\nsince the arrival at Big Spring. It was Roy for whom he was listening\\nand watching. The sun had set and across the open space the tips of the\\npines were losing their brightness.',\n",
       " 'The camp utensils, which the hunter emptied out of a sack, gave forth a\\njangle of iron and tin. Next he unrolled a large pack, the contents\\nof which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes. These evidently\\ncontained food supplies. The bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over\\nit, pack and all. Dale filled it at the spring. Upon returning to the\\ncamp fire he poured water into a washbasin, and, getting down to his\\nknees, proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly. The act seemed a habit,\\nfor Helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods\\nand listened. Then he dried his hands over the fire, and, turning to the\\nspread out pack, he began preparations for the meal.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly Helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied.\\nAt Magdalena, on the stage ride, and last night, she had trusted\\nthis stranger, a hunter of the White Mountains, who appeared ready to\\nbefriend her. And she had felt an exceeding gratitude. Still, she had\\nlooked at him impersonally. But it began to dawn upon her that chance\\nhad thrown her in the company of a remarkable man. That impression\\nbaffled her. It did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind\\nto help a young woman in peril, or that he appeared deft and quick at\\ncamp fire chores. Most Western men were brave, her uncle had told her,\\nand many were roughly kind, and all of them could cook. This hunter was\\nphysically a wonderful specimen of manhood, with something leonine about\\nhis stature. But that did not give rise to her impression. Helen\\nhad been a school teacher and used to boys, and she sensed a boyish\\nsimplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter. She believed, however,\\nthat it was a mental and spiritual force in Dale which had drawn her to\\nthink of it.',\n",
       " \"“Nell, I've spoken to you three times,” protested Bo, petulantly. “What\\n're you mooning over?”\",\n",
       " \"“I'm pretty tired  and far away, Bo,” replied Helen. “What did you say?”\",\n",
       " '“I said I had an e normous appetite.”',\n",
       " \"“Really. That's not remarkable for you. I'm too tired to eat. And afraid\\nto shut my eyes. They'd never come open. When did we sleep last, Bo?”\",\n",
       " '“Second night before we left home,” declared Bo.',\n",
       " \"“Four nights! Oh, we've slept some.”\",\n",
       " \"“I'll bet I make mine up in this woods. Do you suppose we'll sleep right\\nhere  under this tree  with no covering?”\",\n",
       " '“It looks so,” replied Helen, dubiously.',\n",
       " \"“How perfectly lovely!” exclaimed Bo, in delight. “We'll see the stars\\nthrough the pines.”\",\n",
       " \"“Seems to be clouding over. Wouldn't it be awful if we had a storm?”\",\n",
       " \"“Why, I don't know,” answered Bo, thoughtfully. “It must storm out\\nWest.”\",\n",
       " 'Again Helen felt a quality of inevitableness in Bo. It was something\\nthat had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St. Joseph.\\nAll of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thought  a thrilling\\nconsciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop in a new and wild\\nenvironment. How strange, and fearful, perhaps, to watch that growth!\\nBo, being younger, more impressionable, with elemental rather than\\nintellectual instincts, would grow stronger more swiftly. Helen wondered\\nif she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive. But how could\\nanyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way? It was the\\nsavage who did not think.',\n",
       " 'Helen saw Dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest.',\n",
       " \"“Reckon Roy ain't comin',” he soliloquized. “An' that's good.” Then he\\nturned to the girls. “Supper's ready.”\",\n",
       " 'The girls responded with a spirit greater than their activity. And\\nthey ate like famished children that had been lost in the woods. Dale\\nattended them with a pleasant light upon his still face.',\n",

       " '“What kind?” asked Bo.',\n",
       " \"“Wild turkey or deer. Maybe both, if you like. But it's well to take\\nwild meat slow. An' turkey  that 'll melt in your mouth.”\",\n",
       " \"“Uummm!” murmured Bo, greedily. “I've heard of wild turkey.”\",\n",
       " \"When they had finished Dale ate his meal, listening to the talk of the\\ngirls, and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bo's. It was\\ntwilight when he began to wash the pots and pans, and almost dark by the\\ntime his duties appeared ended. Then he replenished the campfire and\\nsat down on a log to gaze into the fire. The girls leaned comfortably\\npropped against the saddles.\",\n",
       " \"“Nell, I'll keel over in a minute,” said Bo. “And I oughtn't  right on\\nsuch a big supper.”\",\n",
       " \"“I don't see how I can sleep, and I know I can't stay awake,” rejoined\\nHelen.\",\n",
       " 'Dale lifted his head alertly.',\n",
       " '“Listen.”',\n",
       " \"The girls grew tense and still. Helen could not hear a sound, unless it\\nwas a low thud of hoof out in the gloom. The forest seemed sleeping. She\\nknew from Bo's eyes, wide and shining in the camp fire light, that she,\\ntoo, had failed to catch whatever it was Dale meant.\",\n",
       " \"“Bunch of coyotes comin',” he explained.\",\n",
       " 'Suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy, high strung, strange\\nbarks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or\\ninquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at the\\nedge of the circle of light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded\\nthe camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a\\nrestless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after\\nthe chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes\\nwent away.',\n",
       " \"Silence again settled down. If it had not been for the anxiety always\\npresent in Helen's mind she would have thought this silence sweet and\\nunfamiliarly beautiful.\",\n",
       " '“Ah! Listen to that fellow,” spoke up Dale. His voice was thrilling.',\n",
       " 'Again the girls strained their ears. That was not necessary, for\\npresently, clear and cold out of the silence, pealed a mournful howl,\\nlong drawn, strange and full and wild.',\n",
       " \"“Oh! What's that?” whispered Bo.\",\n",
       " \"“That's a big gray wolf  a timber wolf, or lofer, as he's sometimes\\ncalled,” replied Dale. “He's high on some rocky ridge back there. He\\nscents us, an' he doesn't like it... There he goes again. Listen! Ah,\\nhe's hungry.”\",\n",
       " 'While Helen listened to this exceedingly wild cry  so wild that it made\\nher flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come\\nover her  she kept her glance upon Dale.',\n",
       " '“You love him?” she murmured involuntarily, quite without understanding\\nthe motive of her query.',\n",
       " 'Assuredly Dale had never had that question asked of him before, and\\nit seemed to Helen, as he pondered, that he had never even asked it of\\nhimself.',\n",
       " '“I reckon so,” he replied, presently.',\n",
       " '“But wolves kill deer, and little fawns, and everything helpless in the\\nforest,” expostulated Bo.',\n",
       " 'The hunter nodded his head.',\n",
       " '“Why, then, can you love him?” repeated Helen.',\n",
       " \"“Come to think of it, I reckon it's because of lots of reasons,”\\n returned Dale. “He kills clean. He eats no carrion. He's no coward. He\\nfights. He dies game... An' he likes to be alone.”\",\n",
       " '“Kills clean. What do you mean by that?”',\n",
       " \"“A cougar, now, he mangles a deer. An' a silvertip, when killin' a\\ncow or colt, he makes a mess of it. But a wolf kills clean, with sharp\\nsnaps.”\",\n",
       " '“What are a cougar and a silvertip?”',\n",
       " \"“Cougar means mountain lion or panther, an' a silvertip is a grizzly\\nbear.”\",\n",
       " \"“Oh, they're all cruel!” exclaimed Helen, shrinking.\",\n",
       " \"“I reckon. Often I've shot wolves for relayin' a deer.”\",\n",
       " \"“What's that?”\",\n",
       " \"“Sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer, an' while one of them\\nrests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner, who'll, take\\nup the chase. That way they run the deer down. Cruel it is, but nature,\\nan' no worse than snow an' ice that starve deer, or a fox that kills\\nturkey chicks breakin' out of the egg, or ravens that pick the eyes out\\nof new born lambs an' wait till they die. An' for that matter, men are\\ncrueler than beasts of prey, for men add to nature, an' have more than\\ninstincts.”\",\n",
       " \"Helen was silenced, as well as shocked. She had not only learned a new\\nand striking viewpoint in natural history, but a clear intimation to the\\nreason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in\\nthis man. A hunter was one who killed animals for their fur, for their\\nmeat or horns, or for some lust for blood  that was Helen's definition\\nof a hunter, and she believed it was held by the majority of people\\nliving in settled states. But the majority might be wrong. A hunter\\nmight be vastly different, and vastly more than a tracker and slayer\\nof game. The mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men.\\nPerhaps Dale knew its secrets, its life, its terror, its beauty, its\\nsadness, and its joy; and if so, how full, how wonderful must be his\\nmind! He spoke of men as no better than wolves. Could a lonely life\\nin the wilderness teach a man that? Bitterness, envy, jealousy, spite,\\ngreed, and hate  these had no place in this hunter's heart. It was not\\nHelen's shrewdness, but a woman's intuition, which divined that.\",\n",
       " 'Dale rose to his feet and, turning his ear to the north, listened once\\nmore.',\n",

       " \"“No, it ain't likely he'll turn up to night,” replied Dale, and then he\\nstrode over to put a hand on the pine tree that soared above where the\\ngirls lay. His action, and the way he looked up at the tree top and then\\nat adjacent trees, held more of that significance which so interested\\nHelen.\",\n",
       " \"“I reckon he's stood there some five hundred years an' will stand\\nthrough to night,” muttered Dale.\",\n",

       " 'A few drops of cold rain fell upon her face, thrilling her with the\\nproof that no roof stood between her and the elements.

The roar that had seemed distant was now\\nback in the forest, coming swiftly, increasing in volume. Like a\\nstream in flood it bore down. Helen grew amazed, startled. How rushing,\\noncoming, and heavy this storm wind! She likened its approach to the\\ntread of an army. Then the roar filled the forest, yet it was back there\\nbehind her. Not a pine needle quivered in the light of the camp fire.\\nBut the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge. The roar\\naugmented till it was no longer a roar, but an on sweeping crash, like\\nan ocean torrent engulfing the earth. Bo awoke to cling to Helen\\nwith fright. The deafening storm blast was upon them. Helen felt the\\nsaddle pillow move under her head. The giant pine had trembled to its\\nvery roots. That mighty fury of wind was all aloft, in the tree tops.\\nAnd for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power.\\nThen the deafening crash passed to roar, and that swept on and on,\\nlessening in volume, deepening in low detonation, at last to die in the\\ndistance.',\n",
       " 'No sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and\\nceased and rose again. Helen lay there, whispering to Bo, and heard\\nagain the great wave of wind come and crash and cease. That was the way\\nof this storm wind of the mountain forest.',\n",
       " \"A soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned Helen to remember Dale's\\ndirections, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike\\nover the saddle.

       " \"“Then I've got to hide tracks certain  rustle to my camp an' stay there\\ntill you say it's safe to risk takin' the girls to Pine.”\",\n",
       " \"“Milt, you're talkin' the wisdom of the prophets.”\",\n",
       " \"“I ain't so sure we can hide tracks altogether. If Anson had any eyes\\nfor the woods he'd not have lost me so soon.\",\n",
       " \"“No. But, you see, he's figgerin' to cross your trail.”\",\n",
       " \"“If I could get fifteen or twenty mile farther on an' hide tracks\\ncertain, I'd feel safe from pursuit, anyway,” said the hunter,\\nreflectively.\",\n",
       " \"“Shore an' easy,” responded Roy, quickly. “I jest met up with some\\ngreaser sheep herders drivin' a big flock. They've come up from the\\nsouth an' are goin' to fatten up at Turkey Senacas. Then they'll drive\\nback south an' go on to Phenix. Wal, it's muddy weather. Now you break\\ncamp quick an' make a plain trail out to thet sheep trail, as if you\\nwas travelin' south. But, instead, you ride round ahead of thet flock of\\nsheep. They'll keep to the open parks an' the trails through them necks\\nof woods out here. An', passin' over your tracks, they'll hide 'em.”\",\n",
       " \"“But supposin' Anson circles an' hits this camp? He'll track me easy out\\nto that sheep trail. What then?”\",\n",
       " \"“Jest what you want. Goin' south thet sheep trail is downhill an' muddy.\\nIt's goin' to rain hard. Your tracks would get washed out even if you\\ndid go south. An' Anson would keep on thet way till he was clear off the\\nscent. Leave it to me, Milt. You're a hunter. But I'm a hoss tracker.”\",\n",
       " \"“All right. We'll rustle.”\",\n",
       " 'Then he called the girls to hurry.',\n",

       " 'CHAPTER VIII',\n",
       " 'Once astride the horse again, Helen had to congratulate herself upon not\\nbeing so crippled as she had imagined. Indeed, Bo made all the audible\\ncomplaints.',\n",
       " 'Both girls had long water proof coats, brand new, and of which they were\\nconsiderably proud. New clothes had not been a common event in their\\nlives.',\n",
       " \"“Reckon I'll have to slit these,” Dale had said, whipping out a huge\\nknife.\",\n",
       " \"“What for?” had been Bo's feeble protest.\",\n",
       " \"“They wasn't made for ridin'. An' you'll get wet enough even if I do cut\\nthem. An' if I don't, you'll get soaked.”\",\n",
       " \"“Go ahead,” had been Helen's reluctant permission.\",\n",
       " 'So their long new coats were slit half way up the back. The exigency of\\nthe case was manifest to Helen, when she saw how they came down over the\\ncantles of the saddles and to their boot tops.',\n",
       " \"The morning was gray and cold. A fine, misty rain fell and the trees\\ndripped steadily. Helen was surprised to see the open country again and\\nthat apparently they were to leave the forest behind for a while. The\\ncountry was wide and flat on the right, and to the left it rolled and\\nheaved along a black, scalloped timber line. Above this bordering of\\nthe forest low, drifting clouds obscured the mountains. The wind was at\\nHelen's back and seemed to be growing stronger. Dale and Roy were ahead,\\ntraveling at a good trot, with the pack animals bunched before them.\\nHelen and Bo had enough to do to keep up.\",\n",
       " \"The first hour's ride brought little change in weather or scenery, but\\nit gave Helen an inkling of what she must endure if they kept that up\\nall day. She began to welcome the places where the horses walked, but\\nshe disliked the levels. As for the descents, she hated those. Ranger\\nwould not go down slowly and the shake up she received was unpleasant.\\nMoreover, the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and\\nwashes. He sailed over them like a bird. Helen could not acquire the\\nknack of sitting the saddle properly, and so, not only was her person\\nbruised on these occasions, but her feelings were hurt. Helen had\\nnever before been conscious of vanity. Still, she had never rejoiced\\nin looking at a disadvantage, and her exhibitions here must have been\\nfrightful. Bo always would forge to the front, and she seldom looked\\nback, for which Helen was grateful.\",\n",
       " 'Before long they struck into a broad, muddy belt, full of innumerable\\nsmall hoof tracks. This, then, was the sheep trail Roy had advised\\nfollowing. They rode on it for three or four miles, and at length,\\ncoming to a gray green valley, they saw a huge flock of sheep. Soon the\\nair was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep, and a\\nlow, soft roar of pattering hoofs. The flock held a compact formation,\\ncovering several acres, and grazed along rapidly. There were three\\nherders on horses and several pack burros. Dale engaged one of the\\nMexicans in conversation, and passed something to him, then pointed\\nnorthward and down along the trail. The Mexican grinned from ear to ear,\\nand Helen caught the quick “SI, SENOR! GRACIAS, SENOR!” It was a pretty\\nsight, that flock of sheep, as it rolled along like a rounded woolly\\nstream of grays and browns and here and there a black. They were keeping\\nto a trail over the flats. Dale headed into this trail and, if anything,\\ntrotted a little faster.',\n",
       " 'Presently the clouds lifted and broke, showing blue sky and one streak\\nof sunshine. But the augury was without warrant. The wind increased. A\\nhuge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that\\ncould be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a\\nswiftly moving wall. Soon it enveloped the fugitives.',\n",
       " \"With head bowed, Helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold, gray\\nrain that blew almost on a level. Finally the heavy downpour passed,\\nleaving a fine mist. The clouds scurried low and dark, hiding the\\nmountains altogether and making the gray, wet plain a dreary sight.\\nHelen's feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water. And\\nthey were cold. Her gloves, too, had not been intended for rain, and\\nthey were wet through. The cold bit at her fingers so that she had to\\nbeat her hands together. Ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was\\nto trot faster, which event was worse for Helen than freezing.\",\n",
       " \"She saw another black, scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its\\ntrailing sheets of rain, and this one appeared streaked with white.\\nSnow! The wind was now piercingly cold. Helen's body kept warm, but\\nher extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly. She gazed ahead\\ngrimly. There was no help; she had to go on. Dale and Roy were hunched\\ndown in their saddles, probably wet through, for they wore no rain proof\\ncoats. Bo kept close behind them, and plain it was that she felt the\\ncold.\",\n",
       " \"This second storm was not so bad as the first, because there was less\\nrain. Still, the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow. It lasted\\nfor an hour, during which the horses trotted on, trotted on. Again the\\ngray torrent roared away, the fine mist blew, the clouds lifted and\\nseparated, and, closing again, darkened for another onslaught. This one\\nbrought sleet. The driving pellets stung Helen's neck and cheeks, and\\nfor a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was\\nafraid she could not hold up under them. The bare places on the ground\\nshowed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice.\",\n",
       " \"Thus, storm after storm rolled over Helen's head. Her feet grew numb\\nand ceased to hurt. But her fingers, because of her ceaseless efforts\\nto keep up the circulation, retained the stinging pain. And now the wind\\npierced right through her. She marveled at her endurance, and there were\\nmany times that she believed she could not ride farther. Yet she kept\\non. All the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as\\nthis. Hard and cold, wet and windy, at an increasing elevation  that was\\nthe explanation. The air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood.\",\n",
       " 'Still, during all those interminable hours, Helen watched where she was\\ntraveling, and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize\\nit. The afternoon appeared far advanced when Dale and Roy led down into\\nan immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats. They rode\\nalong its margin, splashing up to the knees of the horses. Cranes and\\nherons flew on with lumbering motion; flocks of ducks winged swift\\nflight from one side to the other. Beyond this depression the land\\nsloped rather abruptly; outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of\\nthe highest ground, and again a dark fringe of trees appeared.',\n",
       " 'How many miles! wondered Helen. They seemed as many and as long as\\nthe hours. But at last, just as another hard rain came, the pines\\nwere reached. They proved to be widely scattered and afforded little\\nprotection from the storm.',\n",
       " 'Helen sat her saddle, a dead weight. Whenever Ranger quickened his gait\\nor crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling\\noff. Her mind harbored only sensations of misery, and a persistent\\nthought  why did she ever leave home for the West? Her solicitude for Bo\\nhad been forgotten. Nevertheless, any marked change in the topography\\nof the country was registered, perhaps photographed on her memory by the\\ntorturing vividness of her experience.',\n",
       " \"The forest grew more level and denser. Shadows of twilight or gloom lay\\nunder the trees. Presently Dale and Roy, disappeared, going downhill,\\nand likewise Bo. Then Helen's ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid\\nwater. Ranger trotted faster. Soon Helen came to the edge of a great\\nvalley, black and gray, so full of obscurity that she could not see\\nacross or down into it. But she knew there was a rushing river at\\nthe bottom. The sound was deep, continuous, a heavy, murmuring roar,\\nsingularly musical. The trail was steep. Helen had not lost all feeling,\\nas she had believed and hoped. Her poor, mistreated body still responded\\nexcruciatingly to concussions, jars, wrenches, and all the other\\nhorrible movements making up a horse trot.\",\n",
       " 'For long Helen did not look up. When she did so there lay a green,\\nwillow bordered, treeless space at the bottom of the valley, through\\nwhich a brown white stream rushed with steady, ear filling roar.',\n",
       " 'Dale and Roy drove the pack animals across the stream, and followed,\\ngoing deep to the flanks of their horses. Bo rode into the foaming water\\nas if she had been used to it all her days. A slip, a fall, would have\\nmeant that Bo must drown in that mountain torrent.',\n",
       " \"Ranger trotted straight to the edge, and there, obedient to Helen's\\nclutch on the bridle, he halted. The stream was fifty feet wide, shallow\\non the near side, deep on the opposite, with fast current and big waves.\\nHelen was simply too frightened to follow.\",\n",
       " '“Let him come!” yelled Dale. “Stick on now!... Ranger!”',\n",
       " 'The big black plunged in, making the water fly. That stream was nothing\\nfor him, though it seemed impassable to Helen. She had not the strength\\nleft to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them. Ranger, in two\\nmore plunges, surmounted the bank, and then, trotting across the green\\nto where the other horses stood steaming under some pines, he gave a\\ngreat heave and halted.',\n",
       " 'Roy reached up to help her off.',\n",
       " '“Thirty miles, Miss Helen,” he said, and the way he spoke was a\\ncompliment.',\n",
       " 'He had to lift her off and help her to the tree where Bo leaned. Dale\\nhad ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddle blankets on the ground\\nunder the pine.',\n",
       " \"“Nell  you swore  you loved me!” was Bo's mournful greeting. The girl\\nwas pale, drawn, blue lipped, and she could not stand up.\",\n",
       " \"“Bo, I never did  or I'd never have brought you to this  wretch that I\\nam!” cried Helen. “Oh, what a horrible ride!”\",\n",
       " 'Rain was falling, the trees were dripping, the sky was lowering. All the\\nground was soaking wet, with pools and puddles everywhere. Helen could\\nimagine nothing but a heartless, dreary, cold prospect. Just then home\\nwas vivid and poignant in her thoughts. Indeed, so utterly miserable\\nwas she that the exquisite relief of sitting down, of a cessation of\\nmovement, of a release from that infernal perpetual trotting horse,\\nseemed only a mockery. It could not be true that the time had come for\\nrest.',\n",
       " \"Evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheep herders,\\nfor there were remains of a fire. Dale lifted the burnt end of a log\\nand brought it down hard upon the ground, splitting off pieces. Several\\ntimes he did this. It was amazing to see his strength, his facility, as\\nhe split off handfuls of splinters. He collected a bundle of them, and,\\nlaying them down, he bent over them. Roy wielded the ax on another log,\\nand each stroke split off a long strip. Then a tiny column of smoke\\ndrifted up over Dale's shoulder as he leaned, bareheaded, sheltering the\\nsplinters with his hat. A blaze leaped up. Roy came with an armful of\\nstrips all white and dry, out of the inside of a log. Crosswise these\\nwere laid over the blaze, and it began to roar. Then piece by piece the\\nmen built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods, branches\\nand stumps and logs, erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke\\nroared upward. It had not taken two minutes. Already Helen felt the\\nwarmth on her icy face. She held up her bare, numb hands.\",\n",
       " 'Both Dale and Roy were wet through to the skin, yet they did not tarry\\nbeside the fire. They relieved the horses. A lasso went up between two\\npines, and a tarpaulin over it, V shaped and pegged down at the four\\nends. The packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and\\nbedding were placed under this shelter.',\n",
       " 'Helen thought this might have taken five minutes more. In this short\\nspace of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot.\\nRain was falling steadily all around, but over and near that roaring\\nblaze, ten feet high, no water fell. It evaporated. The ground began to\\nsteam and to dry. Helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out\\nthe cold. But presently the pain ceased.',\n",
       " '“Nell, I never knew before how good a fire could feel,” declared Bo.',\n",
       " \"And therein lay more food for Helen's reflection.\",\n",
       " 'In ten minutes Helen was dry and hot. Darkness came down upon the\\ndreary, sodden forest, but that great camp fire made it a different\\nworld from the one Helen had anticipated. It blazed and roared, cracked\\nlike a pistol, hissed and sputtered, shot sparks everywhere, and sent\\naloft a dense, yellow, whirling column of smoke. It began to have a\\nheart of gold.',\n",
       " 'Dale took a long pole and raked out a pile of red embers upon which the\\ncoffee pot and oven soon began to steam.',\n",
       " '“Roy, I promised the girls turkey to night,” said the hunter.',\n",
       " \"“Mebbe to morrow, if the wind shifts. This 's turkey country.”\",\n",
       " \"“Roy, a potato will do me!” exclaimed Bo. “Never again will I ask for\\ncake and pie! I never appreciated good things to eat. And I've been a\\nlittle pig, always. I never  never knew what it was to be hungry  until\\nnow.”\",\n",
       " 'Dale glanced up quickly.',\n",
       " \"“Lass, it's worth learnin',” he said.\",\n",
       " \"Helen's thought was too deep for words. In such brief space had she been\\ntransformed from misery to comfort!\",\n",
       " 'The rain kept on falling, though it appeared to grow softer as night\\nsettled down black. The wind died away and the forest was still, except\\nfor the steady roar of the stream. A folded tarpaulin was laid between\\nthe pine and the fire, well in the light and warmth, and upon it the\\nmen set steaming pots and plates and cups, the fragrance from which was\\nstrong and inviting.',\n",
       " \"“Fetch the saddle blanket an' set with your backs to the fire,” said\\nRoy.\",\n",
       " '\\nLater, when the girls were tucked away snugly in their blankets and\\nsheltered from the rain, Helen remained awake after Bo had fallen\\nasleep. The big blaze made the improvised tent as bright as day. She\\ncould see the smoke, the trunk of the big pine towering aloft, and\\na blank space of sky. The stream hummed a song, seemingly musical at\\ntimes, and then discordant and dull, now low, now roaring, and always\\nrushing, gurgling, babbling, flowing, chafing in its hurry.',\n",
       " 'Presently the hunter and his friend returned from hobbling the horses,\\nand beside the fire they conversed in low tones.',\n",

       " 'by Zane Grey',\n",
       " 'New York',\n",
       " 'Published: 1919',\n",
       " 'At sunset hour the forest was still, lonely, sweet with tang of fir and\\nspruce, blazing in gold and red and green; and the man who glided on\\nunder the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and, disappearing,\\nto have become a part of the wild woodland.',\n",
       " 'Old Baldy, highest of the White Mountains, stood up round and bare,\\nrimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun. Then, as the\\nfire dropped behind the domed peak, a change, a cold and darkening\\nblight, passed down the black spear pointed slopes over all that\\nmountain world.',\n",
       " 'September in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze\\nfollowing shortly after sundown. Twilight appeared to come on its wings,\\nas did faint sounds, not distinguishable before in the stillness.',\n",
       " \"To Dale's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been,\\nbetokening an unchanged serenity of forestland. He was glad, for he had\\nexpected to hear the clipclop of white men's horses  which to hear up\\nin those fastnesses was hateful to him. He and the Indian were friends.\\nThat fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter. But there hid\\nsomewhere in the forest a gang of bad men, sheep thieves, whom Dale did\\nnot want to meet.\",\n",
       " \"As he started out upon the slope, a sudden flaring of the afterglow of\\nsunset flooded down from Old Baldy, filling the valley with lights and\\nshadows, yellow and blue, like the radiance of the sky. The pools in the\\ncurves of the brook shone darkly bright. Dale's gaze swept up and down\\nthe valley, and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook\\nwhere the wall of spruce stood up, its speared and spiked crest against\\nthe pale clouds. The wind began to moan in the trees and there was a\\nfeeling of rain in the air. Dale, striking a trail, turned his back to\\nthe fading afterglow and strode down the valley.\",\n",
       " 'With night at hand and a rain storm brewing, he did not head for his\\nown camp, some miles distant, but directed his steps toward an old log\\ncabin. When he reached it darkness had almost set in. He approached with\\ncaution. This cabin, like the few others scattered in the valleys, might\\nharbor Indians or a bear or a panther. Nothing, however, appeared to be\\nthere. Then Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky, and he felt\\nthe cool dampness of a fine, misty rain on his face. It would rain off\\nand on during the night. Whereupon he entered the cabin.',\n",
       " 'And the next moment he heard quick hoof beats of trotting horses.\\nPeering out, he saw dim, moving forms in the darkness, quite close\\nat hand. They had approached against the wind so that sound had been\\ndeadened. Five horses with riders, Dale made out  saw them loom close.\\nThen he heard rough voices. Quickly he turned to feel in the dark for a\\nladder he knew led to a loft; and finding it, he quickly mounted, taking\\ncare not to make a noise with his rifle, and lay down upon the floor\\nof brush and poles. Scarcely had he done so when heavy steps, with\\naccompaniment of clinking spurs, passed through the door below into the\\ncabin.',\n",
       " '“Wal, Beasley, are you here?” queried a loud voice.',\n",
       " 'There was no reply. The man below growled under his breath, and again\\nthe spurs jingled.',\n",
       " \"“Fellars, Beasley ain't here yet,” he called. “Put the hosses under the\\nshed. We'll wait.”\",\n",
       " \"“Wait, huh!” came a harsh reply. “Mebbe all night  an' we got nuthin' to\\neat.”\",\n",
       " \"“Shut up, Moze. Reckon you're no good for anythin' but eatin'. Put them\\nhosses away an' some of you rustle fire wood in here.”\",\n",
       " 'Another shuffling, clinking footstep entered the cabin.',\n",
       " \"“Snake, it'd been sense to fetch a pack along,” drawled this newcomer.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon so, Jim. But we didn't, an' what's the use hollerin'? Beasley\\nwon't keep us waitin' long.”\",\n",
       " 'Other men entered the cabin.',\n",
       " \"“It ain't a goin' to rain much,” said one. Then came a crash of wood\\nthrown to the ground.\",\n",
       " \"“Jim, hyar's a chunk of pine log, dry as punk,” said another.\",\n",
       " 'Rustlings and slow footsteps, and then heavy thuds attested to the\\nprobability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to\\nsplit off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured.',\n",
       " \"“Snake, lemme your pipe, an' I'll hev a fire in a jiffy.”\",\n",
       " \"“Wal, I want my terbacco an' I ain't carin' about no fire,” replied\\nSnake.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon you're the meanest cuss in these woods,” drawled Jim.\",\n",
       " \"Sharp click of steel on flint  many times  and then a sound of hard\\nblowing and sputtering told of Jim's efforts to start a fire. Presently\\nthe pitchy blackness of the cabin changed; there came a little crackling\\nof wood and the rustle of flame, and then a steady growing roar.\",\n",
       " 'As it chanced, Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft, and right\\nnear his eyes there were cracks between the boughs. When the fire blazed\\nup he was fairly well able to see the men below. The only one he had\\never seen was Jim Wilson, who had been well known at Pine before Snake\\nAnson had ever been heard of. Jim was the best of a bad lot, and he had\\nfriends among the honest people. It was rumored that he and Snake did\\nnot pull well together.',\n",
       " \"“Fire feels good,” said the burly Moze, who appeared as broad as he was\\nblack visaged. “Fall's sure a comin'... Now if only we had some grub!”\",\n",
       " \"“Moze, there's a hunk of deer meat in my saddle bag, an' if you git it\\nyou can have half,” spoke up another voice.\",\n",
       " \"“Snake, what's this here deal with Beasley?” inquired Jim.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon you'll l'arn when I do,” replied the leader. He appeared tired\\nand thoughtful.\",\n",
       " \"“Ain't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herders  for\\nnothin'?” queried the youngest of the gang, a boy in years, whose hard,\\nbitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades.\",\n",
       " \"“You're dead right, Burt  an' that's my stand,” replied the man who\\nhad sent Moze out. “Snake, snow 'll be flyin' round these woods before\\nlong,” said Jim Wilson. “Are we goin' to winter down in the Tonto Basin\\nor over on the Gila?”\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon we'll do some tall ridin' before we strike south,” replied\\nSnake, gruffly.\",\n",
       " 'At the juncture Moze returned.',\n",
       " \"“Boss, I heerd a hoss comin' up the trail,” he said.\",\n",
       " 'Snake rose and stood at the door, listening. Outside the wind moaned\\nfitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin.',\n",
       " '“A huh!” exclaimed Snake, in relief.',\n",
       " 'Silence ensued then for a moment, at the end of which interval Dale\\nheard a rapid clip clop on the rocky trail outside. The men below\\nshuffled uneasily, but none of them spoke. The fire cracked cheerily.\\nSnake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that\\nexpressed both doubt and caution.',\n",
       " 'The trotting horse had halted out there somewhere.',\n",
       " '“Ho there, inside!” called a voice from the darkness.',\n",
       " '“Ho yourself!” replied Anson.',\n",
       " '“That you, Snake?” quickly followed the query.',\n",
       " '“Reckon so,” returned Anson, showing himself.',\n",
       " 'The newcomer entered. He was a large man, wearing a slicker that shone\\nwet in the firelight. His sombrero, pulled well down, shadowed his face,\\nso that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked.\\nHe had a black, drooping mustache, and a chin like a rock. A potential\\nforce, matured and powerful, seemed to be wrapped in his movements.',\n",
       " \"“Hullo, Snake! Hullo, Wilson!” he said. “I've backed out on the other\\ndeal. Sent for you on  on another little matter... particular private.”\",\n",
       " \"Here he indicated with a significant gesture that Snake's men were to\\nleave the cabin.\",\n",
       " \"“A huh! ejaculated Anson, dubiously. Then he turned abruptly. Moze,\\nyou an' Shady an' Burt go wait outside. Reckon this ain't the deal I\\nexpected... An' you can saddle the hosses.”\",\n",
       " 'The three members of the gang filed out, all glancing keenly at the\\nstranger, who had moved back into the shadow.',\n",
       " \"“All right now, Beasley,” said Anson, low voiced. “What's your game?\\nJim, here, is in on my deals.”\",\n",
       " 'Then Beasley came forward to the fire, stretching his hands to the\\nblaze.',\n",
       " \"“Nothin' to do with sheep,” replied he.\",\n",
       " \"“Wal, I reckoned not,” assented the other. “An' say  whatever your game\\nis, I ain't likin' the way you kept me waitin' an' ridin' around. We\\nwaited near all day at Big Spring. Then thet greaser rode up an' sent us\\nhere. We're a long way from camp with no grub an' no blankets.”\",\n",
       " \"“I won't keep you long,” said Beasley. “But even if I did you'd not\\nmind  when I tell you this deal concerns Al Auchincloss  the man who\\nmade an outlaw of you!”\",\n",
       " \"Anson's sudden action then seemed a leap of his whole frame. Wilson,\\nlikewise, bent forward eagerly. Beasley glanced at the door  then began\\nto whisper.\",\n",
       " \"“Old Auchincloss is on his last legs. He's goin' to croak. He's sent\\nback to Missouri for a niece  a young girl  an' he means to leave his\\nranches an' sheep  all his stock to her. Seems he has no one else...\\nThem ranches  an' all them sheep an' hosses! You know me an' Al were\\npardners in sheep raisin' for years. He swore I cheated him an' he threw\\nme out. An' all these years I've been swearin' he did me dirt  owed me\\nsheep an' money. I've got as many friends in Pine  an' all the way down\\nthe trail  as Auchincloss has... An' Snake, see here  ”\",\n",
       " 'He paused to draw a deep breath and his big hands trembled over the\\nblaze. Anson leaned forward, like a serpent ready to strike, and Jim\\nWilson was as tense with his divination of the plot at hand.',\n",
       " \"“See here,” panted Beasley. “The girl's due to arrive at Magdalena on\\nthe sixteenth. That's a week from to morrow. She'll take the stage to\\nSnowdrop, where some of Auchincloss's men will meet her with a team.”\",\n",
       " \"“A huh!” grunted Anson as Beasley halted again. “An' what of all thet?”\",\n",
       " \"“She mustn't never get as far as Snowdrop!”\",\n",
       " \"“You want me to hold up the stage  an' get the girl?”\",\n",
       " '“Exactly.”',\n",
       " \"“Wal  an' what then?”\",\n",
       " \"“Make off with her... She disappears. That's your affair. ... I'll\\npress my claims on Auchincloss  hound him  an' be ready when he croaks\\nto take over his property. Then the girl can come back, for all I\\ncare... You an' Wilson fix up the deal between you. If you have to let\\nthe gang in on it don't give them any hunch as to who an' what. This 'll\\nmake you a rich stake. An' providin', when it's paid, you strike for new\\nterritory.”\",\n",
       " '“Thet might be wise,” muttered Snake Anson. “Beasley, the weak point in\\nyour game is the uncertainty of life. Old Al is tough. He may fool you.”',\n",
       " \"“Auchincloss is a dyin' man,” declared Beasley, with such positiveness\\nthat it could not be doubted.\",\n",
       " \"“Wal, he sure wasn't plumb hearty when I last seen him... Beasley, in\\ncase I play your game  how'm I to know that girl?”\",\n",
       " \"“Her name's Helen Rayner,” replied Beasley, eagerly. “She's twenty\\nyears old. All of them Auchinclosses was handsome an' they say she's the\\nhandsomest.”\",\n",
       " \"“A huh!... Beasley, this 's sure a bigger deal  an' one I ain't\\nfancyin'... But I never doubted your word... Come on  an' talk out.\\nWhat's in it for me?”\",\n",
       " \"“Don't let any one in on this. You two can hold up the stage. Why, it\\nwas never held up... But you want to mask... How about ten thousand\\nsheep  or what they bring at Phenix in gold?”\",\n",
       " 'Jim Wilson whistled low.',\n",
       " \"“An' leave for new territory?” repeated Snake Anson, under his breath.\",\n",
       " \"“You've said it.”\",\n",
       " \"“Wal, I ain't fancyin' the girl end of this deal, but you can count on\\nme... September sixteenth at Magdalena  an' her name's Helen  an' she's\\nhandsome?”\",\n",
       " \"“Yes. My herders will begin drivin' south in about two weeks. Later, if\\nthe weather holds good, send me word by one of them an' I'll meet you.”\",\n",
       " 'Beasley spread his hands once more over the blaze, pulled on his gloves\\nand pulled down his sombrero, and with an abrupt word of parting strode\\nout into the night.',\n",
       " '“Jim, what do you make of him?” queried Snake Anson.',\n",
       " \"“Pard, he's got us beat two ways for Sunday,” replied Wilson.\",\n",
       " \"“A huh!... Wal, let's get back to camp.” And he led the way out.\",\n",
       " 'He was thirty years old. As a boy of fourteen he had run off from his\\nschool and home in Iowa and, joining a wagon train of pioneers, he was\\none of the first to see log cabins built on the slopes of the White\\nMountains. But he had not taken kindly to farming or sheep raising or\\nmonotonous home toil, and for twelve years he had lived in the forest,\\nwith only infrequent visits to Pine and Show Down and Snowdrop. This\\nwandering forest life of his did not indicate that he did not care for\\nthe villagers, for he did care, and he was welcome everywhere, but\\nthat he loved wild life and solitude and beauty with the primitive\\ninstinctive force of a savage.',\n",
       " 'And on this night he had stumbled upon a dark plot against the only one\\nof all the honest white people in that region whom he could not call a\\nfriend.',\n",
       " \"“That man Beasley!” he soliloquized. “Beasley  in cahoots with Snake\\nAnson!... Well, he was right. Al Auchincloss is on his last legs. Poor\\nold man! When I tell him he'll never believe ME, that's sure!”\",\n",
       " '“A girl  Helen Rayner  twenty years old,” he mused. “Beasley wants her\\nmade off with... That means  worse than killed!”',\n",
       " '“Strange how I cut across country to day from Spruce Swamp,” reflected\\nDale. Circumstances, movements, usually were not strange to him. His\\nmethods and habits were seldom changed by chance. The matter, then, of\\nhis turning off a course out of his way for no apparent reason, and\\nof his having overheard a plot singularly involving a young girl, was\\nindeed an adventure to provoke thought. It provoked more, for Dale grew\\nconscious of an unfamiliar smoldering heat along his veins. He who had\\nlittle to do with the strife of men, and nothing to do with anger, felt\\nhis blood grow hot at the cowardly trap laid for an innocent girl.',\n",
       " \"“Old Al won't listen to me,” pondered Dale. “An' even if he did, he\\nwouldn't believe me. Maybe nobody will... All the same, Snake Anson\\nwon't get that girl.”\",\n",
       " 'With these last words Dale satisfied himself of his own position, and\\nhis pondering ceased. Taking his rifle, he descended from the loft and\\npeered out of the door. The night had grown darker, windier, cooler;\\nbroken clouds were scudding across the sky; only a few stars showed;\\nfine rain was blowing from the northwest; and the forest seemed full of\\na low, dull roar.',\n",
       " \"“Reckon I'd better hang up here,” he said, and turned to the fire. The\\ncoals were red now. From the depths of his hunting coat he procured a\\nlittle bag of salt and some strips of dried meat. These strips he laid\\nfor a moment on the hot embers, until they began to sizzle and curl;\\nthen with a sharpened stick he removed them and ate like a hungry hunter\\ngrateful for little.\",\n",
       " 'He sat on a block of wood with his palms spread to the dying warmth of\\nthe fire and his eyes fixed upon the changing, glowing, golden embers.\\nOutside, the wind continued to rise and the moan of the forest increased\\nto a roar. Dale felt the comfortable warmth stealing over him, drowsily\\nlulling; and he heard the storm wind in the trees, now like a waterfall,\\nand anon like a retreating army, and again low and sad; and he saw\\npictures in the glowing embers, strange as dreams.',\n",
       " 'Presently he rose and, climbing to the loft, he stretched himself out,\\nand soon fell asleep.',\n",
       " \"This was always the happiest moment of Dale's lonely days, as sunset\\nwas his saddest. He responded, and there was something in his blood that\\nanswered the whistle of a stag from a near by ridge. His strides were\\nlong, noiseless, and they left dark trace where his feet brushed the\\ndew laden grass.\",\n",
       " 'At length he got down into the pine belt, where the great, gnarled,\\nyellow trees soared aloft, stately, and aloof from one another, and the\\nground was a brown, odorous, springy mat of pine needles, level as a\\nfloor. Squirrels watched him from all around, scurrying away at his\\nnear approach  tiny, brown, light striped squirrels, and larger ones,\\nrusset colored, and the splendid dark grays with their white bushy tails\\nand plumed ears.',\n",
       " 'This belt of pine ended abruptly upon wide, gray, rolling, open land,\\nalmost like a prairie, with foot hills lifting near and far, and the\\nred gold blaze of aspen thickets catching the morning sun. Here Dale\\nflushed a flock of wild turkeys, upward of forty in number, and their\\nsubdued color of gray flecked with white, and graceful, sleek build,\\nshowed them to be hens. There was not a gobbler in the flock. They began\\nto run pell mell out into the grass, until only their heads appeared\\nbobbing along, and finally disappeared. Dale caught a glimpse of\\nskulking coyotes that evidently had been stalking the turkeys, and as\\nthey saw him and darted into the timber he took a quick shot at the\\nhindmost. His bullet struck low, as he had meant it to, but too low, and\\nthe coyote got only a dusting of earth and pine needles thrown up into\\nhis face. This frightened him so that he leaped aside blindly to butt\\ninto a tree, rolled over, gained his feet, and then the cover of the\\nforest. Dale was amused at this. His hand was against all the predatory\\nbeasts of the forest, though he had learned that lion and bear and wolf\\nand fox were all as necessary to the great scheme of nature as were the\\ngentle, beautiful wild creatures upon which they preyed. But some he\\nloved better than others, and so he deplored the inexplicable cruelty.',\n",
       " 'He crossed the wide, grassy plain and struck another gradual descent\\nwhere aspens and pines crowded a shallow ravine and warm, sun lighted\\nglades bordered along a sparkling brook. Here he heard a turkey gobble,\\nand that was a signal for him to change his course and make a crouching,\\nsilent detour around a clump of aspens. In a sunny patch of grass\\na dozen or more big gobblers stood, all suspiciously facing in his\\ndirection, heads erect, with that wild aspect peculiar to their species.\\nOld wild turkey gobblers were the most difficult game to stalk. Dale\\nshot two of them. The others began to run like ostriches, thudding over\\nthe ground, spreading their wings, and with that running start launched\\ntheir heavy bodies into whirring flight. They flew low, at about the\\nheight of a man from the grass, and vanished in the woods.',\n",
       " 'The little hamlet of Pine lay on the last level of sparsely timbered\\nforest. A road, running parallel with a dark watered, swift flowing\\nstream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue\\nsmoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of oats, yellow\\nin the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted\\nwith horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site\\nappeared to be a natural clearing, for there was no evidence of cut\\ntimber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene,\\ntranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and\\nhappy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.',\n",
       " \"“Why, land's sakes, if it ain't Milt Dale!” she exclaimed, in welcome.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon it's me, Mrs. Cass,” he replied. “An' I've brought you a\\nturkey.”\",\n",
       " \"“Milt, you're that good boy who never forgits old Widow Cass... What\\na gobbler! First one I've seen this fall. My man Tom used to fetch home\\ngobblers like that... An' mebbe he'll come home again sometime.”\",\n",
       " 'Her husband, Tom Cass, had gone into the forest years before and had\\nnever returned. But the old woman always looked for him and never gave\\nup hope.',\n",
       " \"“Men have been lost in the forest an' yet come back,” replied Dale, as\\nhe had said to her many a time.\",\n",
       " '“Come right in. You air hungry, I know. Now, son, when last did you eat\\na fresh egg or a flapjack?”',\n",
       " '“You should remember,” he answered, laughing, as he followed her into a\\nsmall, clean kitchen.',\n",
       " \"“Laws a' me! An' thet's months ago,” she replied, shaking her gray head.\\n“Milt, you should give up that wild life  an' marry  an' have a home.”\",\n",
       " '“You always tell me that.”',\n",
       " \"“Yes, an' I'll see you do it yet... Now you set there, an' pretty soon\\nI'll give you thet to eat which 'll make your mouth water.”\",\n",
       " \"“What's the news, Auntie?” he asked.\",\n",
       " \"“Nary news in this dead place. Why, nobody's been to Snowdrop in two\\nweeks!... Sary Jones died, poor old soul  she's better off  an' one of\\nmy cows run away. Milt, she's wild when she gits loose in the woods.\\nAn' you'll have to track her, 'cause nobody else can. An' John Dakker's\\nheifer was killed by a lion, an' Lem Harden's fast hoss  you know his\\nfavorite  was stole by hoss thieves. Lem is jest crazy. An' that reminds\\nme, Milt, where's your big ranger, thet you'd never sell or lend?”\",\n",
       " '“My horses are up in the woods, Auntie; safe, I reckon, from\\nhorse thieves.”',\n",
       " \"“Well, that's a blessin'. We've had some stock stole this summer, Milt,\\nan' no mistake.”\",\n",
       " \"Thus, while preparing a meal for Dale, the old woman went on recounting\\nall that had happened in the little village since his last visit. Dale\\nenjoyed her gossip and quaint philosophy, and it was exceedingly good\\nto sit at her table. In his opinion, nowhere else could there have been\\nsuch butter and cream, such ham and eggs. Besides, she always had apple\\npie, it seemed, at any time he happened in; and apple pie was one of\\nDale's few regrets while up in the lonely forest.\",\n",
       " \"“How's old Al Auchincloss?” presently inquired Dale.\",\n",
       " \"“Poorly  poorly,” sighed Mrs. Cass. “But he tramps an' rides around\\nsame as ever. Al's not long for this world... An', Milt, that reminds\\nme  there's the biggest news you ever heard.”\",\n",
       " \"“You don't say so!” exclaimed Dale, to encourage the excited old woman.\",\n",
       " \"“Al has sent back to Saint Joe for his niece, Helen Rayner. She's to\\ninherit all his property. We've heard much of her  a purty lass, they\\nsay... Now, Milt Dale, here's your chance. Stay out of the woods an' go\\nto work... You can marry that girl!”\",\n",
       " '“No chance for me, Auntie,” replied Dale, smiling.',\n",

Because he loved\\nthe wild and preferred it to village and range life, they had classed\\nhim as not one of them. Some believed him lazy; others believed him\\nshiftless; others thought him an Indian in mind and habits; and there\\nwere many who called him slow witted.

Lem Harden came out of the store and appealed\\nto Dale to recover his stolen horse. Lem's brother wanted a wild running\\nmare tracked and brought home. Jesse Lyons wanted a colt broken, and\\nbroken with patience, not violence, as was the method of the hard riding\\nboys at Pine.

Near the house\\nthe hollowed halves of logs had been bound together, making a crude\\npipe. Water ran uphill in this case, one of the facts that made the\\nranch famous, as it had always been a wonder and delight to the small\\nboys of Pine.

       " 'Helen Rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twenty four\\nhours before she made an alarming discovery.',\n",
       " \"Accompanied by her sister Bo, a precocious girl of sixteen, Helen had\\nleft St. Joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at\\nhome, yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life\\nin the Far West. All her people had the pioneer spirit; love of change,\\naction, adventure, was in her blood. Then duty to a widowed mother\\nwith a large and growing family had called to Helen to accept this rich\\nuncle's offer. She had taught school and also her little brothers and\\nsisters; she had helped along in other ways. And now, though the\\ntearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard, this opportunity was\\nirresistible in its call. The prayer of her dreams had been answered. To\\nbring good fortune to her family; to take care of this beautiful, wild\\nlittle sister; to leave the yellow, sordid, humdrum towns for the great,\\nrolling, boundless open; to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day\\nto be her own; to have fulfilled a deep, instinctive, and undeveloped\\nlove of horses, cattle, sheep, of desert and mountain, of trees and\\nbrooks and wild flowers  all this was the sum of her most passionate\\nlongings, now in some marvelous, fairylike way to come true.\",\n",
       " 'A check to her happy anticipations, a blank, sickening dash of cold\\nwater upon her warm and intimate dreams, had been the discovery\\nthat Harve Riggs was on the train. His presence could mean only one\\nthing  that he had followed her. Riggs had been the worst of many\\nsore trials back there in St. Joseph. He had possessed some claim or\\ninfluence upon her mother, who favored his offer of marriage to Helen;\\nhe was neither attractive, nor good, nor industrious, nor anything that\\ninterested her; he was the boastful, strutting adventurer, not genuinely\\nWestern, and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety. Helen had\\nsuspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his,\\nand also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be bad  as\\nWestern men were bad. But on the train, in the station at La Junta, one\\nglimpse of him, manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of\\nher sight, warned Helen that she now might have a problem on her hands.',\n",
       " \"The recognition sobered her. All was not to be a road of roses to this\\nnew home in the West. Riggs would follow her, if he could not accompany\\nher, and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything. Helen felt the\\nstartling realization of being cast upon her own resources, and then\\na numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness. But these\\nfeelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her\\ntemper. Opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to\\nit. She would not have been Al Auchincloss's niece if she had faltered.\\nAnd, when temper was succeeded by genuine anger, she could have laughed\\nto scorn this Harve Riggs and his schemes, whatever they were. Once\\nand for all she dismissed fear of him. When she left St. Joseph she had\\nfaced the West with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of\\nthat West. Homes had to be made out there in that far country, so Uncle\\nAl had written, and women were needed to make homes. She meant to be one\\nof these women and to make of her sister another. And with the thought\\nthat she would know definitely what to say to Riggs when he approached\\nher, sooner or later, Helen dismissed him from mind.\",\n",
       " \"While the train was in motion, enabling Helen to watch the ever changing\\nscenery, and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping Bo well in\\nhand at stations, she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests\\nand the red, rocky gullies and the dim, bold mountains. She saw the sun\\nset over distant ranges of New Mexico  a golden blaze of glory, as new\\nto her as the strange fancies born in her, thrilling and fleeting by.\\nBo's raptures were not silent, and the instant the sun sank and the\\ncolor faded she just as rapturously importuned Helen to get out the huge\\nbasket of food they had brought from home.\",\n",
       " 'They had two seats, facing each other, at the end of the coach, and\\npiled there, with the basket on top, was luggage that constituted all\\nthe girls owned in the world. Indeed, it was very much more than they\\nhad ever owned before, because their mother, in her care for them and\\ndesire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle, had spent\\nmoney and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes.',\n",
       " 'The girls sat together, with the heavy basket on their knees, and ate\\nwhile they gazed out at the cool, dark ridges. The train clattered\\nslowly on, apparently over a road that was all curves. And it was\\nsupper time for everybody in that crowded coach. If Helen had not been\\nso absorbed by the great, wild mountain land she would have had more\\ninterest in the passengers. As it was she saw them, and was amused\\nand thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car, all\\nmiddle class people, poor and hopeful, traveling out there to the New\\nWest to find homes. It was splendid and beautiful, this fact, yet it\\ninspired a brief and inexplicable sadness. From the train window, that\\nworld of forest and crag, with its long bare reaches between, seemed so\\nlonely, so wild, so unlivable. How endless the distance! For hours and\\nmiles upon miles no house, no hut, no Indian tepee! It was amazing, the\\nlength and breadth of this beautiful land. And Helen, who loved brooks\\nand running streams, saw no water at all.',\n",
       " 'Then darkness settled down over the slow moving panorama; a cool night\\nwind blew in at the window; white stars began to blink out of the blue.\\nThe sisters, with hands clasped and heads nestled together, went to\\nsleep under a heavy cloak.',\n",
       " '“Look! Look!” cried Bo, in thrilling voice. “Cowboys! Oh, Nell, look!”',\n",
       " 'Helen, laughing, looked first at her sister, and thought how most of all\\nshe was good to look at. Bo was little, instinct with pulsating life,\\nand she had chestnut hair and dark blue eyes. These eyes were flashing,\\nroguish, and they drew like magnets.',\n",
       " \"Outside on the rude station platform were railroad men, Mexicans, and\\na group of lounging cowboys. Long, lean, bow legged fellows they were,\\nwith young, frank faces and intent eyes. One of them seemed particularly\\nattractive with his superb build, his red bronze face and bright red\\nscarf, his swinging gun, and the huge, long, curved spurs. Evidently\\nhe caught Bo's admiring gaze, for, with a word to his companions, he\\nsauntered toward the window where the girls sat. His gait was singular,\\nalmost awkward, as if he was not accustomed to walking. The long spurs\\njingled musically. He removed his sombrero and stood at ease, frank,\\ncool, smiling. Helen liked him on sight, and, looking to see what effect\\nhe had upon Bo, she found that young lady staring, frightened stiff.\",\n",
       " \"“Good mawnin',” drawled the cowboy, with slow, good humored smile. “Now\\nwhere might you all be travelin'?”\",\n",
       " 'The sound of his voice, the clean cut and droll geniality; seemed new\\nand delightful to Helen.',\n",
       " '“We go to Magdalena  then take stage for the White Mountains,” replied\\nHelen.',\n",
       " \"The cowboy's still, intent eyes showed surprise.\",\n",

       " \"His lazy smile was infectious and his meaning was as clear as crystal\\nwater. The gaze he bent upon Bo somehow pleased Helen.

       " 'Helen had a mischievous trait, which, subdue it as she would,\\noccasionally cropped out; and Bo, who once in her wilful life had been\\nrendered speechless, offered such a temptation.',\n",
       " '“Maybe my little sister will put in a good word for you  to Uncle Al,”\\n said Helen. Just then the train jerked, and started slowly. The cowboy\\ntook two long strides beside the car, his heated boyish face almost on a\\nlevel with the window, his eyes, now shy and a little wistful, yet bold,\\ntoo, fixed upon Bo.',\n",
       " '“Good by  Sweetheart!” he called.',\n",
       " 'He halted  was lost to view.',\n",

       " \"One of the trainmen directed the girls' attention to a green, sloping\\nmountain rising to a bold, blunt bluff of bare rock; and, calling\\nit Starvation Peak, he told a story of how Indians had once driven\\nSpaniards up there and starved them. Bo was intensely interested, and\\nthereafter she watched more keenly than ever, and always had a question\\nfor a passing trainman. The adobe houses of the Mexicans pleased her,\\nand, then the train got out into Indian country, where pueblos appeared\\nnear the track and Indians with their bright colors and shaggy wild\\nmustangs  then she was enraptured.\",\n",
       " '“But these Indians are peaceful!” she exclaimed once, regretfully.',\n",
       " \"“Gracious, child! You don't want to see hostile Indians, do you?”\\n queried Helen.\",\n",

       " 'Only a few passengers were in the car and they were Mexicans at the\\nforward end. This branch train consisted of one passenger coach, with a\\nbaggage car, attached to a string of freight cars. Helen told herself,\\nsomewhat grimly, that soon she would know surely whether or not her\\nsuspicions of Harve Riggs had warrant. If he was going on to Magdalena\\non that day he must go in this coach. Presently Bo, who was not obeying\\nadmonitions, drew her head out of the window.

       " 'Then Helen saw Harve Riggs enter, burdened with much luggage. He was a\\nman of about medium height, of dark, flashy appearance, cultivating long\\nblack mustache and hair. His apparel was striking, as it consisted of\\nblack frock coat, black trousers stuffed in high, fancy topped boots,\\nan embroidered vest, and flowing tie, and a black sombrero. His belt and\\ngun were prominent. It was significant that he excited comment among the\\nother passengers.',\n",
       " 'When he had deposited his pieces of baggage he seemed to square himself,\\nand, turning abruptly, approached the seat occupied by the girls. When\\nhe reached it he sat down upon the arm of the one opposite, took off\\nhis sombrero, and deliberately looked at Helen.

She would rise\\nout of that. But just now this flashing eyed little sister seemed a\\nprotector. Bo would readily adapt herself to the West, Helen thought,\\nbecause she was so young, primitive, elemental.',\n",

Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican children that\\ndarted into adobe huts as the train clattered by, and she exclaimed her\\npleasure in the Indians, and the mustangs, and particularly in a group\\nof cowboys riding into town on spirited horses. Helen saw all Bo pointed\\nout, but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung\\nlongest, and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something\\nfrom her. She had never before experienced any feeling like that; she\\nhad never seen a tenth so far. And the sight awoke something strange\\nin her. The sun was burning hot, as she could tell when she put a hand\\noutside the window, and a strong wind blew sheets of dry dust at the\\ntrain. She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest\\nwere the sun and the dust and the wind. And her realization made her\\nlove them. It was there; the open, the wild, the beautiful, the lonely\\nland; and she felt the poignant call of blood in her  to seek, to\\nstrive, to find, to live. One look down that yellow valley, endless\\nbetween its dark iron ramparts, had given her understanding of her\\nuncle. She must be like him in spirit, as it was claimed she resembled\\nhim otherwise.',\n",
       " 'At length Bo grew tired of watching scenery that contained no life, and,\\nwith her bright head on the faded cloak, she went to sleep. But Helen\\nkept steady, farseeing gaze out upon that land of rock and plain; and\\nduring the long hours, as she watched through clouds of dust and veils\\nof heat, some strong and doubtful and restless sentiment seemed to\\nchange and then to fix. It was her physical acceptance  her eyes and her\\nsenses taking the West as she had already taken it in spirit.',\n",
       " 'A woman should love her home wherever fate placed her, Helen believed,\\nand not so much from duty as from delight and romance and living. How\\ncould life ever be tedious or monotonous out here in this tremendous\\nvastness of bare earth and open sky, where the need to achieve made\\nthinking and pondering superficial?',\n",
       " 'She noted, too, that the whites and yellows of earth and rock had\\nbegun to shade to red  and this she knew meant an approach to\\nArizona. Arizona, the wild, the lonely, the red desert, the green\\nplateau  Arizona with its thundering rivers, its unknown spaces, its\\npasture lands and timber lands, its wild horses, cowboys, outlaws,\\nwolves and lions and savages! As to a boy, that name stirred and\\nthrilled and sang to her of nameless, sweet, intangible things,\\nmysterious and all of adventure.

       " \"Time passed, while Helen watched and learned and dreamed. The train\\nstopped, at long intervals, at wayside stations where there seemed\\nnothing but adobe sheds and lazy Mexicans, and dust and heat.

And she was full of\\nconjectures as to who would meet them, what would happen. So Helen was\\ndrawn back to sober realities, in which there was considerable zest.\\nAssuredly she did not know what was going to happen. Twice Riggs passed\\nup and down the aisle, his dark face and light eyes and sardonic smile\\ndeliberately forced upon her sight. But again Helen fought a growing\\ndread with contemptuous scorn. This fellow was not half a man. It was\\nnot conceivable what he could do, except annoy her, until she arrived\\nat Pine.

A few nights ago I happened to be caught out in a storm\\nan' I took to an old log cabin. Soon as I got there I heard horses.\\nI hid up in the loft. Some men rode up an' come in. It was dark. They\\ncouldn't see me. An' they talked. It turned out they were Snake Anson\\nan' his gang of sheep thieves. They expected to meet Beasley there.\\nPretty soon he came. He told Anson how old Al, your uncle, was on his\\nlast legs  how he had sent for you to have his property when he died.\\nBeasley swore he had claims on Al. An' he made a deal with Anson to get\\nyou out of the way. He named the day you were to reach Magdalena. With\\nAl dead an' you not there, Beasley could get the property. An' then he\\nwouldn't care if you did come to claim it. It 'd be too late... Well,\\nthey rode away that night. An' next day I rustled down to Pine. They're\\nall my friends at Pine, except old Al. But they think I'm queer. I\\ndidn't want to confide in many people. Beasley is strong in Pine, an'\\nfor that matter I suspect Snake Anson has other friends there besides\\nBeasley. So I went to see your uncle. He never had any use for me\\nbecause he thought I was lazy like an Indian. Old Al hates lazy men.\\nThen we fell out  or he fell out  because he believed a tame lion of\\nmine had killed some of his sheep. An' now I reckon that Tom might have\\ndone it. I tried to lead up to this deal of Beasley's about you, but\\nold Al wouldn't listen. He's cross  very cross. An' when I tried to tell\\nhim, why, he went right out of his head. Sent me off the ranch. Now I\\nreckon you begin to see what a pickle I was in. Finally I went to four\\nfriends I could trust. They're Mormon boys  brothers. That's Joe out\\non top, with the driver. I told them all about Beasley's deal an' asked\\nthem to help me. So we planned to beat Anson an' his gang to Magdalena.\\nIt happens that Beasley is as strong in Magdalena as he is in Pine.\\nAn' we had to go careful. But the boys had a couple of friends\\nhere  Mormons, too, who agreed to help us. They had this old stage...\\nAn' here you are.” Dale spread out his big hands and looked gravely at\\nHelen and then at Bo.\",\n",
       " \"“You're perfectly splendid!” cried Bo, ringingly. She was white; her\\nfingers were clenched; her eyes blazed.\",\n",
       " \"“So far, then,” resumed Dale, with a heavy breath of relief. “No wonder\\nyou're upset. I've a blunt way of talkin'... Now we've thirty miles to\\nride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off. To day sometime the\\nrest of the boys  Roy, John, an' Hal  were to leave Show Down, which's\\na town farther on from Snowdrop. They have my horses an' packs besides\\ntheir own. Somewhere on the road we'll meet them  to night, maybe  or\\ntomorrow. I hope not to night, because that 'd mean Anson's gang was\\nridin' in to Magdalena.”\",\n",

       " \"“Mr.  Mr. Dale,” faltered Helen, with her tears falling, “don't think me\\na coward  or  or ungrateful. I'm neither. It's only I'm so  so shocked.\\nAfter all we hoped and expected  this  this  is such a  a terrible\\nsurprise.”\",\n",
       " \"“Never mind, Nell dear. Let's take what comes,” murmured Bo.\",\n",

       " 'His words, meant to be kind and reassuring, were almost as sinister to\\nHelen as the menace to her own life.

This cheerful young\\nman spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf. The thought it roused\\nwas tragic  for bloodshed was insupportable to her  and then the thrills\\nwhich followed were so new, strange, bold, and tingling that they were\\nrevolting. Helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths, of instincts at\\nwhich she was amazed and ashamed.',\n",
       " \"“Joe, hand down that basket of grub  the small one with the canteen,”\\n said Dale, reaching out a long arm. Presently he placed a cloth covered\\nbasket inside the stage. “Girls, eat all you want an' then some.”\",\n",

       " \"“You'll need it all before we get to Pine... Now, I'll ride up on top\\nwith the boys an' eat my supper. It'll be dark, presently, an' we'll\\nstop often to listen. But don't be scared.”\",\n",
       " \"With that he took his rifle and, closing the door, clambered up to the\\ndriver's seat. Then the stage lurched again and began to roll along.\",\n",

       " '“I heard some animal yelp,” said Bo, suddenly, and she listened with\\nhead poised.',\n",
       " 'But Helen heard nothing save the steady clip clop of hoofs, the clink of\\nchains, the creak and rattle of the old stage, and occasionally the low\\nvoices of the men above.',\n",

The pines were big,\\nbrown barked, seamed, and knotted, with no typical conformation except\\na majesty and beauty. They grew far apart. Few small pines and little\\nunderbrush flourished beneath them. The floor of this forest appeared\\nremarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and\\nwide brown areas of pine needles. These manifestly were what Roy\\nhad meant by pine mats. Here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or\\nrotting. Helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and\\nthe strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all, and when\\nthey did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log. Likewise\\nshe became aware of a springy nature of the ground. And then she saw\\nthat the pine mats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the\\nhorses, and after they had passed sprang back to place again, leaving no\\ntrack. Helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind. Indeed,\\nit would take a sharp eye to follow Dale through that forest. This\\nknowledge was infinitely comforting to Helen, and for the first time\\nsince the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind\\nand heart. It left her free for some of the appreciation she might have\\nhad in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances.',\n",
       " \"Bo, however, seemed too young, too wild, too intense to mind what the\\ncircumstances were. She responded to reality. Helen began to suspect\\nthat the girl would welcome any adventure, and Helen knew surely now\\nthat Bo was a true Auchincloss. For three long days Helen had felt a\\nconstraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar; for the last\\nhours it had been submerged under dread. But it must be, she concluded,\\nblood like her sister's, pounding at her veins to be set free to race\\nand to burn.\",\n",
       " 'Bo loved action. She had an eye for beauty, but she was not\\ncontemplative. She was now helping Dale drive the horses and hold them\\nin rather close formation. She rode well, and as yet showed no symptoms\\nof fatigue or pain. Helen began to be aware of both, but not enough yet\\nto limit her interest.',\n",
       " \"A wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her. Of all living\\ncreatures in nature Helen liked birds best, and she knew many and could\\nimitate the songs of a few. But here under the stately pines there were\\nno birds. Squirrels, however, began to be seen here and there, and in\\nthe course of an hour's travel became abundant. The only one with which\\nshe was familiar was the chipmunk. All the others, from the slim bright\\nblacks to the striped russets and the white tailed grays, were totally\\nnew to her. They appeared tame and curious. The reds barked and scolded\\nat the passing cavalcade; the blacks glided to some safe branch, there\\nto watch; the grays paid no especial heed to this invasion of their\\ndomain.\",\n",
       " 'Once Dale, halting his horse, pointed with long arm, and Helen,\\nfollowing the direction, descried several gray deer standing in a glade,\\nmotionless, with long ears up. They made a wild and beautiful picture.\\nSuddenly they bounded away with remarkable springy strides.',\n",
       " 'The forest on the whole held to the level, open character, but there\\nwere swales and stream beds breaking up its regular conformity. Toward\\nnoon, however, it gradually changed, a fact that Helen believed she\\nmight have observed sooner had she been more keen. The general lay of\\nthe land began to ascend, and the trees to grow denser.',\n",
       " 'She made another discovery. Ever since she had entered the forest she\\nhad become aware of a fullness in her head and a something affecting\\nher nostrils. She imagined, with regret, that she had taken cold. But\\npresently her head cleared somewhat and she realized that the thick pine\\nodor of the forest had clogged her nostrils as if with a sweet pitch.\\nThe smell was overpowering and disagreeable because of its strength.\\nAlso her throat and lungs seemed to burn.',\n",
       " 'When she began to lose interest in the forest and her surroundings\\nit was because of aches and pains which would no longer be denied\\nrecognition. Thereafter she was not permitted to forget them and they\\ngrew worse. One, especially, was a pain beyond all her experience.\\nIt lay in the muscles of her side, above her hip, and it grew to be a\\ntreacherous thing, for it was not persistent. It came and went. After it\\ndid come, with a terrible flash, it could be borne by shifting or easing\\nthe body. But it gave no warning. When she expected it she was mistaken;\\nwhen she dared to breathe again, then, with piercing swiftness,\\nit returned like a blade in her side. This, then, was one of the\\nriding pains that made a victim of a tenderfoot on a long ride. It\\nwas almost too much to be borne. The beauty of the forest, the living\\ncreatures to be seen scurrying away, the time, distance  everything\\nfaded before that stablike pain. To her infinite relief she found that\\nit was the trot that caused this torture. When Ranger walked she did not\\nhave to suffer it. Therefore she held him to a walk as long as she dared\\nor until Dale and Bo were almost out of sight; then she loped him ahead\\nuntil he had caught up.',\n",
       " 'So the hours passed, the sun got around low, sending golden shafts\\nunder the trees, and the forest gradually changed to a brighter, but a\\nthicker, color. This slowly darkened. Sunset was not far away.',\n",
       " 'She heard the horses splashing in water, and soon she rode up to see the\\ntiny streams of crystal water running swiftly over beds of green moss.\\nShe crossed a number of these and followed along the last one into a\\nmore open place in the forest where the pines were huge, towering,\\nand far apart. A low, gray bluff of stone rose to the right, perhaps\\none third as high as the trees. From somewhere came the rushing sound of\\nrunning water.',\n",
       " '“Big Spring,” announced Dale. “We camp here. You girls have done well.”',\n",

       " 'Bo essayed to dismount, and finally fell off, and when she did get to\\nthe ground her legs appeared to refuse their natural function, and she\\nfell flat. Dale helped her up.',\n",
       " \"“What's wrong with me, anyhow?” she demanded, in great amaze.\",\n",
       " '“Just stiff, I reckon,” replied Dale, as he led her a few awkward steps.',\n",
       " '“Bo, have you any hurts?” queried Helen, who still sat her horse, loath\\nto try dismounting, yet wanting to beyond all words.',\n",

       " '“Drink slow,” called out Dale.',\n",
       " 'Big Spring had its source somewhere deep under the gray, weathered\\nbluff, from which came a hollow subterranean gurgle and roar of water.\\nIts fountainhead must have been a great well rushing up through the cold\\nstone.',\n",
       " \"Helen and Bo lay flat on a mossy bank, seeing their faces as they bent\\nover, and they sipped a mouthful, by Dale's advice, and because they\\nwere so hot and parched and burning they wanted to tarry a moment with a\\nprecious opportunity.\",\n",
       " 'The water was so cold that it sent a shock over Helen, made her teeth\\nache, and a singular, revivifying current steal all through her,\\nwonderful in its cool absorption of that dry heat of flesh, irresistible\\nin its appeal to thirst. Helen raised her head to look at this water. It\\nwas colorless as she had found it tasteless.',\n",
       " '“Nell  drink!” panted Bo. “Think of our  old spring  in the\\norchard  full of pollywogs!”',\n",
       " \"And then Helen drank thirstily, with closed eyes, while a memory of home\\nstirred from Bo's gift of poignant speech.\",\n",
       " 'The first camp duty Dale performed was to throw a pack off one of the\\nhorses, and, opening it, he took out tarpaulin and blankets, which he\\narranged on the ground under a pine tree.',\n",
       " '“You girls rest,” he said, briefly.',\n",

       " \"“It does,” replied Bo, as slowly she sat down upon the blankets,\\nstretched out with a long sigh, and laid her head on a saddle. “Nell,\\ndidn't he say not to call him Mister?”\",\n",
       " 'Helen lay down beside Bo, and then for once in her life she experienced\\nthe sweetness of rest.',\n",
       " '“Well, sister, what do you intend to call him?” queried Helen,\\ncuriously.',\n",
       " '“Milt, of course,” replied Bo.',\n",

       " '“I suppose, then, when your Las Vegas cowboy comes along you will call\\nhim what he called you.”',\n",
       " 'Bo blushed, which was a rather unusual thing for her.',\n",
       " \"“I will if I like,” she retorted. “Nell, ever since I could remember\\nyou've raved about the West. Now you're OUT West, right in it good and\\ndeep. So wake up!”\",\n",
       " \"That was Bo's blunt and characteristic way of advising the elimination\\nof Helen's superficialities. It sank deep. Helen had no retort. Her\\nambition, as far as the West was concerned, had most assuredly not been\\nfor such a wild, unheard of jaunt as this. But possibly the West  a\\nliving from day to day  was one succession of adventures, trials,\\ntests, troubles, and achievements. To make a place for others to live\\ncomfortably some day! That might be Bo's meaning, embodied in her\\nforceful hint. But Helen was too tired to think it out then. She found\\nit interesting and vaguely pleasant to watch Dale.\",\n",
       " 'He hobbled the horses and turned them loose. Then with ax in hand he\\napproached a short, dead tree, standing among a few white barked\\naspens. Dale appeared to advantage swinging the ax. With his coat off,\\ndisplaying his wide shoulders, straight back, and long, powerful arms,\\nhe looked a young giant. He was lithe and supple, brawny but not bulky.\\nThe ax rang on the hard wood, reverberating through the forest. A few\\nstrokes sufficed to bring down the stub. Then he split it up. Helen was\\ncurious to see how he kindled a fire. First he ripped splinters out of\\nthe heart of the log, and laid them with coarser pieces on the ground.\\nThen from a saddlebag which hung on a near by branch he took flint and\\nsteel and a piece of what Helen supposed was rag or buckskin, upon\\nwhich powder had been rubbed. At any rate, the first strike of the steel\\nbrought sparks, a blaze, and burning splinters. Instantly the flame\\nleaped a foot high. He put on larger pieces of wood crosswise, and the\\nfire roared.',\n",
       " 'That done, he stood erect, and, facing the north, he listened. Helen\\nremembered now that she had seen him do the same thing twice before\\nsince the arrival at Big Spring. It was Roy for whom he was listening\\nand watching. The sun had set and across the open space the tips of the\\npines were losing their brightness.',\n",
       " 'The camp utensils, which the hunter emptied out of a sack, gave forth a\\njangle of iron and tin. Next he unrolled a large pack, the contents\\nof which appeared to be numerous sacks of all sizes. These evidently\\ncontained food supplies. The bucket looked as if a horse had rolled over\\nit, pack and all. Dale filled it at the spring. Upon returning to the\\ncamp fire he poured water into a washbasin, and, getting down to his\\nknees, proceeded to wash his hands thoroughly. The act seemed a habit,\\nfor Helen saw that while he was doing it he gazed off into the woods\\nand listened. Then he dried his hands over the fire, and, turning to the\\nspread out pack, he began preparations for the meal.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly Helen thought of the man and all that his actions implied.\\nAt Magdalena, on the stage ride, and last night, she had trusted\\nthis stranger, a hunter of the White Mountains, who appeared ready to\\nbefriend her. And she had felt an exceeding gratitude. Still, she had\\nlooked at him impersonally. But it began to dawn upon her that chance\\nhad thrown her in the company of a remarkable man. That impression\\nbaffled her. It did not spring from the fact that he was brave and kind\\nto help a young woman in peril, or that he appeared deft and quick at\\ncamp fire chores. Most Western men were brave, her uncle had told her,\\nand many were roughly kind, and all of them could cook. This hunter was\\nphysically a wonderful specimen of manhood, with something leonine about\\nhis stature. But that did not give rise to her impression. Helen\\nhad been a school teacher and used to boys, and she sensed a boyish\\nsimplicity or vigor or freshness in this hunter. She believed, however,\\nthat it was a mental and spiritual force in Dale which had drawn her to\\nthink of it.',\n",
       " \"“Nell, I've spoken to you three times,” protested Bo, petulantly. “What\\n're you mooning over?”\",\n",
       " \"“I'm pretty tired  and far away, Bo,” replied Helen. “What did you say?”\",\n",
       " '“I said I had an e normous appetite.”',\n",
       " \"“Really. That's not remarkable for you. I'm too tired to eat. And afraid\\nto shut my eyes. They'd never come open. When did we sleep last, Bo?”\",\n",

       " \"“Four nights! Oh, we've slept some.”\",\n",
       " \"“I'll bet I make mine up in this woods. Do you suppose we'll sleep right\\nhere  under this tree  with no covering?”\",\n",
       " '“It looks so,” replied Helen, dubiously.',\n",
       " \"“How perfectly lovely!” exclaimed Bo, in delight. “We'll see the stars\\nthrough the pines.”\",\n",
       " \"“Seems to be clouding over. Wouldn't it be awful if we had a storm?”\",\n",
       " \"“Why, I don't know,” answered Bo, thoughtfully. “It must storm out\\nWest.”\",\n",
       " 'Again Helen felt a quality of inevitableness in Bo. It was something\\nthat had appeared only practical in the humdrum home life in St. Joseph.\\nAll of a sudden Helen received a flash of wondering thought  a thrilling\\nconsciousness that she and Bo had begun to develop in a new and wild\\nenvironment. How strange, and fearful, perhaps, to watch that growth!\\nBo, being younger, more impressionable, with elemental rather than\\nintellectual instincts, would grow stronger more swiftly. Helen wondered\\nif she could yield to her own leaning to the primitive. But how could\\nanyone with a thoughtful and grasping mind yield that way? It was the\\nsavage who did not think.',\n",
       " 'Helen saw Dale stand erect once more and gaze into the forest.',\n",

       " '“What kind?” asked Bo.',\n",
       " \"“Wild turkey or deer. Maybe both, if you like. But it's well to take\\nwild meat slow. An' turkey  that 'll melt in your mouth.”\",\n",
       " \"“Uummm!” murmured Bo, greedily. “I've heard of wild turkey.”\",\n",
       " \"When they had finished Dale ate his meal, listening to the talk of the\\ngirls, and occasionally replying briefly to some query of Bo's. It was\\ntwilight when he began to wash the pots and pans, and almost dark by the\\ntime his duties appeared ended. Then he replenished the campfire and\\nsat down on a log to gaze into the fire. The girls leaned comfortably\\npropped against the saddles.\",\n",

       " '“Listen.”',\n",
       " \"The girls grew tense and still. Helen could not hear a sound, unless it\\nwas a low thud of hoof out in the gloom. The forest seemed sleeping. She\\nknew from Bo's eyes, wide and shining in the camp fire light, that she,\\ntoo, had failed to catch whatever it was Dale meant.\",\n",
       " \"“Bunch of coyotes comin',” he explained.\",\n",
       " 'Suddenly the quietness split to a chorus of snappy, high strung, strange\\nbarks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or\\ninquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at the\\nedge of the circle of light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded\\nthe camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a\\nrestless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after\\nthe chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes\\nwent away.',\n",
       " \"Silence again settled down. If it had not been for the anxiety always\\npresent in Helen's mind she would have thought this silence sweet and\\nunfamiliarly beautiful.\",\n",

       " 'Again the girls strained their ears. That was not necessary, for\\npresently, clear and cold out of the silence, pealed a mournful howl,\\nlong drawn, strange and full and wild.',\n",
       " \"“Oh! What's that?” whispered Bo.\",\n",
       " \"“That's a big gray wolf  a timber wolf, or lofer, as he's sometimes\\ncalled,” replied Dale. “He's high on some rocky ridge back there. He\\nscents us, an' he doesn't like it... There he goes again. Listen! Ah,\\nhe's hungry.”\",\n",
       " 'While Helen listened to this exceedingly wild cry  so wild that it made\\nher flesh creep and the most indescribable sensations of loneliness come\\nover her  she kept her glance upon Dale.',\n",

       " '“Why, then, can you love him?” repeated Helen.',\n",
       " \"“Come to think of it, I reckon it's because of lots of reasons,”\\n returned Dale. “He kills clean. He eats no carrion. He's no coward. He\\nfights. He dies game... An' he likes to be alone.”\",\n",
       " '“Kills clean. What do you mean by that?”',\n",
       " \"“A cougar, now, he mangles a deer. An' a silvertip, when killin' a\\ncow or colt, he makes a mess of it. But a wolf kills clean, with sharp\\nsnaps.”\",\n",
       " '“What are a cougar and a silvertip?”',\n",
       " \"“Cougar means mountain lion or panther, an' a silvertip is a grizzly\\nbear.”\",\n",
       " \"“Oh, they're all cruel!” exclaimed Helen, shrinking.\",\n",

       " \"“Sometimes two or more wolves will run a deer, an' while one of them\\nrests the other will drive the deer around to his pardner, who'll, take\\nup the chase.

Cruel it is, but nature,\\nan' no worse than snow an' ice that starve deer, or a fox that kills\\nturkey chicks breakin' out of the egg, or ravens that pick the eyes out\\nof new born lambs an' wait till they die. An' for that matter, men are\\ncrueler than beasts of prey, for men add to nature, an' have more than\\ninstincts.”\",\n",
       " \"Helen was silenced, as well as shocked. She had not only learned a new\\nand striking viewpoint in natural history, but a clear intimation to the\\nreason why she had vaguely imagined or divined a remarkable character in\\nthis man. A hunter was one who killed animals for their fur, for their\\nmeat or horns, or for some lust for blood  that was Helen's definition\\nof a hunter, and she believed it was held by the majority of people\\nliving in settled states. But the majority might be wrong. A hunter\\nmight be vastly different, and vastly more than a tracker and slayer\\nof game. The mountain world of forest was a mystery to almost all men.\\nPerhaps Dale knew its secrets, its life, its terror, its beauty, its\\nsadness, and its joy; and if so, how full, how wonderful must be his\\nmind! He spoke of men as no better than wolves. Could a lonely life\\nin the wilderness teach a man that? Bitterness, envy, jealousy, spite,\\ngreed, and hate  these had no place in this hunter's heart. It was not\\nHelen's shrewdness, but a woman's intuition, which divined that.\",\n",
       " '“Are you expecting Roy still?” inquired Helen.',\n",
       " \"“No, it ain't likely he'll turn up to night,” replied Dale, and then he\\nstrode over to put a hand on the pine tree that soared above where the\\ngirls lay. His action, and the way he looked up at the tree top and then\\nat adjacent trees, held more of that significance which so interested\\nHelen.\",\n",
       " \"“I reckon he's stood there some five hundred years an' will stand\\nthrough to night,” muttered Dale.\",\n",

By the light of the\\ncamp fire she saw Dale's face, just as usual, still, darkly serene,\\nexpressing no thought. He was kind, but he was not thinking of these\\nsisters as girls, alone with him in a pitch black forest, helpless and\\ndefenseless. He did not seem to be thinking at all. But Helen had never\\nbefore in her life been so keenly susceptible to experience.\",\n",
       " \"“I'll be close by an' keep the fire goin' all night,” he said.\",\n",
       " 'She heard him stride off into the darkness.

       " \"Helen listened again for the roar of wind. It seemed to come on a breath\\nof air that fanned her cheek and softly blew Bo's curls, and it was\\nstronger.

       " 'A few drops of cold rain fell upon her face, thrilling her with the\\nproof that no roof stood between her and the elements.

The roar that had seemed distant was now\\nback in the forest, coming swiftly, increasing in volume. Like a\\nstream in flood it bore down. Helen grew amazed, startled. How rushing,\\noncoming, and heavy this storm wind! She likened its approach to the\\ntread of an army. Then the roar filled the forest, yet it was back there\\nbehind her. Not a pine needle quivered in the light of the camp fire.\\nBut the air seemed to be oppressed with a terrible charge. The roar\\naugmented till it was no longer a roar, but an on sweeping crash, like\\nan ocean torrent engulfing the earth. Bo awoke to cling to Helen\\nwith fright. The deafening storm blast was upon them. Helen felt the\\nsaddle pillow move under her head. The giant pine had trembled to its\\nvery roots. That mighty fury of wind was all aloft, in the tree tops.\\nAnd for a long moment it bowed the forest under its tremendous power.\\nThen the deafening crash passed to roar, and that swept on and on,\\nlessening in volume, deepening in low detonation, at last to die in the\\ndistance.',\n",
       " 'No sooner had it died than back to the north another low roar rose and\\nceased and rose again. Helen lay there, whispering to Bo, and heard\\nagain the great wave of wind come and crash and cease. That was the way\\nof this storm wind of the mountain forest.',\n",
       " \"A soft patter of rain on the tarpaulin warned Helen to remember Dale's\\ndirections, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike\\nover the saddle.

Ranger\\nwould not go down slowly and the shake up she received was unpleasant.\\nMoreover, the spirited black horse insisted on jumping the ditches and\\nwashes. He sailed over them like a bird. Helen could not acquire the\\nknack of sitting the saddle properly, and so, not only was her person\\nbruised on these occasions, but her feelings were hurt. Helen had\\nnever before been conscious of vanity. Still, she had never rejoiced\\nin looking at a disadvantage, and her exhibitions here must have been\\nfrightful. Bo always would forge to the front, and she seldom looked\\nback, for which Helen was grateful.\",\n",
       " 'Before long they struck into a broad, muddy belt, full of innumerable\\nsmall hoof tracks. This, then, was the sheep trail Roy had advised\\nfollowing. They rode on it for three or four miles, and at length,\\ncoming to a gray green valley, they saw a huge flock of sheep. Soon the\\nair was full of bleats and baas as well as the odor of sheep, and a\\nlow, soft roar of pattering hoofs. The flock held a compact formation,\\ncovering several acres, and grazed along rapidly. There were three\\nherders on horses and several pack burros. Dale engaged one of the\\nMexicans in conversation, and passed something to him, then pointed\\nnorthward and down along the trail. The Mexican grinned from ear to ear,\\nand Helen caught the quick “SI, SENOR! GRACIAS, SENOR!” It was a pretty\\nsight, that flock of sheep, as it rolled along like a rounded woolly\\nstream of grays and browns and here and there a black. They were keeping\\nto a trail over the flats. Dale headed into this trail and, if anything,\\ntrotted a little faster.',\n",
       " 'Presently the clouds lifted and broke, showing blue sky and one streak\\nof sunshine. But the augury was without warrant. The wind increased. A\\nhuge black pall bore down from the mountains and it brought rain that\\ncould be seen falling in sheets from above and approaching like a\\nswiftly moving wall. Soon it enveloped the fugitives.',\n",
       " \"With head bowed, Helen rode along for what seemed ages in a cold, gray\\nrain that blew almost on a level. Finally the heavy downpour passed,\\nleaving a fine mist. The clouds scurried low and dark, hiding the\\nmountains altogether and making the gray, wet plain a dreary sight.\\nHelen's feet and knees were as wet as if she had waded in water. And\\nthey were cold. Her gloves, too, had not been intended for rain, and\\nthey were wet through. The cold bit at her fingers so that she had to\\nbeat her hands together. Ranger misunderstood this to mean that he was\\nto trot faster, which event was worse for Helen than freezing.\",\n",
       " \"She saw another black, scudding mass of clouds bearing down with its\\ntrailing sheets of rain, and this one appeared streaked with white.\\nSnow! The wind was now piercingly cold. Helen's body kept warm, but\\nher extremities and ears began to suffer exceedingly. She gazed ahead\\ngrimly. There was no help; she had to go on. Dale and Roy were hunched\\ndown in their saddles, probably wet through, for they wore no rain proof\\ncoats. Bo kept close behind them, and plain it was that she felt the\\ncold.\",\n",
       " \"This second storm was not so bad as the first, because there was less\\nrain. Still, the icy keenness of the wind bit into the marrow. It lasted\\nfor an hour, during which the horses trotted on, trotted on. Again the\\ngray torrent roared away, the fine mist blew, the clouds lifted and\\nseparated, and, closing again, darkened for another onslaught. This one\\nbrought sleet. The driving pellets stung Helen's neck and cheeks, and\\nfor a while they fell so thick and so hard upon her back that she was\\nafraid she could not hold up under them. The bare places on the ground\\nshowed a sparkling coverlet of marbles of ice.\",\n",
       " \"Thus, storm after storm rolled over Helen's head. Her feet grew numb\\nand ceased to hurt. But her fingers, because of her ceaseless efforts\\nto keep up the circulation, retained the stinging pain. And now the wind\\npierced right through her. She marveled at her endurance, and there were\\nmany times that she believed she could not ride farther. Yet she kept\\non. All the winters she had ever lived had not brought such a day as\\nthis. Hard and cold, wet and windy, at an increasing elevation  that was\\nthe explanation. The air did not have sufficient oxygen for her blood.\",\n",
       " 'Still, during all those interminable hours, Helen watched where she was\\ntraveling, and if she ever returned over that trail she would recognize\\nit. The afternoon appeared far advanced when Dale and Roy led down into\\nan immense basin where a reedy lake spread over the flats. They rode\\nalong its margin, splashing up to the knees of the horses. Cranes and\\nherons flew on with lumbering motion; flocks of ducks winged swift\\nflight from one side to the other. Beyond this depression the land\\nsloped rather abruptly; outcroppings of rock circled along the edge of\\nthe highest ground, and again a dark fringe of trees appeared.',\n",
       " 'How many miles! wondered Helen. They seemed as many and as long as\\nthe hours. But at last, just as another hard rain came, the pines\\nwere reached. They proved to be widely scattered and afforded little\\nprotection from the storm.',\n",
       " 'Helen sat her saddle, a dead weight. Whenever Ranger quickened his gait\\nor crossed a ditch she held on to the pommel to keep from falling\\noff. Her mind harbored only sensations of misery, and a persistent\\nthought  why did she ever leave home for the West? Her solicitude for Bo\\nhad been forgotten. Nevertheless, any marked change in the topography\\nof the country was registered, perhaps photographed on her memory by the\\ntorturing vividness of her experience.',\n",
       " \"The forest grew more level and denser. Shadows of twilight or gloom lay\\nunder the trees. Presently Dale and Roy, disappeared, going downhill,\\nand likewise Bo. Then Helen's ears suddenly filled with a roar of rapid\\nwater. Ranger trotted faster. Soon Helen came to the edge of a great\\nvalley, black and gray, so full of obscurity that she could not see\\nacross or down into it. But she knew there was a rushing river at\\nthe bottom. The sound was deep, continuous, a heavy, murmuring roar,\\nsingularly musical. The trail was steep. Helen had not lost all feeling,\\nas she had believed and hoped. Her poor, mistreated body still responded\\nexcruciatingly to concussions, jars, wrenches, and all the other\\nhorrible movements making up a horse trot.\",\n",
       " 'For long Helen did not look up. When she did so there lay a green,\\nwillow bordered, treeless space at the bottom of the valley, through\\nwhich a brown white stream rushed with steady, ear filling roar.',\n",
       " \"Ranger trotted straight to the edge, and there, obedient to Helen's\\nclutch on the bridle, he halted. The stream was fifty feet wide, shallow\\non the near side, deep on the opposite, with fast current and big waves.\\nHelen was simply too frightened to follow.\",\n",
       " '“Let him come!” yelled Dale. “Stick on now!... Ranger!”',\n",
       " 'The big black plunged in, making the water fly. That stream was nothing\\nfor him, though it seemed impassable to Helen. She had not the strength\\nleft to lift her stirrups and the water surged over them. Ranger, in two\\nmore plunges, surmounted the bank, and then, trotting across the green\\nto where the other horses stood steaming under some pines, he gave a\\ngreat heave and halted.',\n",
       " 'Roy reached up to help her off.',\n",
       " '“Thirty miles, Miss Helen,” he said, and the way he spoke was a\\ncompliment.',\n",
       " 'He had to lift her off and help her to the tree where Bo leaned. Dale\\nhad ripped off a saddle and was spreading saddle blankets on the ground\\nunder the pine.',\n",
       " \"“Nell  you swore  you loved me!” was Bo's mournful greeting. The girl\\nwas pale, drawn, blue lipped, and she could not stand up.\",\n",
       " \"“Bo, I never did  or I'd never have brought you to this  wretch that I\\nam!” cried Helen. “Oh, what a horrible ride!”\",\n",
       " 'Rain was falling, the trees were dripping, the sky was lowering. All the\\nground was soaking wet, with pools and puddles everywhere. Helen could\\nimagine nothing but a heartless, dreary, cold prospect. Just then home\\nwas vivid and poignant in her thoughts. Indeed, so utterly miserable\\nwas she that the exquisite relief of sitting down, of a cessation of\\nmovement, of a release from that infernal perpetual trotting horse,\\nseemed only a mockery. It could not be true that the time had come for\\nrest.',\n",
       " \"Evidently this place had been a camp site for hunters or sheep herders,\\nfor there were remains of a fire. Dale lifted the burnt end of a log\\nand brought it down hard upon the ground, splitting off pieces. Several\\ntimes he did this. It was amazing to see his strength, his facility, as\\nhe split off handfuls of splinters. He collected a bundle of them, and,\\nlaying them down, he bent over them. Roy wielded the ax on another log,\\nand each stroke split off a long strip. Then a tiny column of smoke\\ndrifted up over Dale's shoulder as he leaned, bareheaded, sheltering the\\nsplinters with his hat. A blaze leaped up. Roy came with an armful of\\nstrips all white and dry, out of the inside of a log. Crosswise these\\nwere laid over the blaze, and it began to roar. Then piece by piece the\\nmen built up a frame upon which they added heavier woods, branches\\nand stumps and logs, erecting a pyramid through which flames and smoke\\nroared upward. It had not taken two minutes. Already Helen felt the\\nwarmth on her icy face. She held up her bare, numb hands.\",\n",
       " 'Both Dale and Roy were wet through to the skin, yet they did not tarry\\nbeside the fire. They relieved the horses. A lasso went up between two\\npines, and a tarpaulin over it, V shaped and pegged down at the four\\nends. The packs containing the baggage of the girls and the supplies and\\nbedding were placed under this shelter.',\n",
       " 'Helen thought this might have taken five minutes more. In this short\\nspace of time the fire had leaped and flamed until it was huge and hot.\\nRain was falling steadily all around, but over and near that roaring\\nblaze, ten feet high, no water fell. It evaporated. The ground began to\\nsteam and to dry. Helen suffered at first while the heat was driving out\\nthe cold. But presently the pain ceased.',\n",
       " '“Nell, I never knew before how good a fire could feel,” declared Bo.',\n",
       " \"And therein lay more food for Helen's reflection.\",\n",

       " 'The rain kept on falling, though it appeared to grow softer as night\\nsettled down black. The wind died away and the forest was still, except\\nfor the steady roar of the stream. A folded tarpaulin was laid between\\nthe pine and the fire, well in the light and warmth, and upon it the\\nmen set steaming pots and plates and cups, the fragrance from which was\\nstrong and inviting.',\n",

       " 'Helen realized that this ride would make up for the hideous one of\\nyesterday. So far she had been only barely conscious of sore places\\nand aching bones. These she would bear with. She loved the wild and the\\nbeautiful, both of which increased manifestly with every mile. The sun\\nwas warm, the air fragrant and cool, the sky blue as azure and so deep\\nthat she imagined that she could look far up into it.',\n",
       " 'Suddenly Roy reined in so sharply that he pulled the bay up short.',\n",
       " '“Look!” he called, sharply.',\n",
       " 'Bo screamed.',\n",
       " \"“Not thet way! Here! Aw, he's gone!”\",\n",
       " '“Nell! It was a bear! I saw it! Oh! not like circus bears at all!” cried\\nBo.',\n",
       " 'Helen had missed her opportunity.',\n",
       " \"“Reckon he was a grizzly, an' I'm jest as well pleased thet he loped\\noff,” said Roy. Altering his course somewhat, he led to an old rotten\\nlog that the bear had been digging in. “After grubs. There, see his\\ntrack. He was a whopper shore enough.”\",\n",
       " 'They rode on, out to a high point that overlooked canuon and range,\\ngorge and ridge, green and black as far as Helen could see. The ranges\\nwere bold and long, climbing to the central uplift, where a number of\\nfringed peaks raised their heads to the vast bare dome of Old Baldy.\\nFar as vision could see, to the right lay one rolling forest of pine,\\nbeautiful and serene. Somewhere down beyond must have lain the desert,\\nbut it was not in sight.',\n",
       " \"“I see turkeys 'way down there,” said Roy, backing away. “We'll go down\\nand around an' mebbe I'll get a shot.”\",\n",
       " \"“Wal, I got two,” said Roy, and he strode forward to pick up his game.\\nReturning, he tied two shiny, plump gobblers back of his saddle and\\nremounted his horse. “We'll have turkey to night, if Milt gets to camp\\nin time.”\",\n",
       " 'The ride was resumed. Helen never would have tired riding through those\\noak groves, brown and sear and yellow, with leaves and acorns falling.',\n",
       " \"“Bears have been workin' in here already,” said Roy. “I see tracks all\\nover. They eat acorns in the fall. An' mebbe we'll run into one yet.”\",\n",
       " 'The farther down he led the wilder and thicker grew the trees, so that\\ndodging branches was no light task. Ranger did not seem to care how\\nclose he passed a tree or under a limb, so that he missed them himself;\\nbut Helen thereby got some additional bruises. Particularly hard was it,\\nwhen passing a tree, to get her knee out of the way in time.',\n",
       " 'Roy halted next at what appeared a large green pond full of vegetation\\nand in places covered with a thick scum. But it had a current and an\\noutlet, proving it to be a huge, spring. Roy pointed down at a muddy\\nplace.',\n",
       " \"“Bear wallow. He heard us comin'. Look at thet little track. Cub track.\\nAn' look at these scratches on this tree, higher 'n my head. An old\\nshe bear stood up, an' scratched them.”\",\n",
       " 'Roy sat his saddle and reached up to touch fresh marks on the tree.',\n",
       " \"“Woods's full of big bears,” he said, grinning. “An' I take it\\nparticular kind of this old she rustlin' off with her cub. She bears\\nwith cubs are dangerous.”\",\n",
       " 'The next place to stir Helen to enthusiasm was the glen at the bottom\\nof this canuon. Beech trees, maples, aspens, overtopped by lofty\\npines, made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown,\\nswirling current, and leaves drifted down, and stray flecks of golden\\nsunlight lightened the gloom. Here was hard riding to and fro across the\\nbrook, between huge mossy boulders, and between aspens so close together\\nthat Helen could scarce squeeze her knees through.',\n",
       " 'Once more Roy climbed out of that canuon, over a ridge into another,\\ndown long wooded slopes and through scrub oak thickets, on and on\\ntill the sun stood straight overhead. Then he halted for a short rest,\\nunsaddled the horses to let them roll, and gave the girls some cold\\nlunch that he had packed. He strolled off with his gun, and, upon\\nreturning, resaddled and gave the word to start.',\n",
       " 'That was the last of rest and easy traveling for the girls. The forest\\nthat he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines\\nso steep of slope as to make precarious travel. Mostly he kept to the\\nbottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail. But it was necessary\\nto cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed, and this\\ncrossing was work.',\n",
       " \"The locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close\\nknit. They tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders. Ranger\\nappeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less.\\nBo's white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place. On\\nthe other hand, some of these steep slopes, were comparatively free of\\nunderbrush. Great firs and pines loomed up on all sides. The earth was\\nsoft and the hoofs sank deep. Toward the bottom of a descent Ranger\\nwould brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches. This\\nmode facilitated travel, but it frightened Helen. The climb out then on\\nthe other side had to be done on foot.\",\n",
       " \"After half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way Helen's strength was\\nspent and her breath was gone. She felt light headed. She could not get\\nenough air. Her feet felt like lead, and her riding coat was a burden.\\nA hundred times, hot and wet and throbbing, she was compelled to stop.\\nAlways she had been a splendid walker and climber. And here, to break up\\nthe long ride, she was glad to be on her feet. But she could only drag\\none foot up after the other. Then, when her nose began to bleed, she\\nrealized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble.\\nHer heart, however, did not hurt her, though she was conscious of an\\noppression on her breast.\",\n",
       " 'At last Roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest\\nverdure that it appeared impossible to cross. Nevertheless, he started\\ndown, dismounting after a little way. Helen found that leading Ranger\\ndown was worse than riding him. He came fast and he would step right\\nin her tracks. She was not quick enough to get away from him. Twice\\nhe stepped on her foot, and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and\\nthrew her flat. When he began to slide, near the bottom, Helen had to\\nrun for her life.',\n",
       " \"“Oh, Nell! Isn't  this  great?” panted Bo, from somewhere ahead.\",\n",
       " \"“Bo  your  mind's  gone,” panted Helen, in reply.\",\n",
       " 'Roy tried several places to climb out, and failed in each. Leading down\\nthe ravine for a hundred yards or more, he essayed another attempt.\\nHere there had been a slide, and in part the earth was bare. When he had\\nworked up this, he halted above, and called:',\n",
       " '“Bad place! Keep on the up side of the hosses!”',\n",
       " 'This appeared easier said than done. Helen could not watch Bo, because\\nRanger would not wait. He pulled at the bridle and snorted.',\n",
       " '“Faster you come the better,” called Roy.',\n",
       " 'Helen could not see the sense of that, but she tried. Roy and Bo had dug\\na deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide. Helen made the mistake\\nof starting to follow in their tracks, and when she realized this Ranger\\nwas climbing fast, almost dragging her, and it was too late to get\\nabove. Helen began to labor. She slid down right in front of Ranger. The\\nintelligent animal, with a snort, plunged out of the trail to keep from\\nstepping on her. Then he was above her.',\n",
       " '“Lookout down there,” yelled Roy, in warning. “Get on the up side!”',\n",
       " \"But that did not appear possible. The earth began to slide under Ranger,\\nand that impeded Helen's progress. He got in advance of her, straining\\non the bridle.\",\n",
       " '“Let go!” yelled Roy.',\n",
       " 'Helen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with\\nRanger. He snorted fiercely, and, rearing high, in a mighty plunge he\\ngained solid ground. Helen was buried to her knees, but, extricating\\nherself, she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther.',\n",
       " \"“Bad cave in, thet,” was Roy's comment, when at last she joined him and\\nBo at the top.\",\n",
       " 'Roy appeared at a loss as to which way to go. He rode to high ground and\\nlooked in all directions. To Helen, one way appeared as wild and rough\\nas another, and all was yellow, green, and black under the westering\\nsun. Roy rode a short distance in one direction, then changed for\\nanother.',\n",
       " 'Presently he stopped.',\n",
       " \"“Wal, I'm shore turned round,” he said.\",\n",
       " \"“You're not lost?” cried Bo.\",\n",
       " \"“Reckon I've been thet for a couple of hours,” he replied, cheerfully.\\n“Never did ride across here I had the direction, but I'm blamed now if I\\ncan tell which way thet was.”\",\n",
       " 'Helen gazed at him in consternation.',\n",
       " '“Lost!” she echoed.',\n",
       " \"A silence ensued, fraught with poignant fear for Helen, as she gazed\\ninto Bo's whitening face. She read her sister's mind. Bo was remembering\\ntales of lost people who never were found.\",\n",
       " \"“Me an' Milt get lost every day,” said Roy. “You don't suppose any man\\ncan know all this big country. It's nothin' for us to be lost.”\",\n",
       " '“Oh!... I was lost when I was little,” said Bo.',\n",
       " \"“Wal, I reckon it'd been better not to tell you so offhand like,”\\n replied Roy, contritely. “Don't feel bad, now. All I need is a peek at\\nOld Baldy. Then I'll have my bearin'. Come on.”\",\n",
       " \"Helen's confidence returned as Roy led off at a fast trot. He rode\\ntoward the westering sun, keeping to the ridge they had ascended, until\\nonce more he came out upon a promontory. Old Baldy loomed there, blacker\\nand higher and closer. The dark forest showed round, yellow, bare spots\\nlike parks.\",\n",
